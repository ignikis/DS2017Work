  For she, that is my verray sorowes grounde,
  Wol with her grace no wyse my sorowes sounde.

    From MS. Harl. 7578, fol. 15, back. No title but 'Balade'; but it is

    But, whan I were from you, unteye my reyne,
    And, for the tyme, drawe in another cheyne.
  But woldè god that alle swich were y-knowe,

NOTES TO THE PRECEDING POEMS.

       *       *       *       *       *

    XXIV.--I take the title from l. 25; cf. Troil. i. 287.

    The metre exhibits the nine-line stanza, as in Anelida, 211-9; but the
    same rimes recur in all three stanzas. The six-line Envoy, with the
    rime-formula _a b a b a a_, is unique in Chaucer. There are nineteen
    lines ending in _-aunce_, twelve in _-esse_, and two in _-ede_.

    1. Note how ll. 1 and 2 are re-echoed in ll. 32, 33. For a similar
    effect, see Anelida, 211, 350.

    8. _ful chose_, fully chosen; parallel to _ful drive_ in C. T., F 1230.

    14. _souvenance_, remembrance; not found elswhere in Chaucer.

    16. _humblely_ is trisyllabic; see Leg. 156, Troil. ii. 1719, v. 1354.

    20. _lo_ emphasises _swich_; cf. _lo, this_, T. v. 54; _lo, which_, T.
    iv. 1231.

    22. _allegeaunce_, _alleviation_; the verb _allegge_ is in the
    Glossary.

    26. _outrance_, extreme violence, great hurt; see Godefroy.

    27. _unbuxumnesse_, unsubmissiveness; cf. _buxumnesse_, Truth, 15.

    XXV.--I take the title from l. 26; cf. Compl. to his Lady, 41, 64.

    1. Cf. Amorous Complaint, 87; Troil. v. 1318, i. 960.

    3. 'Love hath me taught no more of his art,' &c.; Compl. to his Lady,
    42-3.

    9. Cf. Compl. of Mars, 13, 14; p. xxx above, l. 43; Parl. Foules,
    386-9; Amorous Complaint, 85-6.

    19. _eche_, augment; 'hir sorwes _eche_,' T. i. 705.

    27. 'And to your trouthe ay I me recomaunde;' T. v. 1414. 'I am a
    _boistous_ man;' C. T., H 211.

    XXVI.--I take the title from l. 12; see T. v. 232, 638, 1392.

    7. _sounde_, heal, cure; as in Anelida, 242.

    8. Perhaps read _hertes sorwes leche_; see T. ii. 1066.

    10. Cf. 'as _in_ his speche;' T. ii. 1069.

    26. _impresse_; cf. T. ii. 1371.

    [xxxii] 28. _spille_; cf. Compl. to his Lady, 121.

    32. _reyne_, bridle. For this image, cf. Anelida, 184.

    39. MS. _deth the kerue_. As _e_ and _o_ are constantly confused, the
    prefix _to_ (written apart) may have looked like _te_, and would easily
    be altered to _the_. Cf. _forkerveth_ in the Manc. Tale, H 340.

    47. Here _spac-e_ rimes with _embrac-e_, but in l. 5 it rimes with
    _allas_. This variation is no worse than the riming of _embrace_ with
    _compas_ in Proverbs, 8 (vol. i. p. 407). Cf. _plac-e_ in C.T., B 1910,
    with its variant _plas_, B 1971.

    N.B. The Complaints numbered XXV and XXVI are obviously by the same
    author; compare XXV. 26 with XXVI. 15; XXV. 9 with XXVI. 43; and XXV.
    29-31 with XXVI. 39, 40. They were probably written nearly at the same
    time.

  The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne

  And smale fowles maken melodye,

  Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
  (And palmers for to seken straunge strondes)
  To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
  And specially, from every shires ende                         15

  To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,

  At night was come in-to that hostelrye
  Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,

  That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;

  And wel we weren esed atte beste.
  And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,                     30

  To telle yow al the condicioun
  Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
  And whiche they weren, and of what degree;                    40

  That fro the tyme that he first bigan
  To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,                             45
  Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
  Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
  And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre)
  As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse,
  And ever honoured for his worthinesse.                        50

    49. Hn. Hl. as; _rest_ as in.

    At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne;
  Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne
  Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce.
  In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,
  No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.                         55
  In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be
  Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.
  At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye,
  [3: T. 59-92.]
  Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See
  At many a noble aryve hadde he be.                            60
  At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,
  And foughten for our feith at Tramissene
  In listes thryes, and ay slayn his foo.
  This ilke worthy knight had been also
  Somtyme with the lord of Palatye,                             65
  Ageyn another hethen in Turkye:
  And evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys.
  And though that he were worthy, he was wys,
  And of his port as meke as is a mayde.
  He never yet no vileinye ne sayde                             70
  In al his lyf, un-to no maner wight.
  He was a verray parfit gentil knight.
  But for to tellen yow of his array,
  His hors were gode, but he was nat gay.
  Of fustian he wered a gipoun                                  75
  Al bismotered with his habergeoun;
  For he was late y-come from his viage,

  A lovyere, and a lusty bacheler,                              80
  With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse.
  Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.
  Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,
  And wonderly deliver, and greet of strengthe.
  And he had been somtyme in chivachye,                         85
  In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye,
  And born him wel, as of so litel space,
  In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
  Embrouded was he, as it were a mede
  Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede.                    90
  Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day;
  He was as fresh as is the month of May.
  [4: T. 93-127.]
  Short was his goune, with sleves longe and wyde.
  Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ryde.
  He coude songes make and wel endyte,                          95
  Iuste and eek daunce, and wel purtreye and wryte,
  So hote he lovede, that by nightertale
  He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale.
  Curteys he was, lowly, and servisable,
  And carf biforn his fader at the table.                      100

    A YEMAN hadde he, and servaunts namo                    YEMAN.
  At that tyme, for him liste ryde so;
  And he was clad in cote and hood of grene;
  A sheef of pecok-arwes brighte and kene
  Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;                         105
  (Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:
  His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),
  And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.
  A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.
  Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage.                     110
  Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
  And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,
  And on that other syde a gay daggere,
  Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere;
  A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene.                    115
  An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
  A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.

    Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,                 PRIORESSE.
  That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy;
  Hir gretteste ooth was but by sëynt Loy;                     120
  And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.
  Ful wel she song the service divyne,
  Entuned in hir nose ful semely;
  And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,
  After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,                      125
  For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe.
  At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;
  [5: T. 128-161.]
  She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,
  Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.
  Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,                  130
  That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest.
  In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest.
  Hir over lippe wyped she so clene,
  That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene
  Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.               135
  Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,
  And sikerly she was of greet disport,
  And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,
  And peyned hir to countrefete chere
  Of court, and been estatlich of manere,                      140
  And to ben holden digne of reverence.
  But, for to speken of hir conscience,
  She was so charitable and so pitous,
  She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous
  Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.               145
  Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde
  With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.
  But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,
  Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:
  And al was conscience and tendre herte.                      150
  Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;
  Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas;
  Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed;
  But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;
  It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;                       155
  For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.
  Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.
  Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar
  A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;
  And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene,                 160
  On which ther was first write a crowned A,
  [6: T. 162-195.]
  And after, _Amor vincit omnia._

    A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrye,                MONK.
  An out-rydere, that lovede venerye;                          166
  A manly man, to been an abbot able.
  Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable:
  And, whan he rood, men mighte his brydel here
  Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere,                        170
  And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,
  Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
  The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
  By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
  This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,                       175
  And held after the newe world the space.
  He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,
  That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;
  Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees,
  Is lykned til a fish that is waterlees;                      180
  This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.
  But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre;
  And I seyde, his opinioun was good.
  What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood,
  Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,                      185
  Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,
  As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?
  Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.
  Therfore he was a pricasour aright;
  Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight;           190
  Of priking and of hunting for the hare
  Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
  I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond
  With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;
  And, for to festne his hood under his chin,                  195
  [7: T. 196-231.]
  He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin:
  A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.
  His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,
  And eek his face, as he had been anoint.
  He was a lord ful fat and in good point;                     200
  His eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed,
  That stemed as a forneys of a leed;
  His botes souple, his hors in greet estat.
  Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;
  He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost.                        205
  A fat swan loved he best of any roost.
  His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.

    A FRERE ther was, a wantown and a merye,                FRERE.
  A limitour, a ful solempne man.
  In alle the ordres foure is noon that can                    210
  So muche of daliaunce and fair langage.
  He hadde maad ful many a mariage
  Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
  Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.
  Ful wel biloved and famulier was he                          215
  With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,
  And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:
  For he had power of confessioun,
  As seyde him-self, more than a curat,
  For of his ordre he was licentiat.                           220
  Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
  And plesaunt was his absolucioun;
  He was an esy man to yeve penaunce
  Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce;
  For unto a povre ordre for to yive                           225
  Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.
  For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
  He wiste that a man was repentaunt.
  For many a man so hard is of his herte,
  He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.                    230
  Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,
  [8: T. 232-265.]
  Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.
  His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves
  And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.
  And certeinly he hadde a mery note;                          235
  Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.
  Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys.
  His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;
  Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.
  He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,                      240
  And everich hostiler and tappestere
  Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;
  For un-to swich a worthy man as he
  Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
  To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.                       245
  It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce
  For to delen with no swich poraille,
  But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
  And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
  Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.                        250
  Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
  He was the beste beggere in his hous;
  [And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;                   252 b
  Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]              252 c
  For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
  So plesaunt was his "_In principio_,"
  Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.                   255
  His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
  And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.
  In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.                  (260)
  For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer,
  With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler,                  260
  But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
  Of double worsted was his semi-cope,
  That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
  [9: T. 266-300.]
  Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
  To make his English swete up-on his tonge;                   265
  And in his harping, whan that he had songe,
  His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,
  As doon the sterres in the frosty night.                   (270)
  This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd.

    A MARCHANT was ther with a forked berd,              MARCHANT.
  In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat,                        271
  Up-on his heed a Flaundrish bever hat;
  His botes clasped faire and fetisly.
  His resons he spak ful solempnely,
  Souninge alway thencrees of his winning.                     275
  He wolde the see were kept for any thing
  Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.
  Wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.                  (280)
  This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;
  Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette,                    280
  So estatly was he of his governaunce,
  With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce.

    A CLERK ther was of Oxenford also,                      CLERK.
  That un-to logik hadde longe y-go.                           286
  As lene was his hors as is a rake,
  And he nas nat right fat, I undertake;                     (290)
  But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly.
  Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;                       290
  For he had geten him yet no benefyce,
  Ne was so worldly for to have offyce.
  For him was lever have at his beddes heed
  Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,
  Of Aristotle and his philosophye,                            295
  Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye.
  But al be that he was a philosophre,
  Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;                      (300)
  [10: T. 301-336.]
  But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,
  On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,                       300
  And bisily gan for the soules preye
  Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye.
  Of studie took he most cure and most hede.
  Noght o word spak he more than was nede,
  And that was seyd in forme and reverence,                    305
  And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence.
  Souninge in moral vertu was his speche,

    A SERGEANT OF THE LAWE, war and wys,              MAN OF LAWE.
  That often hadde been at the parvys,                         310
  Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.
  Discreet he was, and of greet reverence:
  He semed swich, his wordes weren so wyse.
  Iustyce he was ful often in assyse,
  By patente, and by pleyn commissioun;                        315
  For his science, and for his heigh renoun
  Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.
  So greet a purchasour was no-wher noon.                    (320)
  Al was fee simple to him in effect,
  His purchasing mighte nat been infect.                       320
  No-wher so bisy a man as he ther nas,
  And yet he semed bisier than he was.
  In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,
  That from the tyme of king William were falle.
  Therto he coude endyte, and make a thing,                    325
  Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting;
  And every statut coude he pleyn by rote.
  He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote                        (330)

    A FRANKELEYN was in his companye;                  FRANKELEYN.
  Whyt was his berd, as is the dayesye.
  Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.
  Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn.
  [11: T. 337-370.]
  To liven in delyt was ever his wone,                         335
  For he was Epicurus owne sone,
  That heeld opinioun, that pleyn delyt
  Was verraily felicitee parfyt.
  An housholdere, and that a greet, was he;                  (340)
  Seint Iulian he was in his contree.
  His breed, his ale, was alwey after oon;
  A bettre envyned man was no-wher noon.
  With-oute bake mete was never his hous,
  Of fish and flesh, and that so plentevous,
  It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,                    345
  Of alle deyntees that men coude thinke.
  After the sondry sesons of the yeer,
  So chaunged he his mete and his soper.                     (350)
  Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe,
  And many a breem and many a luce in stewe.                   350
  Wo was his cook, but-if his sauce were
  Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his gere.
  His table dormant in his halle alway
  Stood redy covered al the longe day.
  At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;                      355
  Ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire.
  An anlas and a gipser al of silk
  Heng at his girdel, whyt as morne milk.                    (360)
  A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour;

  For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.
  He rood up-on a rouncy, as he couthe,                        390
  In a gowne of falding to the knee.
  A daggere hanging on a laas hadde he
  Aboute his nekke under his arm adoun.

  And, certeinly, he was a good felawe.                        395
  Ful many a draughte of wyn had he y-drawe
  From Burdeux-ward, whyl that the chapman sleep.

  With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake.

  From Gootlond to the cape of Finistere,                    (410)

    With us ther was a DOCTOUR OF PHISYK,                 DOCTOUR.
  In al this world ne was ther noon him lyk
  To speke of phisik and of surgerye;
  For he was grounded in astronomye.
  He kepte his pacient a ful greet del                         415
  In houres, by his magik naturel.
  Wel coude he fortunen the ascendent
  Of his images for his pacient.                             (420)
  He knew the cause of everich maladye,
  Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste, or drye,                 420
  And where engendred, and of what humour;
  He was a verrey parfit practisour.
  The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the rote,
  Anon he yaf the seke man his bote.
  Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries,                          425
  To sende him drogges and his letuaries,
  For ech of hem made other for to winne;
  Hir frendschipe nas nat newe to biginne.                   (430)

  Old Ypocras, Haly, and Galien;

  Of his diete mesurable was he,                               435
  For it was of no superfluitee,
  But of greet norissing and digestible.
  His studie was but litel on the Bible.                     (440)
  In sangwin and in pers he clad was al,
  [14: T. 442-478.]
  Lyned with taffata and with sendal;                          440
  And yet he was but esy of dispence;
  He kepte that he wan in pestilence.
  For gold in phisik is a cordial,
  Therfore he lovede gold in special.

    A good WYF was ther of bisyde BATHE,             WYF OF BATHE.
  But she was som-del deef, and that was scathe.               446
  Of clooth-making she hadde swiche an haunt,
  She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.                      (450)

  And if ther dide, certeyn, so wrooth was she,
  That she was out of alle charitee.

  That on a Sonday were upon hir heed.                         455

  Withouten other companye in youthe;
  But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe.

  At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,                     465
  In Galice at seint Iame, and at Coloigne.
  She coude muche of wandring by the weye.
  Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.                   (470)
  Up-on an amblere esily she sat,
  Y-wimpled wel, and on hir heed an hat                        470

  A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,

    A good man was ther of religioun,                     PERSOUN.
  And was a povre PERSOUN of a toun;                         (480)
  But riche he was of holy thoght and werk.
  He was also a lerned man, a clerk,                           480
  That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;
  His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.
  Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,
  And in adversitee ful pacient;
  And swich he was y-preved ofte sythes.                       485
  Ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes,
  But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,
  Un-to his povre parisshens aboute                          (490)
  Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce.
  He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.                     490
  Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer a-sonder,
  But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder,
  In siknes nor in meschief, to visyte
  The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte,
  Up-on his feet, and in his hand a staf.                      495
  This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,
  That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte;
  Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte;                   (500)
  And this figure he added eek ther-to,
  That if gold ruste, what shal iren do?                       500
  For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste,
  No wonder is a lewed man to ruste;
  And shame it is, if a preest take keep,
  A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.
  Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive,                     505
  By his clennesse, how that his sheep shold live.
  He sette nat his benefice to hyre,
  And leet his sheep encombred in the myre,                  (510)
  And ran to London, un-to sëynt Poules,
  To seken him a chaunterie for soules,                        510
  Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;
  [16: T. 514-547.]
  But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,
  So that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie;
  He was a shepherde and no mercenarie.
  And though he holy were, and vertuous,                       515
  He was to sinful man nat despitous,
  Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne,
  But in his teching discreet and benigne.                   (520)
  To drawen folk to heven by fairnesse
  By good ensample, was his bisinesse:                         520
  But it were any persone obstinat,
  What-so he were, of heigh or lowe estat,
  Him wolde he snibben sharply for the nones.
  A bettre preest, I trowe that nowher noon is.
  He wayted after no pompe and reverence,                      525
  Ne maked him a spyced conscience,
  But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve,
  He taughte, and first he folwed it him-selve.              (530)

    The MILLER was a stout carl, for the nones,            MILLER.
  [17: T. 548-582.]
  Ful big he was of braun, and eek of bones;                   546
  That proved wel, for over-al ther he cam,
  At wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram.                  (550)
  He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,
  Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre,                550
  Or breke it, at a renning, with his heed.
  His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,
  And ther-to brood, as though it were a spade.
  Up-on the cop right of his nose he hade
  A werte, and ther-on stood a tuft of heres,                  555
  Reed as the bristles of a sowes eres;
  His nose-thirles blake were and wyde.
  A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde;                    (560)
  His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys.
  He was a Ianglere and a goliardeys,                          560

  Ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage.
  Ther nas baillif, ne herde, ne other hyne,
  That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne;
  They were adrad of him, as of the deeth.                     605
  His woning was ful fair up-on an heeth,
  With grene treës shadwed was his place.
  He coude bettre than his lord purchace.                    (610)

    A SOMNOUR was ther with us in that place,             SOMNOUR.
  That hadde a fyr-reed cherubinnes face,
  For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe.                      625
  As hoot he was, and lecherous, as a sparwe;
  With scalled browes blake, and piled berd;

  Ne oynement that wolde dense and byte,
  That him mighte helpen of his whelkes whyte,
  Nor of the knobbes sittinge on his chekes.
  Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes,
  And for to drinken strong wyn, reed as blood.                635
  Thanne wolde he speke, and crye as he were wood.
  And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,
  Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn.                     (640)
  A fewe termes hadde he, two or three,
  That he had lerned out of som decree;                        640
  No wonder is, he herde it al the day;
  And eek ye knowen wel, how that a Iay
  Can clepen 'Watte,' as well as can the pope.
  But who-so coude in other thing him grope,
  Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophye;                    645
  Ay '_Questio quid iuris_' wolde he crye.
  He was a gentil harlot and a kinde;
  A bettre felawe sholde men noght finde.                    (650)
  He wolde suffre, for a quart of wyn,
  A good felawe to have his concubyn                           650
  [20: T. 653-687.]
  A twelf-month, and excuse him atte fulle:
  Ful prively a finch eek coude he pulle.
  And if he fond o-wher a good felawe,
  He wolde techen him to have non awe,
  In swich cas, of the erchedeknes curs,                       655
  But-if a mannes soule were in his purs;
  For in his purs he sholde y-punisshed be.
  'Purs is the erchedeknes helle,' seyde he.                 (660)
  But wel I woot he lyed right in dede;
  Of cursing oghte ech gilty man him drede--                   660
  For curs wol slee, right as assoilling saveth--
  And also war him of a _significavit_.
  In daunger hadde he at his owne gyse
  The yonge girles of the diocyse,
  And knew hir counseil, and was al hir reed.                  665
  A gerland hadde he set up-on his heed,
  As greet as it were for an ale-stake;
  A bokeler hadde he maad him of a cake.                     (670)

    With him ther rood a gentil PARDONER                 PARDONER.
  Of Rouncival, his freend and his compeer,                    670
  That streight was comen fro the court of Rome.
  Ful loude he song, 'Com hider, love, to me.'
  This somnour bar to him a stif burdoun,
  Was never trompe of half so greet a soun.
  This pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,                    675
  But smothe it heng, as dooth a strike of flex;
  By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,
  And ther-with he his shuldres overspradde;                 (680)
  But thinne it lay, by colpons oon and oon;
  But hood, for Iolitee, ne wered he noon,                     680
  For it was trussed up in his walet.
  Him thoughte, he rood al of the newe Iet;
  Dischevele, save his cappe, he rood al bare.
  Swiche glaringe eyen hadde he as an hare.
  A vernicle hadde he sowed on his cappe.                      685
  [21: T. 688-722.]
  His walet lay biforn him in his lappe,
  Bret-ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot.
  A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot.                    (690)
  No berd hadde he, ne never sholde have,
  As smothe it was as it were late y-shave;                    690
  I trowe he were a gelding or a mare.
  But of his craft, fro Berwik into Ware,
  Ne was ther swich another pardoner.
  For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,
  Which that, he seyde, was our lady veyl:                     695
  He seyde, he hadde a gobet of the seyl
  That sëynt Peter hadde, whan that he wente
  Up-on the see, til Iesu Crist him hente.                   (700)
  He hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones,
  And in a glas he hadde pigges bones.                         700
  But with thise relikes, whan that he fond
  A povre person dwelling up-on lond,
  Up-on a day he gat him more moneye
  Than that the person gat in monthes tweye.
  And thus, with feyned flaterye and Iapes,                    705
  He made the person and the peple his apes.
  But trewely to tellen, atte laste,
  He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.                     (710)
  Wel coude he rede a lessoun or a storie,
  But alderbest he song an offertorie;                         710
  For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,
  He moste preche, and wel affyle his tonge,
  To winne silver, as he ful wel coude;
  Therefore he song so meriely and loude.

    Now have I told you shortly, in a clause,                  715
  Thestat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause
  Why that assembled was this companye
  In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye,                    (720)
  That highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle.
  But now is tyme to yow for to telle                          720
  [22: T. 723-758.]
  How that we baren us that ilke night,
  Whan we were in that hostelrye alight.
  And after wol I telle of our viage,
  And al the remenaunt of our pilgrimage.
  But first I pray yow, of your curteisye,                     725

  For this ye knowen al-so wel as I,                           730
  Who-so shal telle a tale after a man,
  He moot reherce, as ny as ever he can,
  Everich a word, if it be in his charge,
  Al speke he never so rudeliche and large;
  Or elles he moot telle his tale untrewe,                     735
  Or feyne thing, or finde wordes newe.
  He may nat spare, al-thogh he were his brother;
  He moot as wel seye o word as another.                     (740)
  Crist spak him-self ful brode in holy writ,
  And wel ye woot, no vileinye is it.                          740
  Eek Plato seith, who-so that can him rede,
  The wordes mote be cosin to the dede.
  Also I prey yow to foryeve it me,
  Al have I nat set folk in hir degree
  Here in this tale, as that they sholde stonde;               745

  And to the soper sette he us anon;                         (750)
  And served us with vitaille at the beste.
  Strong was the wyn, and wel to drinke us leste.              750
  A semely man our hoste was with-alle
  For to han been a marshal in an halle;
  A large man he was with eyen stepe,

  Bold of his speche, and wys, and wel y-taught,               755

  _Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera gentis_
  _Prelia, laurigero, &c._
                          [Statius, _Theb._ xii. 519.]

  Whylom, as olde stories tellen us,
  Ther was a duk that highte Theseus;                          860
  Of Athenes he was lord and governour,
  And in his tyme swich a conquerour,
  That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
  Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
  What with his wisdom and his chivalrye,                      865
  He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
  That whylom was y-cleped Scithia;
  And weddede the quene Ipolita,                              (10)
  And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree
  With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee,                    870
  And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
  And thus with victorie and with melodye
  Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde,
  And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde.

  How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
  By Theseus, and by his chivalrye;                           (20)
  And of the grete bataille for the nones
  Bitwixen Athenës and Amazones;                               880
  And how asseged was Ipolita,
  The faire hardy quene of Scithia;
  And of the feste that was at hir weddinge,
  [27: T. 886-921.]
  And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge;
  But al that thing I moot as now forbere.                     885
  I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
  And wayke been the oxen in my plough.
  The remenant of the tale is long y-nough.                   (30)

  When he was come almost unto the toun,
  In al his wele and in his moste pryde,                       895
  He was war, as he caste his eye asyde,
  Wher that ther kneled in the hye weye
  A companye of ladies, tweye and tweye,                      (40)
  Ech after other, clad in clothes blake;
  But swich a cry and swich a wo they make,                    900

    The eldest lady of hem alle spak,
  When she hadde swowned with a deedly chere,
  That it was routhe for to seen and here,
  And seyde: 'Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven                 915

  Noght greveth us your glorie and your honour;
  But we biseken mercy and socour.                            (60)

  Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene,
  And fressher than the May with floures newe--

  Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,                      1040
  She was arisen, and al redy dight;
  For May wol have no slogardye a-night.
  The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
  And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte,
  And seith, 'Arys, and do thyn observaunce.'                 1045

  To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
  Y-clothed was she fresh, for to devyse;                    (190)
  Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse,
  Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.                     1050

  And Palamon, this woful prisoner,
  As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,
  [32: T. 1067-1103.]
  Was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh,                 1065
  In which he al the noble citee seigh,
  And eek the gardin, ful of braunches grene,
  Ther-as this fresshe Emelye the shene                      (210)

  And to him-self compleyning of his wo;

  And ther-with-al he bleynte, and cryde 'a!'                (220)
  As though he stongen were un-to the herte.
  And with that cry Arcite anon up-sterte,                    1080
  And seyde, 'Cosin myn, what eyleth thee,

  Why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence?
  For Goddes love, tak al in pacience

  But Venus is it, soothly, as I gesse.'
  And ther-with-al on kneës doun he fil,

  Yow in this gardin thus to transfigure                      1105

  Of hir that rometh in the yonder place;
  And, but I have hir mercy and hir grace,                    1120

  Ever in his lyf, by day or night or stounde

    Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,                     1355
  Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde 'allas,'
  For seen his lady shal he never-mo.
  And shortly to concluden al his wo,                        (500)
  So muche sorwe had never creature
  That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.             1360
  His sleep, his mete, his drink is him biraft,
  That lene he wex, and drye as is a shaft.
  His eyen holwe, and grisly to biholde;
  His hewe falwe, and pale as asshen colde,
  And solitarie he was, and ever allone,                      1365
  And wailling al the night, making his mone.
  And if he herde song or instrument,
  Then wolde he wepe, he mighte nat be stent;                (510)
  So feble eek were his spirits, and so lowe,
  And chaunged so, that no man coude knowe                    1370
  His speche nor his vois, though men it herde.
  And in his gere, for al the world he ferde
  Nat oonly lyk the loveres maladye
  Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye
  Engendred of humour malencolyk,                             1375
  Biforen, in his celle fantastyk.
  And shortly, turned was al up-so-doun

    What sholde I al-day of his wo endyte?                    1380
  Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
  This cruel torment, and this peyne and wo,
  At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
  Up-on a night, in sleep as he him leyde,
  [41: T. 1387-1424.]
  Him thoughte how that the winged god Mercurie               1385
  Biforn him stood, and bad him to be murye.
  His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;
  An hat he werede up-on his heres brighte.                  (530)
  Arrayed was this god (as he took keep)
  As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;                   1390
  And seyde him thus: 'To Athenes shaltou wende;
  Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.'
  And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
  'Now trewely, how sore that me smerte,'
  Quod he, 'to Athenes right now wol I fare;                  1395
  Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
  To see my lady, that I love and serve;
  In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.'                   (540)

    And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
  And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,                  1400
  And saugh his visage al in another kinde.
  And right anoon it ran him in his minde,
  That, sith his face was so disfigured
  Of maladye, the which he hadde endured,
  He mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe,                     1405
  Live in Athenes ever-more unknowe,
  And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
  And right anon he chaunged his array,                      (550)
  And cladde him as a povre laborer,
  And al allone, save oonly a squyer,                         1410
  That knew his privetee and al his cas,
  Which was disgysed povrely, as he was,
  To Athenes is he goon the nexte way.
  And to the court he wente up-on a day,
  And at the gate he profreth his servyse,                    1415
  To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
  And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
  He fil in office with a chamberleyn,                       (560)
  The which that dwelling was with Emelye.
  For he was wys, and coude soon aspye                        1420
  Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
  Wel coude he hewen wode, and water bere,
  [42: T. 1425-1461.]
  For he was yong and mighty for the nones,
  And ther-to be was strong and big of bones
  To doon that any wight can him devyse.                      1425
  A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
  Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte;
  And 'Philostrate' he seide that he highte.                 (570)
  But half so wel biloved a man as he
  Ne was ther never in court, of his degree;                  1430
  He was so gentil of condicioun,
  That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
  They seyden, that it were a charitee
  That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,
  And putten him in worshipful servyse,                       1435
  Ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse.
  And thus, with-inne a whyle, his name is spronge
  Bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge,                   (580)
  That Theseus hath taken him so neer
  That of his chambre he made him a squyer,                   1440
  And yaf him gold to mayntene his degree;
  And eek men broghte him out of his contree
  From yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente;
  But honestly and slyly he it spente,
  That no man wondred how that he it hadde.                   1445
  And three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde,
  And bar him so in pees and eek in werre,
  Ther nas no man that Theseus hath derre.                   (590)
  And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,

  Were it by aventure or destinee,                            1465
  (As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
  That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
  By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,                  (610)
  And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
  For he had yive his gayler drinke so                        1470
  Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
  With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
  That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
  The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
  And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.                 1475
  The night was short, and faste by the day,
  That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,
  And til a grove, faste ther besyde,                        (620)
  With dredful foot than stalketh Palamoun.
  For shortly, this was his opinioun,                         1480
  That in that grove he wolde him hyde al day,
  And in the night than wolde he take his way
  To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
  On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;
  And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lyf,                  1485

  And to the grove, of which that I yow tolde,                1505
  By aventure, his wey he gan to holde,
  To maken him a gerland of the greves,
  Were it of wodebinde or hawethorn-leves,                   (650)
  And loude he song ageyn the sonne shene:
  'May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,                  1510
  Wel-come be thou, faire fresshe May,
  I hope that I som grene gete may.'
  And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
  In-to the grove ful hastily he sterte,
  And in a path he rometh up and doun,                        1515
  Ther-as, by aventure, this Palamoun
  Was in a bush, that no man mighte him see,
  For sore afered of his deeth was he.                       (660)
  No-thing ne knew he that it was Arcite:
  God wot he wolde have trowed it ful lyte.                   1520
  But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many yeres,
  That 'feeld hath eyen, and the wode hath eres.'
  It is ful fair a man to bere him evene,
  For al-day meteth men at unset stevene.
  Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,                        1525
  That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,
  For in the bush he sitteth now ful stille.

  [47: T. 1603-1639.]
  And eek that thou no wepne hast in this place,

  And hereth him come russhing in the greves,
  And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
  And thinketh, 'heer cometh my mortel enemy,

  For outher I mot sleen him at the gappe,                    1645

  For which he hath deserved to be deed.
  For this is he that cam un-to thy gate,

  Hath dampned you, and I wol it recorde,                     1745
  It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.

  And alle the ladies in the companye.                        1750
  Gret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
  That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;
  For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
  And no-thing but for love was this debat;
  And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;                   1755
  And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
  'Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!'
  And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,                    (900)
  And wolde have kist his feet ther-as he stood,
  Til at the laste aslaked was his mood;                      1760
  For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte.
  And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
  He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
  The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause:
  And al-though that his ire hir gilt accused,                1765
  Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused;
  As thus: he thoghte wel, that every man
  Wol helpe him-self in love, if that he can,                (910)
  And eek delivere him-self out of prisoun;
  And eek his herte had compassioun                           1770
  Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon;
  And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon,
  And softe un-to himself he seyde: 'fy
  Up-on a lord that wol have no mercy,
  But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede,                   1775
  To hem that been in repentaunce and drede
  As wel as to a proud despitous man
  That wol maynteyne that he first bigan!                    (920)
  That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
  That in swich cas can no divisioun,                         1780
  But weyeth pryde and humblesse after oon.'
  And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
  He gan to loken up with eyen lighte,
  And spak thise same wordes al on highte:--
  The god of love, a! _benedicite_,                           1785
  [52: T. 1788-1823.]
  How mighty and how greet a lord is he!
  Ayeins his might ther gayneth none obstacles,
  He may be cleped a god for his miracles;                   (930)
  For he can maken at his owne gyse
  Of everich herte, as that him list devyse.                  1790
  Lo heer, this Arcite and this Palamoun,
  That quitly weren out of my prisoun,
  And mighte han lived in Thebes royally,
  And witen I am hir mortal enemy,

  And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,

  That serven love, for aught that may bifalle!               1805
  But this is yet the beste game of alle,
  That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
  Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;                     (950)
  She woot namore of al this hote fare,
  By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!                      1810
  But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
  A man mot been a fool, or yong or old;
  I woot it by my-self ful yore agoon:
  For in my tyme a servant was I oon.
  And therfore, sin I knowe of loves peyne,                   1815
  And woot how sore it can a man distreyne,
  As he that hath ben caught ofte in his las,
  I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespas,                      (960)

    I trowe men wolde deme it necligence,
  If I foryete to tellen the dispence
  Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
  To maken up the listes royally;
  That swich a noble theatre as it was,                       1885
  I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.
  The circuit a myle was aboute,
  Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute.                 (1030)
  Round was the shap, in maner of compas,
  Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,                   1890
  [55: T. 1893-1928.]
  That, whan a man was set on o degree,

    Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt,
  West-ward, right swich another in the opposit.
  And shortly to concluden, swich a place                     1895
  Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;
  For in the lond ther nas no crafty man,
  That geometrie or ars-metrik can,                         (1040)
  Ne purtreyour, ne kerver of images,
  That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages                      1900
  The theatre for to maken and devyse.
  And for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse,
  He est-ward hath, up-on the gate above,
  In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
  Don make an auter and an oratorie;                          1905
  And west-ward, in the minde and in memorie
  Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
  That coste largely of gold a fother.                      (1050)
  And north-ward, in a touret on the wal,
  Of alabastre whyt and reed coral                            1910
  An oratorie riche for to see,
  In worship of Dyane of chastitee,
  Hath Theseus don wroght in noble wyse.

    But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
  The noble kerving, and the portreitures,                    1915
  The shap, the countenaunce, and the figures,
  That weren in thise oratories three.

    First in the temple of Venus maystow see                (1060)
  Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
  The broken slepes, and the sykes colde;                     1920
  The sacred teres, and the waymenting;
  The fyry strokes of the desiring,
  That loves servaunts in this lyf enduren;
  The othes, that hir covenants assuren;
  Plesaunce and hope, desyr, fool-hardinesse,                 1925
  Beautee and youthe, bauderie, richesse,
  [56: T. 1929-1963.]
  Charmes and force, lesinges, flaterye,
  Dispense, bisynesse, and Ielousye,                        (1070)
  That wered of yelwe goldes a gerland,
  And a cokkow sitting on hir hand;                           1930
  Festes, instruments, caroles, daunces,
  Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
  Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal,
  By ordre weren peynted on the wal,
  And mo than I can make of mencioun.                         1935
  For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
  Ther Venus hath hir principal dwelling,
  Was shewed on the wal in portreying,                      (1080)
  With al the gardin, and the lustinesse.
  Nat was foryeten the porter Ydelnesse,                      1940
  Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,
  Ne yet the folye of king Salamon,
  Ne yet the grete strengthe of Hercules--
  Thenchauntements of Medea and Circes--
  Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,                  1945
  The riche Cresus, caytif in servage.
  Thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse,
  Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe, ne hardinesse,            (1090)
  Ne may with Venus holde champartye;
  For as hir list the world than may she gye.                 1950
  Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,
  Til they for wo ful ofte seyde 'allas!'
  Suffyceth heer ensamples oon or two,
  And though I coude rekne a thousand mo.

    The statue of Venus, glorious for to see,                 1955
  Was naked fleting in the large see,
  And fro the navele doun all covered was
  With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.                (1100)
  A citole in hir right hand hadde she,
  And on hir heed, ful semely for to see,                     1960
  A rose gerland, fresh and wel smellinge;

    Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
  The portreiture, that was up-on the wal                   (1110)
  With-inne the temple of mighty Mars the rede?
  Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,               1970
  Lyk to the estres of the grisly place,
  That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
  In thilke colde frosty regioun,
  Ther-as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.

    First on the wal was peynted a foreste,                   1975
  In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste,
  With knotty knarry bareyn treës olde
  Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;                  (1120)
  In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough,
  As though a storm sholde bresten every bough:               1980
  And downward from an hille, under a bente,
  Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,
  Wroght al of burned steel, of which thentree
  Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.
  And ther-out cam a rage and such a vese,                    1985
  That it made al the gates for to rese.
  The northren light in at the dores shoon,
  For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,                  (1130)
  Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
  The dores were alle of adamant eterne,                      1990
  Y-clenched overthwart and endelong
  With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
  Every piler, the temple to sustene,
  Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.

  [58: T. 1998-2033.]
  Of felonye, and al the compassing;
  The cruel ire, reed as any glede;
  The pykepurs, and eek the pale drede;                     (1140)
  The smyler with the knyf under the cloke;
  The shepne brenning with the blake smoke;                   2000
  The treson of the mordring in the bedde;
  The open werre, with woundes al bi-bledde;
  Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace;
  Al ful of chirking was that sory place.
  The sleere of him-self yet saugh I ther,                    2005
  His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer;
  The nayl y-driven in the shode a-night;
  The colde deeth, with mouth gaping up-right.              (1150)
  Amiddes of the temple sat meschaunce,
  With disconfort and sory contenaunce.                       2010
  Yet saugh I woodnesse laughing in his rage;
  Armed compleint, out-hees, and fiers outrage.
  The careyne in the bush, with throte y-corve:
  A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm y-storve;
  The tiraunt, with the prey by force y-raft;                 2015
  The toun destroyed, ther was no-thing laft.
  Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres;
  The hunte strangled with the wilde beres:                 (1160)
  The sowe freten the child right in the cradel;
  The cook y-scalded, for al his longe ladel.                 2020
  Noght was foryeten by the infortune of Marte;
  The carter over-riden with his carte,
  Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
  Ther were also, of Martes divisioun,
  The barbour, and the bocher, and the smith                  2025
  That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith.
  And al above, depeynted in a tour,

  Hanginge by a sotil twynes threed.                          2030

  So was it shewed in that portreiture

  Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.                 (1180)

  As shortly as I can I wol me haste,

  Depeynted been the walles up and doun
  Of hunting and of shamfast chastitee.                       2055

  Was turned from a womman til a bere,                      (1200)
  And after was she maad the lode-sterre;
  Thus was it peynt, I can say yow no ferre;                  2060
  Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.
  Ther saugh I Dane, y-turned til a tree,

  But Penneus doughter, which that highte Dane.
  Ther saugh I Attheon an hert y-maked,                       2065
  For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;
  I saugh how that his houndes have him caught,
  [60: T. 2070-2106.]
  And freten him, for that they knewe him naught.           (1210)
  Yet peynted was a litel forther-moor,
  How Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,                       2070
  And Meleagre, and many another mo,
  For which Diane wroghte him care and wo.
  Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
  The whiche me list nat drawen to memorie.
  This goddesse on an hert ful hye seet,                      2075
  With smale houndes al aboute hir feet;
  And undernethe hir feet she hadde a mone,
  Wexing it was, and sholde wanie sone.                     (1220)
  In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,
  With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas.                     2080
  Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun,
  Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
  A womman travailinge was hir biforn,
  But, for hir child so longe was unborn,
  Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calle,                          2085
  And seyde, 'help, for thou mayst best of alle.'

    Duk Theseus, with al his companye,                        2700
  Is comen hoom to Athenes his citee,
  With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
  Al be it that this aventure was falle,
  He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.
  Men seyde eek, that Arcite shal nat dye;                    2705
  He shal ben heled of his maladye.
  And of another thing they were as fayn,
  That of hem alle was ther noon y-slayn,                   (1850)
  Al were they sore y-hurt, and namely oon,
  That with a spere was thirled his brest-boon.               2710
  To othere woundes, and to broken armes,
  Some hadden salves, and some hadden charmes;
  Fermacies of herbes, and eek save
  They dronken, for they wolde hir limes have.
  For which this noble duk, as he wel can,                    2715
  Conforteth and honoureth every man,
  And made revel al the longe night,
  Un-to the straunge lordes, as was right.                  (1860)
  Ne ther was holden no disconfitinge,
  But as a Iustes or a tourneyinge;                           2720
  For soothly ther was no disconfiture,
  For falling nis nat but an aventure;
  Ne to be lad with fors un-to the stake
  Unyolden, and with twenty knightes take,
  O persone allone, with-outen mo,                            2725
  And haried forth by arme, foot, and to,
  And eek his stede driven forth with staves,

  And either syde y-lyk, as otheres brother;
  And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,                        2735
  And fully heeld a feste dayes three;
  And conveyed the kinges worthily
  Out of his toun a Iournee largely.                        (1880)
  And hoom wente every man the righte way.
  Ther was namore, but 'far wel, have good day!'              2740

  Corrupteth, and is in his bouk y-laft,

  To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,

  For which this noble Theseus anon                           2975
  Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
  Unwist of him what was the cause and why;
  But in his blake clothes sorwefully                       (2120)

  Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,
  And Theseus abiden hadde a space
  Er any word cam from his wyse brest,
  His eyen sette he ther as was his lest,
  [85: T. 2987-3020.]
  And with a sad visage he syked stille,                      2985

  Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,              (2130)
  Greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
  Wel wiste he why, and what ther-of he mente;                2990
  For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
  The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond
  In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee;

  So that unnethe up-on his hors he sat,
  He nolde avalen neither hood ne hat,
  Ne abyde no man for his curteisye,
  But in Pilates vois he gan to crye,
  And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,                  3125

  Whylom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
  A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
  And of his craft he was a Carpenter.
  With him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler,                 3190
  Had lerned art, but al his fantasye
  Was turned for to lerne astrologye,
  And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns

  And ther-to be was sleigh and ful privee,
  And lyk a mayden meke for to see.

  Allone, with-outen any companye,
  Ful fetisly y-dight with herbes swote;                      3205
  And he him-self as swete as is the rote                     (20)

  On shelves couched at his beddes heed:
  His presse y-covered with a falding reed.
  And al above ther lay a gay sautrye,
  On which he made a nightes melodye
  [93: T. 3215-3250.]
  So swetely, that al the chambre rong;                       3215
  And _Angelus ad virginem_ he song;                          (30)
  And after that he song the kinges note;

  That bad man sholde wedde his similitude.
  Men sholde wedden after hir estaat,
  For youthe and elde is often at debaat.                     3230

  Whyt was hir smok, and brouded al bifore
  And eek bihinde, on hir coler aboute,
  Of col-blak silk, with-inne and eek with-oute.              3240
  The tapes of hir whyte voluper
  Were of the same suyte of hir coler;

  And sikerly she hadde a likerous yë.
  Ful smale y-pulled were hir browes two,                     3245
  And tho were bent, and blake as any sloo.                   (60)

  Than is the newe pere-ionette tree;
  And softer than the wolle is of a wether.

  As any kide or calf folwinge his dame.                      3260
  Hir mouth was swete as bragot or the meeth,
  Or hord of apples leyd in hey or heeth.
  Winsinge she was, as is a Ioly colt,
  Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.
  A brooch she baar up-on hir lowe coler,                     3265
  As brood as is the bos of a bocler.                         (80)
  Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye;

  'Ye moste been ful derne, as in this cas.'

    'Nay ther-of care thee noght,' quod Nicholas,
  'A clerk had litherly biset his whyle,
  But-if he coude a Carpenter bigyle.'                        3300
  And thus they been acorded and y-sworn
  To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.
  Whan Nicholas had doon thus everydeel,
  And thakked hir aboute the lendes weel,
  He kist hir swete, and taketh his sautrye,                  3305
  And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodye.                     (120)

    3289. E. hir; _rest_ him.

    Than fil it thus, that to the parish-chirche,
  Cristes owne werkes for to wirche,
  This gode wyf wente on an haliday;
  Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,                     3310
  So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.

    Now was ther of that chirche a parish-clerk,
  The which that was y-cleped Absolon.
  Crul was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,
  And strouted as a fanne large and brode;                    3315
  Ful streight and even lay his Ioly shode.                  (130)
  His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos;
  With Powles window corven on his shoos,
  In hoses rede he wente fetisly.
  Y-clad he was ful smal and proprely,                        3320
  Al in a kirtel of a light wachet;
  Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set.
  [96: T. 3323-3358.]
  And ther-up-on he hadde a gay surplys
  As whyt as is the blosme up-on the rys.
  A mery child he was, so god me save,                        3325
  Wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave,             (140)
  And make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.
  In twenty manere coude he trippe and daunce
  After the scole of Oxenforde tho,
  And with his legges casten to and fro,                      3330
  And pleyen songes on a small rubible;
  Ther-to he song som-tyme a loud quinible;
  And as wel coude he pleye on his giterne.
  In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
  That he ne visited with his solas,                          3335
  Ther any gaylard tappestere was.                           (150)
  But sooth to seyn, he was somdel squaymous
  Of farting, and of speche daungerous.

  And many a lovely look on hem he caste,
  And namely on this carpenteres wyf.
  To loke on hir him thoughte a mery lyf,
  She was so propre and swete and likerous.                   3345

  For curteisye, he seyde, he wolde noon.
  The mone, whan it was night, ful brighte shoon,
  And Absolon his giterne hath y-take,
  For paramours, he thoghte for to wake.
  And forth he gooth, Iolif and amorous,                      3353
  Til he cam to the carpenteres hous                         (170)
  A litel after cokkes hadde y-crowe;
  And dressed him up by a shot-windowe
  [97: T. 3359-3392.]
  That was up-on the carpenteres wal.
  He singeth in his vois gentil and smal,                     3360
  'Now, dere lady, if thy wille be,
  I preye yow that ye wol rewe on me,'
  Ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge.
  This carpenter awook, and herde him singe,
  And spak un-to his wyf, and seyde anon,                     3365
  'What! Alison! herestow nat Absolon                        (180)

  He woweth hir by menes and brocage,                         3375
  And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;                     (190)
  He singeth, brokkinge as a nightingale;
  He sente hir piment, meeth, and spyced ale,
  And wafres, pyping hote out of the glede;
  And for she was of toune, he profred mede.                  3380

  That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;
  He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn;
  And thus she maketh Absolon hir ape,

  Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,
  Men seyn right thus, 'alwey the nye slye
  [98: T. 3393-3429.]

  And so bifel it on a Saterday,
  This carpenter was goon til Osenay;                         3400
  And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
  Acorded been to this conclusioun,
  That Nicholas shal shapen him a wyle
  This sely Ialous housbond to bigyle;
  And if so be the game wente aright,                         3405
  She sholde slepen in his arm al night,                     (220)
  For this was his desyr and hir also.
  And right anon, with-outen wordes mo,
  This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,
  But doth ful softe un-to his chambre carie                  3410
  Bothe mete and drinke for a day or tweye,
  And to hir housbonde bad hir for to seye,
  If that he axed after Nicholas,
  She sholde seye she niste where he was,
  Of al that day she saugh him nat with yë;                   3415
  She trowed that he was in maladye,                         (230)
  For, for no cry, hir mayde coude him calle;

  That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,                    3420
  And eet and sleep, or dide what him leste,
  Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.

    This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle
  Of Nicholas, or what thing mighte him eyle,
  And seyde, 'I am adrad, by seint Thomas,                    3425
  It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.                      (240)
  God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!
  This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
  I saugh to-day a cors y-born to chirche
  [99: T. 3430-3465.]
  That now, on Monday last, I saugh him wirche.               3430

    Go up,' quod he un-to his knave anoon,
  'Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon,
  Loke how it is, and tel me boldely.'

    This knave gooth him up ful sturdily,
  And at the chambre-dore, whyl that he stood,                3435
  He cryde and knokked as that he were wood:--               (250)
  'What! how! what do ye, maister Nicholay?
  How may ye slepen al the longe day?'

    But al for noght, he herde nat a word;
  An hole he fond, ful lowe up-on a bord,                     3440
  Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe;
  And at that hole he looked in ful depe,
  And at the laste he hadde of him a sighte.
  This Nicholas sat gaping ever up-righte,
  As he had kyked on the newe mone.                           3445

  So ferde another clerk with astromye;
  He walked in the feeldes for to prye

  Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas                      3855
  Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
  Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
  But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde,
  Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,
  But it were only Osewold the Reve,                          3860
  By-cause he was of carpenteres craft.
  A litel ire is in his herte y-laft,
  He gan to grucche and blamed it a lyte.

  To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl,

  HERE BIGINNETH THE REVES TALE.

  At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,
  Ther goth a brook and over that a brigge,
  Up-on the whiche brook ther stant a melle;
  And this is verray soth that I yow telle.
  A Miller was ther dwelling many a day;                      3925
  As eny pecok he was proud and gay.
  Pypen he coude and fisshe, and nettes bete,
  And turne coppes, and wel wrastle and shete;
  And by his belt he baar a long panade,
  And of a swerd ful trenchant was the blade.                 3930
  A Ioly popper baar he in his pouche;                        (11)
  Ther was no man for peril dorste him touche.
  A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose;
  Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.
  As piled as an ape was his skulle.                          3935
  He was a market-beter atte fulle.
  Ther dorste no wight hand up-on him legge,
  That he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge.
  A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele,
  And that a sly, and usaunt for to stele.                    3940
  His name was hoten dëynous Simkin.                          (21)
  A wyf he hadde, y-comen of noble kin;
  The person of the toun hir fader was.
  With hir he yaf ful many a panne of bras,
  For that Simkin sholde in his blood allye.                  3945
  [115: T. 3944-3976.]
  She was y-fostred in a nonnerye;
  For Simkin wolde no wyf, as he sayde,
  But she were wel y-norissed and a mayde,
  To saven his estaat of yomanrye.
  And she was proud, and pert as is a pye.                    3950
  A ful fair sighte was it on hem two;                        (31)
  On haly-dayes biforn hir wolde he go
  With his tipet bounden about his heed,
  And she cam after in a gyte of reed;
  And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.                         3955
  Ther dorste no wight clepen hir but 'dame.'
  Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye
  That with hir dorste rage or ones pleye,
  But-if he wolde be slayn of Simkin
  With panade, or with knyf, or boydekin.                     3960
  For Ialous folk ben perilous evermo,                        (41)
  Algate they wolde hir wyves wenden so.
  And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,
  She was as digne as water in a dich;
  And ful of hoker and of bisemare.                           3965
  Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hir spare,
  What for hir kinrede and hir nortelrye
  That she had lerned in the nonnerye.

  Savinge a child that was of half-yeer age;                  (51)
  In cradel it lay and was a propre page.
  This wenche thikke and wel y-growen was,
  With camuse nose and yën greye as glas;
  With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye,             3975

  [116: T. 3977-4012.]
  Bothe of his catel and his messuage,
  And straunge he made it of hir mariage.                     3980
  His purpos was for to bistowe hir hye                       (61)
  In-to som worthy blood of auncetrye;
  For holy chirches good moot been despended
  On holy chirches blood, that is descended.
  Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure,                   3985
  Though that he holy chirche sholde devoure.

    Gret soken hath this miller, out of doute,
  With whete and malt of al the land aboute;

  Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt y-grounde.              (71)
  And on a day it happed, in a stounde,
  Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye;
  Men wenden wisly that he sholde dye.
  For which this miller stal bothe mele and corn              3995
  An hundred tyme more than biforn;
  For ther-biforn he stal but curteisly,
  But now he was a theef outrageously,
  For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare.
  But ther-of sette the miller nat a tare;                    4000
  He craketh boost, and swoor it was nat so.                  (81)

    Than were ther yonge povre clerkes two,
  That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye.
  Testif they were, and lusty for to pleye,
  And, only for hir mirthe and revelrye,                      4005
  Up-on the wardeyn bisily they crye,
  To yeve hem leve but a litel stounde
  To goon to mille and seen hir corn y-grounde;
  And hardily, they dorste leye hir nekke,
  The miller shold nat stele hem half a pekke                 4010
  Of corn by sleighte, ne by force hem reve;                  (91)
  And at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve.

  For thefte and riot, they ben convertible,                  4395
  Al conne he pleye on giterne or ribible.

    This Ioly prentis with his maister bood,

  Al were he snibbed bothe erly and late,
  And somtyme lad with revel to Newgate;
  But atte laste his maister him bithoghte,
  Up-on a day, whan he his paper soghte,                      (40)
  Of a proverbe that seith this same word,                    4405
  'Wel bet is roten appel out of hord
  Than that it rotie al the remenaunt.'
  So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
  It is wel lasse harm to lete him pace,
  Than he shende alle the servants in the place.              4410
  Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance,
  And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance;
  And thus this Ioly prentis hadde his leve.
  Now lat him riote al the night or leve.                     (50)

  That helpeth him to wasten and to souke
  Of that he brybe can or borwe may,
  Anon he sente his bed and his array
  Un-to a compeer of his owne sort,
  That lovede dys and revel and disport,                      4420

  THE WORDES OF THE HOOST TO THE COMPANYE.

  Our Hoste sey wel that the brighte sonne
  The ark of his artificial day had ronne
  The fourthe part, and half an houre, and more;
  And though he were not depe expert in lore,
  He wiste it was the eightetethe day                            5
  Of April, that is messager to May;
  And sey wel that the shadwe of every tree
  Was as in lengthe the same quantitee
  That was the body erect that caused it.
  And therfor by the shadwe he took his wit                     10
  That Phebus, which that shoon so clere and brighte,
  Degrees was fyve and fourty clombe on highte;
  And for that day, as in that latitude,
  It was ten of the clokke, he gan conclude,
  And sodeynly he plighte his hors aboute.                      15

    'Lordinges,' quod he, 'I warne yow, al this route,
  The fourthe party of this day is goon;
  Now, for the love of god and of seint Iohn,
  Leseth no tyme, as ferforth as ye may;
  Lordinges, the tyme wasteth night and day,                    20
  And steleth from us, what prively slepinge,
  And what thurgh necligence in our wakinge,
  As dooth the streem, that turneth never agayn,
  Descending fro the montaigne in-to playn.
  Wel can Senek, and many a philosophre                         25
  Biwailen tyme, more than gold in cofre.
  [131: T. 4447-4483.]
  "For los of catel may recovered be,
  But los of tyme shendeth us," quod he.
  It wol nat come agayn, with-outen drede,
  Na more than wol Malkins maydenhede,                          30
  Whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse;
  Lat us nat moulen thus in ydelnesse.
  Sir man of lawe,' quod he, 'so have ye blis,
  Tel us a tale anon, as forward is;
  Ye been submitted thurgh your free assent                     35
  To stonde in this cas at my Iugement.

  Biheste is dette, and I wol holde fayn
  Al my biheste; I can no better seyn.
  For swich lawe as man yeveth another wight,
  He sholde him-selven usen it by right;
  Thus wol our text; but natheles certeyn                       45
  I can right now no thrifty tale seyn,
  But Chaucer, though he can but lewedly
  On metres and on ryming craftily,
  Hath seyd hem in swich English as he can
  Of olde tyme, as knoweth many a man.                          50
  And if he have not seyd hem, leve brother,
  In o book, he hath seyd hem in another.
  For he hath told of loveres up and doun
  Mo than Ovyde made of mencioun
  In his Epistelles, that been ful olde.                        55
  What sholde I tellen hem, sin they ben tolde?
  In youthe he made of Ceys and Alcion,
  And sithen hath he spoke of everichon,
  Thise noble wyves and thise loveres eek.
  Who-so that wol his large volume seek                         60

  Of Brixseyde, and of thee, Ladomëa;
  The crueltee of thee, queen Medëa,

  For thy Iason, that was of love so fals!

  Or elles of Tyro Apollonius,
  How that the cursed king Antiochus
  Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,
  That is so horrible a tale for to rede,
  Whan he hir threw up-on the pavement.                         85
  And therfor he, of ful avysement,

  THE PROLOGE OF THE MANNES TALE OF LAWE.

  O hateful harm! condicion of poverte!
  With thurst, with cold, with hunger so confounded!           100
  To asken help thee shameth in thyn herte;
  If thou noon aske, with nede artow so wounded,
  That verray nede unwrappeth al thy wounde hid!
  Maugree thyn heed, thou most for indigence
  Or stele, or begge, or borwe thy despence!                   105
  Thou blamest Crist, and seyst ful bitterly,
  He misdeparteth richesse temporal;
  Thy neighebour thou wytest sinfully,                        (10)
  And seyst thou hast to lyte, and he hath al.
  'Parfay,' seistow, 'somtyme he rekne shal,                   110
  Whan that his tayl shal brennen in the glede,
  For he noght helpeth needfulle in hir nede.'
  Herkne what is the sentence of the wyse:--
  'Bet is to dyën than have indigence;'
  Thy selve neighebour wol thee despyse;                       115
  If thou be povre, farwel thy reverence!
  Yet of the wyse man tak this sentence:--
  'Alle the dayes of povre men ben wikke;'                    (20)
  Be war therfor, er thou come in that prikke!
  If thou be povre, thy brother hateth thee,                   120
  And alle thy freendes fleen fro thee, alas!
  O riche marchaunts, ful of wele ben ye,
  O noble, o prudent folk, as in this cas!
  Your bagges been nat filled with _ambes as_,
  But with _sis cink_, than renneth for your chaunce;          125
  At Cristemasse merie may ye daunce!
  Ye seken lond and see for your winninges,
  As wyse folk ye knowen al thestaat                          (30)
  Of regnes; ye ben fadres of tydinges
  And tales, bothe of pees and of debat.                       130

  Nere that a marchaunt, goon is many a yere,
  Me taughte a tale, which that ye shal here.

THE TALE OF THE MAN OF LAWE.

       *       *       *       *       *

  HERE BEGINNETH THE MAN OF LAWE HIS TALE.

  In Surrie whylom dwelte a companye
  Of chapmen riche, and therto sadde and trewe,                135
  That wyde-wher senten her spycerye,
  Clothes of gold, and satins riche of hewe;
  Her chaffar was so thrifty and so newe,                     (40)
  That every wight hath deyntee to chaffare
  With hem, and eek to sellen hem hir ware.                    140

  Now fel it, that the maistres of that sort
  Han shapen hem to Rome for to wende;
  Were it for chapmanhode or for disport,
  Nan other message wolde they thider sende,
  But comen hem-self to Rome, this is the ende;                145
  And in swich place, as thoughte hem avantage
  For her entente, they take her herbergage.

  Soiourned han thise marchants in that toun                  (50)
  A certein tyme, as fel to hir plesance.
  And so bifel, that thexcellent renoun                        150
  Of themperoures doghter, dame Custance,
  Reported was, with every circumstance,
  Un-to thise Surrien marchants in swich wyse,
  Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse.

    150. E. And; _rest_ But.   153. E. swich a wyse; _the rest omit_ a.

  This was the commune vois of every man--                     155
  'Our Emperour of Rome, god him see,
  A doghter hath that, sin the world bigan,
  To rekne as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,                   (60)
  Nas never swich another as is she;
  [135: T. 4580-4616.]
  I prey to god in honour hir sustene,                         160
  And wolde she were of al Europe the quene.

  In hir is heigh beautee, with-oute pryde,
  Yowthe, with-oute grenehede or folye;
  To alle hir werkes vertu is hir gyde,
  Humblesse hath slayn in hir al tirannye.                     165
  She is mirour of alle curteisye;
  Hir herte is verray chambre of holinesse,
  Hir hand, ministre of fredom for almesse.'                  (70)

  And al this vois was soth, as god is trewe,
  But now to purpos lat us turne agayn;                        170
  Thise marchants han doon fraught hir shippes newe,
  And, whan they han this blisful mayden seyn,
  Hoom to Surryë been they went ful fayn,
  And doon her nedes as they han don yore,
  And liven in wele; I can sey yow no more.                    175

  Now fel it, that thise marchants stode in grace
  Of him, that was the sowdan of Surrye;
  For whan they came from any strange place,                  (80)
  He wolde, of his benigne curteisye,
  Make hem good chere, and bisily espye                        180
  Tydings of sondry regnes, for to lere
  The wondres that they mighte seen or here.

  Amonges othere thinges, specially
  Thise marchants han him told of dame Custance,
  So gret noblesse in ernest, ceriously,                       185
  That this sowdan hath caught so gret plesance
  To han hir figure in his remembrance,
  That al his lust and al his bisy cure                       (90)
  Was for to love hir whyl his lyf may dure.

  Paraventure in thilke large book                             190
  Which that men clepe the heven, y-writen was
  With sterres, whan that he his birthe took,
  That he for love shulde han his deeth, allas!
  For in the sterres, clerer than is glas,
  Is writen, god wot, who-so coude it rede,                    195
  The deeth of every man, withouten drede.

  [136: T. 4617-4651.]
  In sterres, many a winter ther-biforn,
  Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles,                   (100)
  Of Pompey, Iulius, er they were born;
  The stryf of Thebes; and of Ercules,                         200
  Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates
  The deeth; but mennes wittes been so dulle,
  That no wight can wel rede it atte fulle.

  This sowdan for his privee conseil sente,
  And, shortly of this mater for to pace,                      205
  He hath to hem declared his entente,
  And seyde hem certein, 'but he mighte have grace
  To han Custance with-inne a litel space,                   (110)
  He nas but deed;' and charged hem, in hye,
  To shapen for his lyf som remedye.                           210

  Diverse men diverse thinges seyden;
  They argumenten, casten up and doun;
  Many a subtil resoun forth they leyden,
  They speken of magik and abusioun;
  But finally, as in conclusioun,                              215
  They can not seen in that non avantage,
  Ne in non other wey, save mariage.

    212. Hl. Cp. argumentes.

  Than sawe they ther-in swich difficultee                   (120)
  By wey of resoun, for to speke al playn,
  By-cause that ther was swich diversitee                      220
  Bitwene hir bothe lawes, that they sayn,
  They trowe 'that no cristen prince wolde fayn
  Wedden his child under oure lawes swete
  That us were taught by Mahoun our prophete.'

    220. Cm. _om._ that.

  And he answerde, 'rather than I lese                         225
  Custance, I wol be cristned doutelees;
  I mot ben hires, I may non other chese.
  I prey yow holde your arguments in pees;                   (130)
  Saveth my lyf, and beeth noght recchelees
  To geten hir that hath my lyf in cure;                       230
  For in this wo I may not longe endure.'

  [137: T. 4652-4686.]
  What nedeth gretter dilatacioun?
  I seye, by tretis and embassadrye,
  And by the popes mediacioun,
  And al the chirche, and al the chivalrye,                    235
  That, in destruccioun of Maumetrye,
  And in encrees of Cristes lawe dere,
  They ben acorded, so as ye shal here;                      (140)

  How that the sowdan and his baronage
  And alle his liges shulde y-cristned be,                     240
  And he shal han Custance in mariage,
  And certein gold, I noot what quantitee,
  And her-to founden suffisant seurtee;
  This same acord was sworn on eyther syde;
  Now, faire Custance, almighty god thee gyde!                 245

  Now wolde som men waiten, as I gesse,
  That I shulde tellen al the purveyance
  That themperour, of his grete noblesse,                    (150)
  Hath shapen for his doghter dame Custance.
  Wel may men knowe that so gret ordinance                     250
  May no man tellen in a litel clause
  As was arrayed for so heigh a cause.

    255. E. ynough; Hn. Cp. Hl. ynowe; Cm. Ln. Inowe.

  Bisshopes ben shapen with hir for to wende,
  Lordes, ladyes, knightes of renoun,
  And other folk y-nowe, this is the ende;                     255
  And notifyed is thurgh-out the toun
  That every wight, with gret devocioun,
  Shulde preyen Crist that he this mariage                   (160)
  Receyve in gree, and spede this viage.

  The day is comen of hir departinge,                          260
  I sey, the woful day fatal is come,
  That ther may be no lenger taryinge,
  But forthward they hem dressen, alle and some;
  Custance, that was with sorwe al overcome,
  Ful pale arist, and dresseth hir to wende;                   265
  For wel she seeth ther is non other ende.

  [138: T. 4687-4721.]
  Allas! what wonder is it though she wepte,
  That shal be sent to strange nacioun                       (170)
  Fro freendes, that so tendrely hir kepte,
  And to be bounden under subieccioun                          270
  Of oon, she knoweth not his condicioun.
  Housbondes been alle gode, and han ben yore,
  That knowen wyves, I dar say yow no more.

  'Fader,' she sayde, 'thy wrecched child Custance,
  Thy yonge doghter, fostred up so softe,                      275
  And ye, my moder, my soverayn plesance
  Over alle thing, out-taken Crist on-lofte,
  Custance, your child, hir recomandeth ofte                 (180)
  Un-to your grace, for I shal to Surryë,

  Thende of thy werk or of thy lustes blinde                 (830)
  Is compleyning, how many-oon may men finde
  That noght for werk som-tyme, but for thentente              930
  To doon this sinne, ben outher sleyn or shente!

  How may this wayke womman han this strengthe
  Hir to defende agayn this renegat?
  O Golias, unmesurable of lengthe,
  How mighte David make thee so mat,                           935
  So yong and of armure so desolat?
  How dorste he loke up-on thy dredful face?
  Wel may men seen, it nas but goddes grace!                 (840)

  Who yaf Iudith corage or hardinesse
  To sleen him, Olofernus, in his tente,                       940
  And to deliveren out of wrecchednesse
  The peple of god? I seye, for this entente,
  That, right as god spirit of vigour sente
  To hem, and saved hem out of meschance,
  So sente he might and vigour to Custance.                    945

    940. E. Oloferne; Hl. Olefernes; _the rest_ Olofernus, Olefernus, _or_

  Forth goth hir ship thurgh-out the narwe mouth
  Of Iubaltar and Septe, dryving ay,
  Som-tyme West, som-tyme North and South,                   (850)
  And som-tyme Est, ful many a wery day,
  Til Cristes moder (blessed be she ay!)                       950
  [158: T. 5371-5400.]
  Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse,
  To make an ende of al hir hevinesse.

    947. E. alway; _rest_ ay. (_The latter is better, but recurs in_ l.
    950.)   948. _All but_ Hl. _ins._ and _after_ West.

  Now lat us stinte of Custance but a throwe,
  And speke we of the Romain Emperour,
  That out of Surrie hath by lettres knowe                     955
  The slaughtre of cristen folk, and dishonour
  Don to his doghter by a fals traitour,
  I mene the cursed wikked sowdanesse,                       (860)
  That at the feste leet sleen both more and lesse.

  For which this emperour hath sent anoon                      960
  His senatour, with royal ordinance,
  And othere lordes, got wot, many oon,
  On Surriens to taken heigh vengeance.
  They brennen, sleen, and bringe hem to meschance
  Ful many a day; but shortly, this is thende,                 965
  Homward to Rome they shapen hem to wende.

  This senatour repaireth with victorie
  To Rome-ward, sayling ful royally,                         (870)
  And mette the ship dryving, as seith the storie,
  In which Custance sit ful pitously.                          970
  No-thing ne knew he what she was, ne why
  She was in swich array; ne she nil seye
  Of hir estaat, althogh she sholde deye.

    971. E. Cm. _om._ ne _before_ knew; _the rest have it_.   973. Hl.
    although; Pt. though that; _rest_ thogh, though, thow.

  He bringeth hir to Rome, and to his wyf
  He yaf hir, and hir yonge sone also;                         975
  And with the senatour she ladde her lyf.
  Thus can our lady bringen out of wo
  Woful Custance, and many another mo.                       (880)
  And longe tyme dwelled she in that place,
  In holy werkes ever, as was hir grace.                       980

  [159: T. 5401-5435.]
  The senatoures wyf hir aunte was,
  But for al that she knew hir never the more;
  I wol no lenger tarien in this cas,
  But to king Alla, which I spak of yore,
  That for his wyf wepeth and syketh sore,                     985
  I wol retourne, and lete I wol Custance
  Under the senatoures governance.

    985. E. _puts_ wepeth _after_ That.

  King Alla, which that hadde his moder slayn,               (890)
  Upon a day fil in swich repentance,
  That, if I shortly tellen shal and plain,                    990
  To Rome he comth, to receyven his penance;
  And putte him in the popes ordinance
  In heigh and low, and Iesu Crist bisoghte
  Foryeve his wikked werkes that he wroghte.

  The fame anon thurgh Rome toun is born,                      995
  How Alla king shal come in pilgrimage,
  By herbergeours that wenten him biforn;
  For which the senatour, as was usage,                      (900)
  Rood him ageyn, and many of his linage,
  As wel to shewen his heighe magnificence                    1000

  Greet chere dooth this noble senatour
  To king Alla, and he to him also;
  Everich of hem doth other greet honour;
  And so bifel that, in a day or two,                         1005
  This senatour is to king Alla go
  To feste, and shortly, if I shal nat lye,
  Custances sone wente in his companye.                      (910)

  Som men wolde seyn, at requeste of Custance,
  This senatour hath lad this child to feste;                 1010
  I may nat tellen every circumstance,
  Be as be may, ther was he at the leste.
  But soth is this, that, at his modres heste,
  Biforn Alla, during the metes space,
  The child stood, loking in the kinges face.                 1015

  [160: T. 5436-5470.]
  This Alla king hath of this child greet wonder,
  And to the senatour he seyde anon,
  'Whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?'           (920)
  'I noot,' quod he, 'by god, and by seint Iohn!
  A moder he hath, but fader hath he non                      1020
  That I of woot'--but shortly, in a stounde,
  He tolde Alla how that this child was founde.

  'But god wot,' quod this senatour also,
  'So vertuous a livere in my lyf,
  Ne saugh I never as she, ne herde of mo                     1025
  Of worldly wommen, mayden, nor of wyf;
  I dar wel seyn hir hadde lever a knyf
  Thurgh-out her breste, than been a womman wikke;           (930)
  Ther is no man coude bringe hir to that prikke.'

    1026. Hl. Cm. Ln. mayden; _rest_ mayde. Cm. nor; Hl. Ln. or; _rest_ ne.

  Now was this child as lyk un-to Custance                    1030
  As possible is a creature to be.
  This Alla hath the face in remembrance
  Of dame Custance, and ther-on mused he
  If that the childes moder were aught she
  That was his wyf, and prively he sighte,                    1035
  And spedde him fro the table that he mighte.

  'Parfay,' thoghte he, 'fantome is in myn heed!
  I oghte deme, of skilful Iugement,                         (940)
  That in the salte see my wyf is deed.'
  And afterward he made his argument--                        1040
  'What woot I, if that Crist have hider y-sent
  My wyf by see, as wel as he hir sente
  To my contree fro thennes that she wente?'

    1041. E. haue; _rest_ hath.   E. ysent; Cm. I-sent; _rest_ sent.

  And, after noon, hoom with the senatour
  Goth Alla, for to seen this wonder chaunce.                 1045
  This senatour dooth Alla greet honour,
  And hastifly he sente after Custaunce.
  But trusteth weel, hir liste nat to daunce                 (950)
  Whan that she wiste wherefor was that sonde.
  Unnethe up-on hir feet she mighte stonde.                   1050

    1047. E. Pt. hastifly; _rest_ hastily, hastely.

[161: T. 5471-5505.]

  When Alla saugh his wyf, faire he hir grette,
  And weep, that it was routhe for to see.
  For at the firste look he on hir sette
  He knew wel verraily that it was she.
  And she for sorwe as domb stant as a tree;                  1055
  So was hir herte shet in hir distresse
  Whan she remembred his unkindenesse.

  Twyës she swowned in his owne sighte;                      (960)
  He weep, and him excuseth pitously:--
  'Now god,' quod he, 'and alle his halwes brighte            1060
  So wisly on my soule as have mercy,
  That of your harm as giltelees am I
  As is Maurice my sone so lyk your face;
  Elles the feend me fecche out of this place!'

    1060. Hl. alle; _which the rest omit_.

  Long was the sobbing and the bitter peyne                   1065
  Er that hir woful hertes mighte cesse;
  Greet was the pitee for to here hem pleyne,
  Thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse.                (970)
  I prey yow al my labour to relesse;
  I may nat telle hir wo un-til tomorwe,                      1070
  I am so wery for to speke of sorwe.

  But fynally, when that the sooth is wist
  That Alla giltelees was of hir wo,
  I trowe an hundred tymes been they kist,
  And swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two                   1075
  That, save the Ioye that lasteth evermo,
  Ther is non lyk, that any creature
  Hath seyn or shal, whyl that the world may dure.           (980)

    1074. Hl. they ben.

  Tho preyde she hir housbond mekely,
  In relief of hir longe pitous pyne,                         1080
  That he wold preye hir fader specially
  That, of his magestee, he wolde enclyne
  To vouche-sauf som day with him to dyne;
  She preyde him eek, he sholde by no weye
  Un-to hir fader no word of hir seye.                        1085

    1084. E. wolde; _rest_ sholde.

[162: T. 5506-5540.]

  Som men wold seyn, how that the child Maurice
  Doth this message un-to this emperour;
  But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nyce                      (990)
  To him, that was of so sovereyn honour
  As he that is of cristen folk the flour,                    1090
  Sente any child, but it is bet to deme
  He wente him-self, and so it may wel seme.

  This emperour hath graunted gentilly
  To come to diner, as he him bisoghte;
  And wel rede I, he loked bisily                             1095
  Up-on this child, and on his doghter thoghte.
  Alla goth to his in, and, as him oghte,
  Arrayed for this feste in every wyse                      (1000)
  As ferforth as his conning may suffyse.

  The morwe cam, and Alla gan him dresse,                     1100
  And eek his wyf, this emperour to mete;
  And forth they ryde in Ioye and in gladnesse.
  And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete,
  She lighte doun, and falleth him to fete.
  'Fader,' quod she, 'your yonge child Custance               1105
  Is now ful clene out of your remembrance.

  I am your doghter Custance,' quod she,
  'That whylom ye han sent un-to Surrye.                    (1010)
  It am I, fader, that in the salte see
  Was put allone and dampned for to dye.                      1110
  Now, gode fader, mercy I yow crye,
  Send me namore un-to non hethenesse,
  But thonketh my lord heer of his kindenesse.'

    1107. _So in all the MSS.; to be read as_ Cústancë (_three syllables_).

  Who can the pitous Ioye tellen al
  Bitwix hem three, sin they ben thus y-mette?                1115
  But of my tale make an ende I shal;
  The day goth faste, I wol no lenger lette.
  This glade folk to diner they hem sette;                  (1020)
  In Ioye and blisse at mete I lete hem dwelle
  A thousand fold wel more than I can telle.                  1120

  [163: T. 5541-5573.]
  This child Maurice was sithen emperour
  Maad by the pope, and lived cristenly.
  To Cristes chirche he dide greet honour;
  But I lete al his storie passen by,
  Of Custance is my tale specially.                           1125

  Wher-as they live in Ioye and in quiete.
  But litel whyl it lasteth, I yow hete,

  Now lat us preyen god his soule blesse!

  Til deeth departed hem, this lyf they lede.               (1060)
  And fareth now weel, my tale is at an ende.
  Now Iesu Crist, that of his might may sende                 1160

  A marchant whylom dwelled at Seint Denys,

  A wyf he hadde of excellent beautee,
  And compaignable and revelous was she,
  Which is a thing that causeth more dispence                 1195
  Than worth is al the chere and reverence
  That men hem doon at festes and at daunces;
  Swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces
  Passen as dooth a shadwe up-on the wal.
  But wo is him that payen moot for al;                       1200
  The sely housbond, algate he mot paye;                      (11)
  He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,
  Al for his owene worship richely,
  In which array we daunce Iolily.
  And if that he noght may, par-aventure,                     1205
  Or elles, list no swich dispence endure,

  For his largesse, and for his wyf was fair,
  That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.
  Amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale,
  Ther was a monk, a fair man and a bold,                     1215
  I trowe of thritty winter he was old,
  That ever in oon was drawing to that place.

  Aqueinted was so with the gode man,

  Amonges cristen folk, a Iewerye,
  Sustened by a lord of that contree                          1680
  For foule usure and lucre of vilanye,
  Hateful to Crist and to his companye;                       (40)
  And thurgh the strete men mighte ryde or wende,
  For it was free, and open at either ende.

    HEADING. _From_ E. Hn. _has_--Here biggynneth the Prioresse tale of
    Alma redemptoris mater.

  A litel scole of cristen folk ther stood                    1685
  Doun at the ferther ende, in which ther were
  Children an heep, y-comen of cristen blood,
  That lerned in that scole yeer by yere
  Swich maner doctrine as men used there,
  This is to seyn, to singen and to rede,                     1690
  As smale children doon in hir childhede.

  [183: T. 13432-13466.]
  Among thise children was a widwes sone,                     (50)
  A litel clergeon, seven yeer of age,
  That day by day to scole was his wone,
  And eek also, wher-as he saugh thimage                      1695
  Of Cristes moder, hadde he in usage,
  As him was taught, to knele adoun and seye
  His _Ave Marie_, as he goth by the weye.

  Thus hath this widwe hir litel sone y-taught
  Our blisful lady, Cristes moder dere,                       1700
  To worshipe ay, and he forgat it naught,
  For sely child wol alday sone lere;                         (60)
  But ay, whan I remembre on this matere,
  Seint Nicholas stant ever in my presence,
  For he so yong to Crist did reverence.                      1705

  This litel child, his litel book lerninge,
  As he sat in the scole at his prymer,
  He _Alma redemptoris_ herde singe,
  As children lerned hir antiphoner;
  And, as he dorste, he drough him ner and ner,               1710
  And herkned ay the wordes and the note,
  Til he the firste vers coude al by rote.                    (70)

  Noght wiste he what this Latin was to seye,
  For he so yong and tendre was of age;
  But on a day his felaw gan he preye                         1715
  Texpounden him this song in his langage,
  Or telle him why this song was in usage;
  This preyde he him to construe and declare
  Ful ofte tyme upon his knowes bare.

    1719. E. Hl. often.

  His felaw, which that elder was than he,                    1720
  Answerde him thus: 'this song, I have herd seye,
  Was maked of our blisful lady free,                         (80)
  Hir to salue, and eek hir for to preye
  To been our help and socour whan we deye.
  I can no more expounde in this matere;                      1725
  I lerne song, I can but smal grammere.'

[184: T. 13467-13501.]

  'And is this song maked in reverence
  Of Cristes moder?' seyde this innocent;
  'Now certes, I wol do my diligence
  To conne it al, er Cristemasse is went;                     1730
  Though that I for my prymer shal be shent,
  And shal be beten thryës in an houre,                       (90)
  I wol it conne, our lady for to honoure.'

  His felaw taughte him homward prively,
  Fro day to day, til he coude it by rote,                    1735
  And than he song it wel and boldely
  Fro word to word, acording with the note;
  Twyës a day it passed thurgh his throte,
  To scoleward and homward whan he wente;
  On Cristes moder set was his entente.                       1740

  Ful merily than wolde he singe, and crye
  _O Alma redemptoris_ ever-mo.
  The swetnes hath his herte perced so                        1745

  HERE BIGINNETH CHAUCERS TALE OF THOPAS.

  Listeth, lordes, in good entent,
  And I wol telle verrayment
    Of mirthe and of solas;
  Al of a knyght was fair and gent                            1905
  In bataille and in tourneyment,
    His name was sir Thopas.

    HEADING. _From_ E. (E. Heere).

  Y-born he was in fer contree,
  In Flaundres, al biyonde the see,
    At Popering, in the place;                                1910
  His fader was a man ful free,                               (10)
  And lord he was of that contree,
    As it was goddes grace.

  Sir Thopas wex a doghty swayn,
  Whyt was his face as payndemayn,                            1915
    His lippes rede as rose;
  His rode is lyk scarlet in grayn,
  And I yow telle in good certayn,
    He hadde a semely nose.

  His heer, his berd was lyk saffroun,                        1920
  That to his girdel raughte adoun;                           (20)
    His shoon of Cordewane.
  Of Brugges were his hosen broun,
  His robe was of ciclatoun,

    With grey goshauk on honde;
  Ther-to be was a good archeer,
  Of wrastling was ther noon his peer,                        1930

  And sweet as is the bremble-flour
    That bereth the rede hepe.

  And so bifel up-on a day,
  For sothe, as I yow telle may,
    Sir Thopas wolde out ryde;                                1940

  So swatte that men mighte him wringe,
    His sydes were al blood.

  Sir Thopas eek so wery was
  For prikinge on the softe gras,
    So fiers was his corage,                                  1970
  That doun he leyde him in that plas                         (70)
  To make his stede som solas,
    And yaf him good forage.

HERE BIGINNETH CHAUCERS TALE OF MELIBEE.

§ 1. A yong man called Melibeus, mighty and riche, bigat up-on his wyf that
called was Prudence, a doghter which that called was Sophie. /

    HEADING. _From_ E.

§ 2. Upon a day bifel, that he for his desport is went in-to the feeldes
him to pleye. / His wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous,
of which the dores weren fast y-shette. / Thre of his olde foos han it
espyed, and setten laddres to the walles of his hous, and by the windowes
been entred, /2160 and betten his wyf, and wounded his doghter with fyve
mortal woundes in fyve sondry places; / this is to seyn, in hir feet, in
hir handes, in hir eres, in hir nose, and in hir mouth; and leften hir for
deed, and wenten awey. /

    E. foes; Hn. Cp. Ln. Hl. foos.   by the] E. Hn. _om._ the.   2162. E.
    erys.

§ 3. Whan Melibeus retourned was in-to his hous, and saugh al this
meschief, he, lyk a mad man, rendinge his clothes, gan to wepe and crye. /

    2163. E. Hn. Ln. rentynge; _rest_ rendyng.

§ 4. Prudence his wyf, as ferforth as she dorste, bisoghte him of his
weping for to stinte; / but nat for-thy he gan to crye and wepen ever
lenger the more. /2165

§ 5. This noble wyf Prudence remembered hir upon the sentence of Ovide, in
his book that cleped is The Remedie of Love, wher-as he seith; / 'he is a
fool that destourbeth the moder to wepen in the deeth of hir child, til she
have wept hir fille, as for a certain tyme; / and thanne shal man doon his
diligence with amiable wordes hir to reconforte, and preyen hir of hir
weping for to stinte.' / For which resoun this noble wyf Prudence suffred
hir housbond for to wepe and crye as for a certein space; / and whan she
saugh hir tyme, she seyde him in this wyse. 'Allas, my lord,' quod she,'
why make ye your-self for to be lyk a fool? /2170 For [200] sothe, it
aperteneth nat to a wys man, to maken swiche a sorwe. / Your doghter, with
the grace of god, shal warisshe and escape. / And al were it so that she
right now were deed, ye ne oghte nat as for hir deeth your-self to
destroye. / Senek seith: "the wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort
for the deeth of his children, / but certes he sholde suffren it in
pacience, as wel as he abydeth the deeth of his owene propre persone."'
/2175

    2172. Cp. Ln. be warisshed; Hl. warischt be.   2173. _Only_ E. Cp. Ln.
    _insert_ to _before_ destroye.

§ 6. This Melibeus answerde anon and seyde, 'What man,' quod he, 'sholde of
his weping stinte, that hath so greet a cause for to wepe? / Iesu Crist,
our lord, him-self wepte for the deeth of Lazarus his freend.' / Prudence
answerde, 'Certes, wel I woot, attempree weping is no-thing defended to him
that sorweful is, amonges folk in sorwe, but it is rather graunted him to
wepe. / The Apostle Paul un-to the Romayns wryteth, "man shal reioyse with
hem that maken Ioye, and wepen with swich folk as wepen." / But thogh
attempree weping be y-graunted, outrageous weping certes is defended. /2180
Mesure of weping sholde be considered, after the lore that techeth us
Senek. / "Whan that thy freend is deed," quod he, "lat nat thyne eyen to
moyste been of teres, ne to muche drye; althogh the teres come to thyne
eyen, lat hem nat falle." / And whan thou hast for-goon thy freend, do
diligence to gete another freend; and this is more wysdom than for to wepe
for thy freend which that thou hast lorn; for ther-inne is no bote. / And
therfore, if ye governe yow by sapience, put awey sorwe out of your herte.
/ Remembre yow that Iesus Syrak seith: "a man that is Ioyous and glad in
herte, it him conserveth florisshing in his age; but soothly sorweful herte
maketh his bones drye." /2185 He seith eek thus: "that sorwe in herte
sleeth ful many a man." / Salomon seith: "that, right as motthes in the
shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes, and the smale wormes to the tree,
right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte." / Wherfore us oghte, as wel in the
deeth of our children as in the losse of our goodes temporels, have
pacience. /

§ 7. Remembre yow up-on the pacient Iob, whan he hadde lost his children
and his temporel substance, and in his body [201] endured and receyved ful
many a grevous tribulacioun; yet seyde he thus: / "our lord hath yeven it
me, our lord hath biraft it me; right as our lord hath wold, right so it is
doon; blessed be the name of our lord."' /2190 To thise foreseide thinges
answerde Melibeus un-to his wyf Prudence: 'Alle thy wordes,' quod he, 'been
sothe, and ther-to profitable; but trewely myn herte is troubled with this
sorwe so grevously, that I noot what to done.' / 'Lat calle,' quod
Prudence, 'thy trewe freendes alle, and thy linage whiche that been wyse;
telleth your cas, and herkneth what they seye in conseiling, and yow
governe after hir sentence. / Salomon seith: "werk alle thy thinges by
conseil, and thou shalt never repente."' /

    _repeat_ our lord.   2191. E. therwith; _rest_ ther-to.

§ 8. Thanne, by the conseil of his wyf Prudence, this Melibeus leet callen
a greet congregacioun of folk; / as surgiens, phisiciens, olde folk and
yonge, and somme of hise olde enemys reconsiled as by hir semblaunt to his
love and in-to his grace; /2195 and ther-with-al ther comen somme of hise
neighebores that diden him reverence more for drede than for love, as it
happeth ofte. / Ther comen also ful many subtile flatereres, and wyse
advocats lerned in the lawe. /

    2196, 7. E. coomen.

§ 9. And whan this folk togidre assembled weren, this Melibeus in sorweful
wyse shewed hem his cas; / and by the manere of his speche it semed that in
herte he bar a cruel ire, redy to doon vengeaunce up-on hise foos, and
sodeynly desired that the werre sholde biginne; / but nathelees yet axed he
hir conseil upon this matere. /2200 A surgien, by licence and assent of
swiche as weren wyse, up roos and un-to Melibeus seyde as ye may here. /

§ 10. 'Sir,' quod he, 'as to us surgiens aperteneth, that we do to every
wight the beste that we can, wher-as we been with-holde, and to our
pacients that we do no damage; / wherfore it happeth, many tyme and ofte,
that whan twey men han everich wounded other, oon same surgien heleth hem
bothe; / wherefore un-to our art it is nat pertinent to norice werre, ne
parties to supporte. / But certes, as to the warisshinge of your doghter,
al-be-it so that she perilously be wounded, we shullen do so ententif
bisinesse fro day to night, that with the grace of god she shal be hool and
[202] sound as sone as is possible.' /2205 Almost right in the same wyse
the phisiciens answerden, save that they seyden a fewe wordes more: /
'That, right as maladyes been cured by hir contraries, right so shul men
warisshe werre by vengeaunce.' / His neighebores, ful of envye, his feyned
freendes that semeden reconsiled, and his flatereres, / maden semblant of
weping, and empeireden and agreggeden muchel of this matere, in preising
greetly Melibee of might, of power, of richesse, and of freendes,
despysinge the power of his adversaries, / and seiden outrely that he anon
sholde wreken him on his foos and biginne werre. /2210

    2209. E. matiere.   2210. E. foes.

§ 11. Up roos thanne an advocat that was wys, by leve and by conseil of
othere that were wyse, and seyde: / 'Lordinges, the nede for which we been
assembled in this place is a ful hevy thing and an heigh matere, / by-cause
of the wrong and of the wikkednesse that hath be doon, and eek by resoun of
the grete damages that in tyme cominge been possible to fallen for this
same cause; / and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the
parties bothe; / for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet peril to erren
in this matere. /2215 Wherfore, Melibeus, this is our sentence: we
conseille yow aboven alle thing, that right anon thou do thy diligence in
kepinge of thy propre persone, in swich a wyse that thou ne wante noon
espye ne wacche, thy body for to save. / And after that we conseille, that
in thyn hous thou sette suffisant garnisoun, so that they may as wel thy
body as thyn hous defende. / But certes, for to moeve werre, or sodeynly
for to doon vengeaunce, we may nat demen in so litel tyme that it were
profitable. / Wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have deliberacioun in
this cas to deme. / For the commune proverbe seith thus: "he that sone
demeth, sone shal repente." /2220 And eek men seyn that thilke Iuge is wys,
that sone understondeth a matere and Iuggeth by leyser. / For al-be-it so
that alle tarying be anoyful, algates it is nat to repreve in yevynge of
Iugement, ne in vengeance-taking, whan it is suffisant and resonable. / And
that shewed our lord Iesu Crist by ensample; for whan that the womman that
was taken in avoutrie was broght in his presence, to knowen what sholde be
doon with hir persone, al-be-it so that he wiste wel him-self what that he
[203] wolde answere, yet ne wolde he nat answere sodeynly, but he wolde
have deliberacioun, and in the ground he wroot twyes. / And by thise causes
we axen deliberacioun, and we shal thanne, by the grace of god, conseille
thee thing that shal be profitable.' /

§ 12. Up stirten thanne the yonge folk at-ones, and the moste partie of
that companye han scorned the olde wyse men, and bigonnen to make noyse,
and seyden: that, /2225 right so as whyl that iren is hoot, men sholden
smyte, right so, men sholde wreken hir wronges whyle that they been fresshe
and newe; and with loud voys they cryden, 'werre! werre!' /

    2225. E. _om._ han.

Up roos tho oon of thise olde wyse, and with his hand made contenaunce that
men sholde holden hem stille and yeven him audience. / 'Lordinges,' quod
he, 'ther is ful many a man that cryeth "werre! werre!" that woot ful litel
what werre amounteth. / Werre at his biginning hath so greet an entree and
so large, that every wight may entre whan him lyketh, and lightly finde
werre. / But, certes, what ende that shal ther-of bifalle, it is nat light
to knowe. /2230 For sothly, whan that werre is ones bigonne, ther is ful
many a child unborn of his moder, that shal sterve yong by-cause of that
ilke werre, or elles live in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse. / And
ther-fore, er that any werre biginne, men moste have greet conseil and
greet deliberacioun.' / And whan this olde man wende to enforcen his tale
by resons, wel ny alle at-ones bigonne they to ryse for to breken his tale,
and beden him ful ofte his wordes for to abregge. / For soothly, he that
precheth to hem that listen nat heren his wordes, his sermon hem anoyeth. /
For Iesus Syrak seith: that "musik in wepinge is anoyous thing;" this is to
seyn: as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to whiche his speche
anoyeth, as dooth to singe biforn him that wepeth. /2235 And whan this wyse
man saugh that him wanted audience, al shamefast he sette him doun agayn. /
For Salomon seith: "ther-as thou ne mayst have noon audience, enforce thee
nat to speke." / 'I see wel,' quod this wyse man, 'that the commune
proverbe is sooth; that "good conseil wanteth whan it is most nede."' /

§ 13. Yet hadde this Melibeus in his conseil many folk, that [204] prively
in his ere conseilled him certeyn thing, and conseilled him the contrarie
in general audience. /

Whan Melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren
accorded that he sholde maken werre, anoon he consented to hir conseilling,
and fully affermed hir sentence. /2240 Thanne dame Prudence, whan that she
saugh how that hir housbonde shoop him for to wreken him on his foos, and
to biginne werre, she in ful humble wyse, when she saugh hir tyme, seide
him thise wordes: / 'My lord,' quod she, 'I yow biseche as hertely as I dar
and can, ne haste yow nat to faste, and for alle guerdons as yeveth me
audience. / For Piers Alfonce seith: "who-so that dooth to that other good
or harm, haste thee nat to quyten it; for in this wyse thy freend wol
abyde, and thyn enemy shal the lenger live in drede." / The proverbe seith:
"he hasteth wel that wysely can abyde;" and in wikked haste is no profit.'

§ 14. This Melibee answerde un-to his wyf Prudence: 'I purpose nat,' quod
he, 'to werke by thy conseil, for many causes and resouns. For certes every
wight wolde holde me thanne a fool; /2245 this is to seyn, if I, for thy
conseilling, wolde chaungen thinges that been ordeyned and affermed by so
manye wyse. / Secoundly I seye, that alle wommen been wikke and noon good
of hem alle. For "of a thousand men," seith Salomon, "I fond a good man:
but certes, of alle wommen, good womman fond I never." / And also certes,
if I governed me by thy conseil, it sholde seme that I hadde yeve to thee
over me the maistrie; and god forbede that it so were. / For Iesus Syrak
seith; "that if the wyf have maistrie, she is contrarious to hir
housbonde." / And Salomon seith: "never in thy lyf, to thy wyf, ne to thy
child, ne to thy freend, ne yeve no power over thy-self. For bettre it were
that thy children aske of thy persone thinges that hem nedeth, than thou
see thy-self in the handes of thy children." /2250 And also, if I wolde
werke by thy conseilling, certes my conseilling moste som tyme be secree,
til it were tyme that it moste be knowe; and this ne may noght be. / [For
it is writen, that "the Ianglerie of wommen can hyden thinges that they
witen noght." / [205] Furthermore, the philosophre seith, "in wikked
conseil wommen venquisshe men;" and for thise resouns I ne owe nat usen thy
conseil.'] /

§ 15. Whanne dame Prudence, ful debonairly and with greet pacience, hadde
herd al that hir housbonde lyked for to seye, thanne axed she of him
licence for to speke, and seyde in this wyse. / 'My lord,' quod she, 'as to
your firste resoun, certes it may lightly been answered. For I seye, that
it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the thing is chaunged; or elles whan
the thing semeth otherweyes than it was biforn. /2255 And more-over I seye,
that though ye han sworn and bihight to perfourne your emprise, and
nathelees ye weyve to perfourne thilke same emprise by Iuste cause, men
sholde nat seyn therefore that ye were a lyer ne forsworn. / For the book
seith, that "the wyse man maketh no lesing whan he turneth his corage to
the bettre." / And al-be-it so that your emprise be establissed and
ordeyned by greet multitude of folk, yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke same
ordinaunce but yow lyke. / For the trouthe of thinges and the profit been
rather founden in fewe folk that been wyse and ful of resoun, than by greet
multitude of folk, ther every man cryeth and clatereth what that him
lyketh. Soothly swich multitude is nat honeste. / As to the seconde resoun,
where-as ye seyn that "alle wommen been wikke," save your grace, certes ye
despysen alle wommen in this wyse; and "he that alle despyseth alle
displeseth," as seith the book. /2260 And Senek seith that "who-so wole
have sapience, shal no man dispreise; but he shal gladly techen the science
that he can, with-outen presumpcioun or pryde. / And swiche thinges as he
nought ne can, he shal nat been ashamed to lerne hem and enquere of lasse
folk than him-self." / And sir, that ther hath been many a good womman, may
lightly be preved. / For certes, sir, our lord Iesu Crist wolde never have
descended to be born of a womman, if alle wommen hadden ben wikke. / And
after that, for the grete bountee that is in wommen, our lord Iesu Crist,
whan he was risen fro deeth to lyve, appeered rather to a womman than to
his apostles. /2265 And though that Salomon seith, that "he ne fond never
womman good," it folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben wikke. / For
though that he ne fond no good [206] womman, certes, ful many another man
hath founden many a womman ful good and trewe. / Or elles per-aventure the
entente of Salomon was this; that, as in sovereyn bountee, he fond no
womman; / this is to seyn, that ther is no wight that hath sovereyn bountee
save god allone; as he him-self recordeth in his Evaungelie. / For ther nis
no creature so good that him ne wanteth somwhat of the perfeccioun of god,
that is his maker. /2270 Your thridde resoun is this: ye seyn that "if ye
governe yow by my conseil, it sholde seme that ye hadde yeve me the
maistrie and the lordshipe over your persone." / Sir, save your grace, it
is nat so. For if it were so, that no man sholde be conseilled but only of
hem that hadden lordshipe and maistrie of his persone, men wolden nat be
conseilled so ofte. / For soothly, thilke man that asketh conseil of a
purpos, yet hath he free chois, wheither he wole werke by that conseil or
noon. / And as to your fourthe resoun, ther ye seyn that "the Ianglerie of
wommen hath hid thinges that they woot noght," as who seith, that "a womman
can nat hyde that she woot;" / sir, thise wordes been understonde of wommen
that been Iangleresses and wikked; /2275 of whiche wommen, men seyn that
"three thinges dryven a man out of his hous; that is to seyn, smoke,
dropping of reyn, and wikked wyves;" / and of swiche wommen seith Salomon,
that "it were bettre dwelle in desert, than with a womman that is riotous."
/ And sir, by your leve, that am nat I; / for ye han ful ofte assayed my
grete silence and my gret pacience; and eek how wel that I can hyde and
hele thinges that men oghte secreely to hyde. / And soothly, as to your
fifthe resoun, wher-as ye seyn, that "in wikked conseil wommen venquisshe
men;" god woot, thilke resoun stant here in no stede. /2280 For understand
now, ye asken conseil to do wikkednesse; / and if ye wole werken
wikkednesse, and your wyf restreyneth thilke wikked purpos, and overcometh
yow by resoun and by good conseil; / certes, your wyf oghte rather to be
preised than y-blamed. / Thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre that
seith, "in wikked conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes." / And ther-as
ye blamen alle wommen and hir resouns, I shal shewe yow by manye ensamples
that many a womman hath ben ful good, and yet been; and hir conseils ful
hoolsome and profitable. /2285 Eek som men han seyd, that "the [207]
conseillinge of wommen is outher to dere, or elles to litel of prys." / But
al-be-it so, that ful many a womman is badde, and hir conseil vile and
noght worth, yet han men founde ful many a good womman, and ful discrete
and wise in conseillinge. / Lo, Iacob, by good conseil of his moder
Rebekka, wan the benisoun of Ysaak his fader, and the lordshipe over alle
his bretheren. / Iudith, by hir good conseil, delivered the citee of
Bethulie, in which she dwelled, out of the handes of Olofernus, that hadde
it biseged and wolde have al destroyed it. / Abigail delivered Nabal hir
housbonde fro David the king, that wolde have slayn him, and apaysed the
ire of the king by hir wit and by hir good conseilling. /2290 Hester by hir
good conseil enhaunced greetly the peple of god in the regne of Assuerus
the king. / And the same bountee in good conseilling of many a good womman
may men telle. / And moreover, whan our lord hadde creat Adam our
forme-fader, he seyde in this wyse: / "it is nat good to been a man allone;
make we to him an help semblable to himself." / Here may ye se that, if
that wommen were nat goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable, /2295
our lord god of hevene wolde never han wroght hem, ne called hem help of
man, but rather confusioun of man. / And ther seyde ones a clerk in two
vers: "what is bettre than gold? Iaspre. What is bettre than Iaspre?
Wisdom. / And what is bettre than wisdom? Womman. And what is bettre than a
good womman? No-thing." / And sir, by manye of othre resons may ye seen,
that manye wommen been goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable. / And
therfore sir, if ye wol triste to my conseil, I shal restore yow your
doghter hool and sound. /2300 And eek I wol do to yow so muche, that ye
shul have honour in this cause.' /

§ 16. Whan Melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf Prudence, he seyde
thus: / 'I se wel that the word of Salomon is sooth; he seith, that "wordes
that been spoken discreetly by ordinaunce, been honycombes; for they yeven
swetnesse to the soule, and hoolsomnesse to the body." / And wyf, by-cause
of thy swete wordes, and eek for I have assayed and preved thy grete
sapience and thy grete trouthe, I wol governe me by thy conseil in alle
thing.' /

§ 17. 'Now sir,' quod dame Prudence, 'and sin ye vouche-sauf [208] to been
governed by my conseil, I wol enforme yow how ye shul governe your-self in
chesinge of your conseillours. /2305 Ye shul first, in alle your werkes,
mekely biseken to the heighe god that he wol be your conseillour; / and
shapeth yow to swich entente, that he yeve yow conseil and confort, as
taughte Thobie his sone. / "At alle tymes thou shalt blesse god, and praye
him to dresse thy weyes"; and looke that alle thy conseils been in him for
evermore. / Seint Iame eek seith: "if any of yow have nede of sapience, axe
it of god." / And afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in your-self, and
examine wel your thoghtes, of swich thing as yow thinketh that is best for
your profit. /2310 And thanne shul ye dryve fro your herte three thinges
that been contrariouse to good conseil, / that is to seyn, ire, coveitise,
and hastifnesse. /

    2310. in] E. of.   E. _om._ self.

§ 18. First, he that axeth conseil of him-self, certes he moste been
with-outen ire, for manye causes. / The firste is this: he that hath greet
ire and wratthe in him-self, he weneth alwey that he may do thing that he
may nat do. / And secoundely, he that is irous and wroth, he ne may nat wel
deme; /2315 and he that may nat wel deme, may nat wel conseille. / The
thridde is this; that "he that is irous and wrooth," as seith Senek, "ne
may nat speke but he blame thinges;" / and with his viciouse wordes he
stireth other folk to angre and to ire. / And eek sir, ye moste dryve
coveitise out of your herte. / For the apostle seith, that "coveitise is
rote of alle harmes." /2320 And trust wel that a coveitous man ne can noght
deme ne thinke, but only to fulfille the ende of his coveitise; / and
certes, that ne may never been accompliced; for ever the more habundaunce
that he hath of richesse, the more he desyreth. / And sir, ye moste also
dryve out of your herte hastifnesse; for certes, / ye ne may nat deme for
the beste a sodeyn thought that falleth in youre herte, but ye moste avyse
yow on it ful ofte. / For as ye herde biforn, the commune proverbe is this,
that "he that sone demeth, sone repenteth." /2325

§ 19. Sir, ye ne be nat alwey in lyke disposicioun; / for certes, som thing
that somtyme semeth to yow that it is good for to do, another tyme it
semeth to yow the contrarie. /

§ 20. Whan ye han taken conseil in your-self, and han demed by good
deliberacion swich thing as you semeth best, / thanne rede I yow, that ye
kepe it secree. / Biwrey nat your conseil to no persone, [209] but-if so be
that ye wenen sikerly that, thurgh your biwreying, your condicioun shal be
to yow the more profitable. /2330 For Iesus Syrak seith: "neither to thy
foo ne to thy freend discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie; / for they wol
yeve yow audience and loking and supportacioun in thy presence, and scorne
thee in thyn absence." / Another clerk seith, that "scarsly shaltou finden
any persone that may kepe conseil secreely." / The book seith: "whyl that
thou kepest thy conseil in thyn herte, thou kepest it in thy prisoun: / and
whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any wight, he holdeth thee in his
snare." /2335 And therefore yow is bettre to hyde your conseil in your
herte, than praye him, to whom ye han biwreyed your conseil, that he wole
kepen it cloos and stille. / For Seneca seith: "if so be that thou ne mayst
nat thyn owene conseil hyde, how darstou prayen any other wight thy conseil
secreely to kepe?" / But nathelees, if thou wene sikerly that the biwreying
of thy conseil to a persone wol make thy condicioun to stonden in the
bettre plyt, thanne shaltou tellen him thy conseil in this wyse. / First,
thou shalt make no semblant whether thee were lever pees or werre, or this
or that, ne shewe him nat thy wille and thyn entente; / for trust wel, that
comunly thise conseillours been flatereres, /2340 namely the conseillours
of grete lordes; / for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken plesante
wordes, enclyninge to the lordes lust, than wordes that been trewe or
profitable. / And therfore men seyn, that "the riche man hath seld good
conseil but-if he have it of him-self." / And after that, thou shalt
considere thy freendes and thyne enemys. / And as touchinge thy freendes,
thou shalt considere whiche of hem been most feithful and most wyse, and
eldest and most approved in conseilling. /2345 And of hem shalt thou aske
thy conseil, as the caas requireth. /

§ 21. I seye that first ye shul clepe to your conseil your freendes that
been trewe. / For Salomon seith: that "right as the herte of a man delyteth
in savour that is sote, right so the conseil of trewe freendes yeveth
swetenesse to the soule." / He seith also: "ther may no-thing be lykned to
the trewe freend." / For certes, gold ne silver beth nat so muche worth as
the gode wil of a trewe freend. /2350 And eek he seith, that "a trewe
freend is a strong deffense; who-so that it findeth, certes he findeth a
greet tresour." / Thanne [210] shul ye eek considere, if that your trewe
freendes been discrete and wyse. For the book seith: "axe alwey thy conseil
of hem that been wyse." / And by this same resoun shul ye clepen to your
conseil, of your freendes that been of age, swiche as han seyn and been
expert in manye thinges, and been approved in conseillinges. / For the book
seith, that "in olde men is the sapience and in longe tyme the prudence." /
And Tullius seith: that "grete thinges ne been nat ay accompliced by
strengthe, ne by delivernesse of body, but by good conseil, by auctoritee
of persones, and by science; the whiche three thinges ne been nat feble by
age, but certes they enforcen and encreesen day by day." /2355 And thanne
shul ye kepe this for a general reule. First shul ye clepen to your conseil
a fewe of your freendes that been especiale; / for Salomon seith: "manye
freendes have thou; but among a thousand chese thee oon to be thy
conseillour." / For al-be-it so that thou first ne telle thy conseil but to
a fewe, thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk, if it be nede. / But loke
alwey that thy conseillours have thilke three condiciouns that I have seyd
bifore; that is to seyn, that they be trewe, wyse, and of old experience. /
And werke nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone; for somtyme
bihoveth it to been conseilled by manye. /2360 For Salomon seith:
"salvacioun of thinges is wher-as ther been manye conseillours." /

§ 22. Now sith that I have told yow of which folk ye sholde been
counseilled, now wol I teche yow which conseil ye oghte to eschewe. / First
ye shul eschewe the conseilling of foles; for Salomon seith: "taak no
conseil of a fool, for he ne can noght conseille but after his owene lust
and his affeccioun." / The book seith: that "the propretee of a fool is
this; he troweth lightly harm of every wight, and lightly troweth alle
bountee in him-self." / Thou shalt eek eschewe the conseilling of alle
flatereres, swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise your persone by
flaterye than for to telle yow the sothfastnesse of thinges. /2365

    2362. Hn. Cm. Hl. that; Pt. what; _rest om._   2365. E. _om._ alle.

§ 23. 'Wherfore Tullius seith: "amonges alle the pestilences that been in
freendshipe, the gretteste is flaterye." And therfore is it more nede that
thou eschewe and drede flatereres than any other peple. / The book seith:
"thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the swete wordes of flateringe
preiseres, than fro the egre [211] wordes of thy freend that seith thee thy
sothes." / Salomon seith, that "the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to
cacche with innocents." / He seith also, that "he that speketh to his
freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce, setteth a net biforn his feet
to cacche him." / And therfore seith Tullius: "enclyne nat thyne eres to
flatereres, ne taketh no conseil of wordes of flaterye." /2370 And Caton
seith: "avyse thee wel, and eschewe the wordes of swetnesse and of
plesaunce." / And eek thou shalt eschewe the conseilling of thyne olde
enemys that been reconsiled. / The book seith: that "no wight retourneth
saufly in-to the grace of his olde enemy." / And Isope seith: "ne trust nat
to hem to whiche thou hast had som-tyme werre or enmitee, ne telle hem nat
thy conseil." / And Seneca telleth the cause why. "It may nat be," seith
he, "that, where greet fyr hath longe tyme endured, that ther ne dwelleth
som vapour of warmnesse." /2375 And therfore seith Salomon: "in thyn olde
foo trust never." / For sikerly, though thyn enemy be reconsiled and maketh
thee chere of humilitee, and louteth to thee with his heed, ne trust him
never. / For certes, he maketh thilke feyned humilitee more for his profit
than for any love of thy persone; by-cause that he demeth to have victorie
over thy persone by swich feyned contenance, the which victorie he mighte
nat have by stryf or werre. / And Peter Alfonce seith: "make no felawshipe
with thyne olde enemys; for if thou do hem bountee, they wol perverten it
in-to wikkednesse." / And eek thou most eschewe the conseilling of hem that
been thy servants, and beren thee greet reverence; for peraventure they
seyn it more for drede than for love. /2380 And therfore seith a
philosophre in this wyse: "ther is no wight parfitly trewe to him that he
to sore dredeth." / And Tullius seith: "ther nis no might so greet of any
emperour, that longe may endure, but-if he have more love of the peple than
drede." / Thou shalt also eschewe the conseiling of folk that been
dronkelewe; for they ne can no conseil hyde. / For Salomon seith: "ther is
no privetee ther-as regneth dronkenesse." / Ye shul also han in suspect the
conseilling of swich folk as conseille yow a thing prively, and conseille
yow the contrarie openly. /2385 For [212] Cassidorie seith: that "it is a
maner sleighte to hindre, whan he sheweth to doon a thing openly and
werketh prively the contrarie." / Thou shalt also have in suspect the
conseilling of wikked folk. For the book seith: "the conseilling of wikked
folk is alwey ful of fraude:" / And David seith: "blisful is that man that
hath nat folwed the conseilling of shrewes." / Thou shalt also eschewe the
conseilling of yong folk; for hir conseil is nat rype. /

§ 24. Now sir, sith I have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take your
conseil, and of which folk ye shul folwe the conseil, /2390 now wol I teche
yow how ye shal examine your conseil, after the doctrine of Tullius. / In
the examininge thanne of your conseillour, ye shul considere manye thinges.
/ Alderfirst thou shalt considere, that in thilke thing that thou
purposest, and upon what thing thou wolt have conseil, that verray trouthe
be seyd and conserved; this is to seyn, telle trewely thy tale. / For he
that seith fals may nat wel be conseilled, in that cas of which he lyeth. /
And after this, thou shalt considere the thinges that acorden to that thou
purposest for to do by thy conseillours, if resoun accorde therto; /2395
and eek, if thy might may atteine ther-to; and if the more part and the
bettre part of thy conseillours acorde ther-to, or no. / Thanne shaltou
considere what thing shal folwe of that conseilling; as hate, pees, werre,
grace, profit, or damage; and manye othere thinges. / And in alle thise
thinges thou shalt chese the beste, and weyve alle othere thinges. / Thanne
shaltow considere of what rote is engendred the matere of thy conseil, and
what fruit it may conceyve and engendre. / Thou shalt eek considere alle
thise causes, fro whennes they been sprongen. /2400 And whan ye han
examined your conseil as I have seyd, and which partie is the bettre and
more profitable, and hast approved it by manye wyse folk and olde; / thanne
shaltou considere, if thou mayst parfourne it and maken of it a good ende.
/ For certes, resoun wol nat that any man sholde biginne a thing, but-if he
mighte parfourne it as him oghte. / Ne no wight sholde take up-on hym so
hevy a charge that he mighte nat bere it. / For the proverbe seith: "he
that to muche embraceth, distreyneth litel." /2405 And Catoun seith: "assay
to do swich thing as thou hast power to doon, lest that the charge [213]
oppresse thee so sore, that thee bihoveth to weyve thing that thou hast
bigonne." / And if so be that thou be in doute, whether thou mayst
parfourne a thing or noon, chese rather to suffre than biginne. / And Piers
Alphonce seith: "if thou hast might to doon a thing of which thou most
repente thee, it is bettre 'nay' than 'ye';" / this is to seyn, that thee
is bettre holde thy tonge stille, than for to speke. / Thanne may ye
understonde by strenger resons, that if thou hast power to parfourne a werk
of which thou shalt repente, thanne is it bettre that thou suffre than
biginne. /2410 Wel seyn they, that defenden every wight to assaye any thing
of which he is in doute, whether he may parfourne it or no. / And after,
whan ye han examined your conseil as I have seyd biforn, and knowen wel
that ye may parfourne youre emprise, conferme it thanne sadly til it be at
an ende. /

§ 25. Now is it resoun and tyme that I shewe yow, whanne, and wherfore,
that ye may chaunge your conseil with-outen your repreve. / Soothly, a man
may chaungen his purpos and his conseil if the cause cesseth, or whan a
newe caas bitydeth. / For the lawe seith: that "upon thinges that newely
bityden bihoveth newe conseil." /2415 And Senek seith: "if thy conseil is
comen to the eres of thyn enemy, chaunge thy conseil." / Thou mayst also
chaunge thy conseil if so be that thou finde that, by errour or by other
cause, harm or damage may bityde. / Also, if thy conseil be dishonest, or
elles cometh of dishoneste cause, chaunge thy conseil. / For the lawes
seyn: that "alle bihestes that been dishoneste been of no value." / And
eek, if it so be that it be inpossible, or may nat goodly be parfourned or

§ 27. This Melibeus, whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame
Prudence, answerde in this wyse. / 'Dame,' quod he, 'as yet in-to this tyme
ye han wel and covenably taught me as in general, how I shal governe me in
the chesinge and in the withholdinge of my conseillours. / But now wolde I
fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial, / and telle me how lyketh yow,

quod she, 'that your conseil as in this caas ne sholde nat, as to speke
properly, be called a conseilling, but a mocioun or a moevyng of folye; /
in which conseil ye han erred in many a sondry wyse. /2430

§ 29. First and forward, ye han erred in thassemblinge of your
conseillours. / For ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to your
conseil, and after ye mighte han shewed it to mo folk, if it hadde been
nede. / But certes, ye han sodeynly cleped to your conseil a greet
multitude of peple, ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to here. / Also ye
han erred, for there-as ye sholden only have cleped to your conseil your
trewe freendes olde and wyse, / ye han y-cleped straunge folk, and yong
folk, false flatereres, and enemys reconsiled, and folk that doon yow
reverence withouten love. /2435 And eek also ye have erred, for ye han
broght with yow to your conseil ire, covetise, and hastifnesse; / the
whiche three thinges been contrariouse to every conseil honeste and
profitable; / the whiche three thinges ye han nat anientissed or destroyed
hem, neither in your-self ne in your conseillours, as yow oghte. / Ye han
erred also, for ye han shewed to your conseillours your talent, and your
affeccioun to make werre anon and for to do vengeance; / they han espyed by
your wordes to what thing ye been enclyned. /2440 And therfore han they
rather conseilled yow to your talent than to your profit. / Ye han erred
also, for it semeth that yow suffyseth to han been conseilled by thise
conseillours only, and with litel avys; / wher-as, in so greet and so heigh
a nede, it hadde been necessarie mo conseillours, and more deliberacioun to
parfourne your emprise. / Ye han erred also, for ye han nat examined your
conseil in the forseyde manere, ne in due manere as the caas requireth. /
Ye han erred also, for ye han maked no divisioun bitwixe your conseillours;
this is to [215] seyn, bitwixen your trewe freendes and your feyned
conseillours; /2445 ne ye han nat knowe the wil of your trewe freendes olde
and wyse; / but ye han cast alle hir wordes in an hochepot, and enclyned
your herte to the more part and to the gretter nombre; and ther been ye
condescended. / And sith ye wot wel that men shal alwey finde a gretter
nombre of foles than of wyse men, / and therfore the conseils that been at
congregaciouns and multitudes of folk, ther-as men take more reward to the
nombre than to the sapience of persones, / ye see wel that in swiche
conseillinges foles han the maistrie.' /2450 Melibeus answerde agayn, and
seyde: 'I graunte wel that I have erred; / but ther-as thou hast told me
heer-biforn, that he nis nat to blame that chaungeth hise conseillours in
certein caas, and for certeine Iuste causes, / I am al redy to chaunge my
conseillours, right as thow wolt devyse. / The proverbe seith: that "for to
do sinne is mannish, but certes for to persevere longe in sinne is werk of

§ 30. To this sentence answerde anon dame Prudence, and seyde: /2455
'Examineth,' quod she, 'your conseil, and lat us see the whiche of hem han
spoken most resonably, and taught yow best conseil. / And for-as-muche as
that the examinacioun is necessarie, lat us biginne at the surgiens and at
the phisiciens, that first speken in this matere. / I sey yow, that the
surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in your conseil discreetly, as hem
oughte; / and in hir speche seyden ful wysly, that to the office of hem
aperteneth to doon to every wight honour and profit, and no wight for to

hem whiche that they han in hir governaunce. /2460 And sir, right as they
han answered wysly and discreetly, / right so rede I that they been heighly

the phisiciens entreteden in this caas, this is to seyn, / that, in
maladyes, that oon contrarie is warisshed by another contrarie, / I wolde
fayn knowe how ye understonde thilke text, and what is your sentence.' /
'Certes,' quod Melibeus, 'I understonde it in this wyse: / that, right as
they han doon me a contrarie, right so sholde I doon hem another. /2470 For
right as they han venged hem on me and doon me wrong, right so shal I venge

§ 31. 'Lo, lo!' quod dame Prudence, 'how lightly is every man enclyned to
his owene desyr and to his owene plesaunce! / Certes,' quod she, 'the
wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in this wyse.
/ For certes, wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse, ne vengeaunce to
vengeaunce, ne wrong to wrong; but they been semblable. /2475 And therfore,
o vengeaunce is nat warisshed by another vengeaunce, ne o wrong by another

the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in this wyse: / for
good and wikkednesse been two contraries, and pees and werre, vengeaunce
and suffraunce, discord and accord, and manye othere thinges. / But certes,
wikkednesse shal be warisshed by goodnesse, discord by accord, werre by
pees, and so forth of othere thinges. /2480 And heer-to accordeth Seint
Paul the apostle in manye places. / He seith: "ne yeldeth nat harm for
harm, ne wikked speche for wikked speche; / but do wel to him that dooth
thee harm, and blesse him that seith to thee harm." / And in manye othere
places he amonesteth pees and accord. / But now wol I speke to yow of the
conseil which that was yeven to yow by the men of lawe and the wyse folk,
/2485 that seyden alle by oon accord as ye han herd bifore; / that, over
alle thynges, ye sholde doon your diligence to kepen your persone and to
warnestore your hous. / And seyden also, that in this caas ye oghten for to
werken ful avysely and with greet deliberacioun. / And sir, as to the
firste point, that toucheth to the keping of your persone; / ye shul
understonde that he that hath werre shal evermore mekely and devoutly
preyen biforn alle thinges, /2490 that Iesus Crist of his grete [217] mercy
wol han him in his proteccioun, and been his sovereyn helping at his nede.
/ For certes, in this world ther is no wight that may be conseilled ne kept
suffisantly withouten the keping of our lord Iesu Crist. / To this sentence
accordeth the prophete David, that seith: / "if god ne kepe the citee, in
ydel waketh he that it kepeth." / Now sir, thanne shul ye committe the
keping of your persone to your trewe freendes that been approved and
y-knowe; /2495 and of hem shul ye axen help your persone for to kepe. For
Catoun seith: "if thou hast nede of help, axe it of thy freendes; / for
ther nis noon so good a phisicien as thy trewe freend." / And after this,
thanne shul ye kepe yow fro alle straunge folk, and fro lyeres, and have
alwey in suspect hir companye. / For Piers Alfonce seith: "ne tak no
companye by the weye of a straunge man, but-if so be that thou have knowe
him of a lenger tyme. / And if so be that he falle in-to thy companye
paraventure withouten thyn assent, /2500 enquere thanne, as subtilly as

seye that thou goost thider as thou wolt nat go; / and if he bereth a
spere, hold thee on the right syde, and if he bere a swerd, hold thee on
the lift syde." / And after this, thanne shul ye kepe yow wysely from alle
swich manere peple as I have seyd bifore, and hem and hir conseil eschewe.
/ And after this, thanne shul ye kepe yow in swich manere, / that for any
presumpcioun of your strengthe, that ye ne dispyse nat ne acounte nat the
might of your adversarie so litel, that ye lete the keping of your persone
for your presumpcioun; /2505 for every wys man dredeth his enemy. / And
Salomon seith: "weleful is he that of alle hath drede; / for certes, he
that thurgh the hardinesse of his herte and thurgh the hardinesse of
him-self hath to greet presumpcioun, him shal yvel bityde." / Thanne shul
ye evermore countrewayte embusshements and alle espiaille. / For Senek
seith: that "the wyse man that dredeth harmes escheweth harmes; /2510 ne he
ne falleth in-to perils, that perils escheweth." / And al-be-it so that it
seme that thou art in siker place, yet shaltow alwey do thy diligence in

/ Senek seith: "a man that is wel avysed, he dredeth his leste enemy." /
Ovide seith: that "the litel wesele wol slee the grete bole and the wilde

sore; and an hound wol holde the wilde boor." / But nathelees, I sey nat
thou shall be so coward that thou doute ther wher-as is no drede. / The
book seith: that "somme folk han greet lust to deceyve, but yet they dreden
hem to be deceyved." / Yet shaltou drede to been empoisoned, and kepe yow
from the companye of scorneres. / For the book seith: "with scorneres make

conseilled yow to warnestore your hous with gret diligence, / I wolde fayn
knowe, how that ye understonde thilke wordes, and what is your sentence.' /

§ 33. Melibeus answerde and seyde, 'Certes I understande it in this wise;
that I shal warnestore myn hous with toures, swiche as han castelles and
othere manere edifices, and armure and artelleries, / by whiche thinges I
may my persone and myn hous so kepen and defenden, that myne enemys shul

'of heighe toures and of grete edifices apperteneth som-tyme to pryde;
/2525 and eek men make heighe toures and grete edifices with grete costages
and with greet travaille; and whan that they been accompliced, yet be they
nat worth a stree, but-if they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde
and wyse. / And understond wel, that the gretteste and strongeste garnison
that a riche man may have, as wel to kepen his persone as hise goodes, is /
that he be biloved amonges his subgets and with hise neighebores. / For
thus seith Tullius: that "ther is a maner garnison that no man may
venquisse ne disconfite, and that is, / a lord to be biloved of hise
citezeins and of his peple." /2530

    2525, 6. E. Hn. Cm. Pt. Hl. _omit_ apperteneth ... edifices; Cp. Ln.

§ 35. Now sir, as to the thridde point; wher-as your olde and wise
conseillours seyden, that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in
this nede, / but that yow oghte purveyen and [219] apparaillen yow in this
caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun; / trewely, I trowe that
they seyden right wysly and right sooth. / For Tullius seith, "in every
nede, er thou biginne it, apparaille thee with greet diligence." / Thanne
seye I, that in vengeance-taking, in werre, in bataille, and in
warnestoring, /2535 er thow biginne, I rede that thou apparaille thee
ther-to, and do it with greet deliberacioun. / For Tullius seith: that
"long apparailling biforn the bataille maketh short victorie." / And
Cassidorus seith: "the garnison is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed."
/

    2537. E. Ln. The longe; _rest_ that long.

§ 36. But now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by your
neighebores, swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love, / your olde
enemys reconsiled, your flatereres, /2540 that conseilled yow certeyne
thinges prively, and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie; / the yonge
folk also, that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon. / And
certes, sir, as I have seyd biforn, ye han greetly erred to han cleped
swich maner folk to your conseil; / which conseillours been y-nogh repreved
by the resouns afore-seyd. / But nathelees, lat us now descende to the
special. Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius. /2545
Certes, the trouthe of this matere or of this conseil nedeth nat diligently
enquere; / for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this
trespas and vileinye, / and how manye trespassours, and in what manere they
han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileinye. / And after this,
thanne shul ye examine the seconde condicioun, which that the same Tullius
addeth in this matere. / For Tullius put a thing, which that he clepeth
"consentinge," this is to seyn; /2550 who been they and how manye, and
whiche been they, that consenteden to thy conseil, in thy wilfulnesse to
doon hastif vengeance. / And lat us considere also who been they, and how
manye been they, and whiche been they, that consenteden to your
adversaries. / And certes, as to the firste poynt, it is wel knowen whiche
folk been they that consenteden to your hastif wilfulnesse; / for trewely,
alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat your
freendes. / Lat us now considere whiche been they, that ye holde so greetly
your freendes as to your persone. /2555 For al-be-it so that ye be mighty
[220] and riche, certes ye ne been nat but allone. / For certes, ye ne han
no child but a doghter; / ne ye ne han bretheren ne cosins germayns, ne
noon other neigh kinrede, / wherfore that your enemys, for drede, sholde
stinte to plede with yow or to destroye your persone. / Ye knowen also,
that your richesses moten been dispended in diverse parties; /2560 and whan
that every wight hath his part, they ne wollen taken but litel reward to
venge thy deeth. / But thyne enemys been three, and they han manie
children, bretheren, cosins, and other ny kinrede; / and, though so were
that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three, yet dwellen ther y-nowe to
wreken hir deeth and to slee thy persone. / And though so be that your
kinrede be more siker and stedefast than the kin of your adversarie, / yet
nathelees your kinrede nis but a fer kinrede; they been but litel sib to
yow, /2565 and the kin of your enemys been ny sib to hem. And certes, as in
that, hir condicioun is bet than youres. / Thanne lat us considere also if
the conseilling of hem that conseilleden yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce,
whether it accorde to resoun? / And certes, ye knowe wel "nay." / For as by
right and resoun, ther may no man taken vengeance on no wight, but the Iuge
that hath the Iurisdiccioun of it, / whan it is graunted him to take thilke
vengeance, hastily or attemprely, as the lawe requireth. /2570 And yet
more-over, of thilke word that Tullius clepeth "consentinge," / thou shalt
considere if thy might and thy power may consenten and suffyse to thy
wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours. / And certes, thou mayst wel seyn that
"nay." / For sikerly, as for to speke proprely, we may do no-thing but only
swich thing as we may doon rightfully. / And certes, rightfully ne mowe ye
take no vengeance as of your propre auctoritee. /2575 Thanne mowe ye seen,
that your power ne consenteth nat ne accordeth nat with your wilfulnesse. /
Lat us now examine the thridde point that Tullius clepeth "consequent." /
Thou shalt understonde that the vengeance that thou purposest for to take
is the consequent. / And ther-of folweth another vengeaunce, peril, and
werre; and othere damages with-oute nombre, of whiche we be nat war as at
this tyme. / And as touchinge the fourthe point, that Tullius clepeth
"engendringe," /2580 thou shalt considere, that this wrong which that is
doon to thee is engendred of the hate of thyne enemys; / and of the
vengeance-takinge upon that wolde engendre another vengeance, and muchel
sorwe and wastinge of richesses, as I seyde. /

    2551. E. _om._ and whiche been they; _see_ 2552.   Hk. consentid;
    _rest_ consenten (_for_ consenteden); _see_ 2552.

[221] § 37. Now sir, as to the point that Tullius clepeth "causes," which
that is the laste point, / thou shall understonde that the wrong that thou
hast receyved hath certeine causes, / whiche that clerkes clepen _Oriens_
and _Efficiens_, and _Causa longinqua_ and _Causa propinqua_; this is to
seyn, the fer cause and the ny cause. /2585 The fer cause is almighty god,
that is cause of alle thinges. / The neer cause is thy three enemys. / The
cause accidental was hate. / The cause material been the fyve woundes of
thy doghter. / The cause formal is the manere of hir werkinge, that
broghten laddres and cloumben in at thy windowes. /2590 The cause final was
for to slee thy doghter; it letted nat in as muche as in hem was. / But for
to speken of the fer cause, as to what ende they shul come, or what shal
finally bityde of hem in this caas, ne can I nat deme but by coniectinge
and by supposinge. / For we shul suppose that they shul come to a wikked
ende, / by-cause that the Book of Decrees seith: "selden or with greet
peyne been causes y-broght to good ende whanne they been baddely bigonne."
/

    2594. E. seelden.

§ 38. Now sir, if men wolde axe me, why that god suffred men to do yow this
vileinye, certes, I can nat wel answere as for no sothfastnesse. /2595 For
thapostle seith, that "the sciences and the Iuggementz of our lord god
almighty been ful depe; / ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem
suffisantly." / Nathelees, by certeyne presumpcions and coniectinges, I
holde and bileve / that god, which that is ful of Iustice and of
rightwisnesse, hath suffred this bityde by Iuste cause resonable. /

§ 39. Thy name is Melibee, this is to seyn, "a man that drinketh hony."
/2600 Thou hast y-dronke so muchel hony of swete temporel richesses and
delices and honours of this world, / that thou art dronken; and hast
forgeten Iesu Crist thy creatour; / thou ne hast nat doon to him swich
honour and reverence as thee oughte. / Ne thou ne hast nat wel y-taken kepe
to the wordes of Ovide, that seith: / "under the hony of the godes of the
body is hid the venim that sleeth the soule." /2605 And Salomon seith, "if
thou hast founden hony, ete of it that suffyseth; / for if thou ete of it
out of mesure, thou shalt spewe," and be nedy and povre. / And peraventure
Crist hath thee in despit, and hath turned awey fro thee his face and hise
eres of misericorde; / and also he hath suffred that thou hast been
punisshed in the manere that thow [222] hast y-trespassed. / Thou hast doon
sinne agayn our lord Crist; /2610 for certes, the three enemys of mankinde,
that is to seyn, the flessh, the feend, and the world, / thou hast suffred
hem entre in-to thyn herte wilfully by the windowes of thy body, / and hast
nat defended thy-self suffisantly agayns hir assautes and hir temptaciouns,
so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve places; / this is to seyn, the
deedly sinnes that been entred in-to thyn herte by thy fyve wittes. / And
in the same manere our lord Crist hath wold and suffred, that thy three
enemys been entred in-to thyn hous by the windowes, /2615 and han y-wounded
thy doghter in the fore-seyde manere.' /

    2601. E. sweete temporeel.   2608. E. eeris.

§ 40. 'Certes,' quod Melibee, 'I see wel that ye enforce yow muchel by
wordes to overcome me in swich manere, that I shal nat venge me of myne
enemys; / shewinge me the perils and the yveles that mighten falle of this
vengeance. / But who-so wolde considere in alle vengeances the perils and
yveles that mighte sewe of vengeance-takinge, / a man wolde never take
vengeance, and that were harm; /2620 for by the vengeance-takinge been the
wikked men dissevered fro the gode men. / And they that han wil to do
wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos, whan they seen the punissinge and
chastysinge of the trespassours.' / [And to this answerde dame Prudence:
'Certes,' seyde she, 'I graunte wel that of vengeaunce cometh muchel yvel
and muchel good; / but vengeaunce-taking aperteneth nat unto everichoon,
but only unto Iuges and unto hem that han Iurisdicctioun upon the
trespassours.] / And yet seye I more, that right as a singuler persone
sinneth in takinge vengeance of another man, /2625 right so sinneth the
Iuge if he do no vengeance of hem that it han deserved. / For Senek seith
thus: "that maister," he seith, "is good that proveth shrewes." / And as
Cassidore seith: "A man dredeth to do outrages, whan he woot and knoweth
that it displeseth to the Iuges and sovereyns." / And another seith: "the
Iuge that dredeth to do right, maketh men shrewes." / And Seint Paule the
apostle seith in his epistle, whan he wryteth un-to the Romayns: that "the
Iuges beren nat the spere with-outen cause;" /2630 but they beren it to
punisse the shrewes and misdoeres, and for to defende the gode men. / If ye
wol thanne take vengeance of [223] your enemys, ye shul retourne or have
your recours to the Iuge that hath the Iurisdiccion up-on hem; / and he
shal punisse hem as the lawe axeth and requyreth.' /

§ 41. 'A!' quod Melibee, 'this vengeance lyketh me no-thing. / I bithenke
me now and take hede, how fortune hath norissed me fro my childhede, and
hath holpen me to passe many a strong pas. /2635 Now wol I assayen hir,
trowinge, with goddes help, that she shal helpe me my shame for to venge.'
/

§ 42. 'Certes,' quod Prudence, 'if ye wol werke by my conseil, ye shul nat
assaye fortune by no wey; / ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hir, after the
word of Senek: / for "thinges that been folily doon, and that been in hope
of fortune, shullen never come to good ende." / And as the same Senek
seith: "the more cleer and the more shyning that fortune is, the more
brotil and the sonner broken she is." /2640 Trusteth nat in hir, for she
nis nat stidefast ne stable; / for whan thow trowest to be most seur or
siker of hir help, she wol faille thee and deceyve thee. / And wher-as ye
seyn that fortune hath norissed yow fro your childhede, / I seye, that in
so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hir and in hir wit. / For Senek
seith: "what man that is norissed by fortune, she maketh him a greet fool."
/2645 Now thanne, sin ye desyre and axe vengeance, and the vengeance that
is doon after the lawe and bifore the Iuge ne lyketh yow nat, / and the
vengeance that is doon in hope of fortune is perilous and uncertein, /
thanne have ye noon other remedie but for to have your recours unto the
sovereyn Iuge that vengeth alle vileinyes and wronges; / and he shal venge

§ 43. Melibee answerde, 'if I ne venge me nat of the vileinye that men han
doon to me, / I sompne or warne hem that han doon to me that vileinye and
alle othere, to do me another vileinye. / For it is writen: "if thou take
no vengeance of an old vileinye, thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee
a newe vileinye." / And also, for my suffrance, men wolden do to me so
muchel vileinye, that I mighte neither here it ne sustene; / and so sholde
I been put and holden over lowe. /2655 For men seyn: "in muchel suffringe

[224] § 44. 'Certes,' quod Prudence, 'I graunte yow that over muchel
suffraunce nis nat good; / but yet ne folweth it nat ther-of, that every
persone to whom men doon vileinye take of it vengeance; / for that
aperteneth and longeth al only to the Iuges, for they shul venge the
vileinyes and iniuries. / And ther-fore tho two auctoritees that ye han
seyd above, been only understonden in the Iuges; /2660 for whan they
suffren over muchel the wronges and the vileinyes to be doon withouten
punisshinge, / they sompne nat a man al only for to do newe wronges, but
they comanden it. / Also a wys man seith: that "the Iuge that correcteth
nat the sinnere comandeth and biddeth him do sinne." / And the Iuges and
sovereyns mighten in hir land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and
misdoeres, / that they sholden by swich suffrance, by proces of tyme, wexen
of swich power and might, that they sholden putte out the Iuges and the
sovereyns from hir places, /2665 and atte laste maken hem lesen hir
lordshipes. /

§ 45. But lat us now putte, that ye have leve to venge yow. / I seye ye
been nat of might and power as now to venge yow. / For if ye wole maken
comparisoun un-to the might of your adversaries, ye shul finde in manye
thinges, that I have shewed yow er this, that hir condicioun is bettre than
youres. / And therfore seye I, that it is good as now that ye suffre and be
pacient. /2670

§ 46. Forther-more, ye knowen wel that, after the comune sawe, "it is a
woodnesse a man to stryve with a strenger or a more mighty man than he is
him-self; / and for to stryve with a man of evene strengthe, that is to
seyn, with as strong a man as he, it is peril; / and for to stryve with a
weyker man, it is folie." / And therfore sholde a man flee stryvinge as
muchel as he mighte. / For Salomon seith: "it is a greet worship to a man
to kepen him fro noyse and stryf." /2675 And if it so bifalle or happe that
a man of gretter might and strengthe than thou art do thee grevaunce, /
studie and bisie thee rather to stille the same grevaunce, than for to
venge thee. / For Senek seith: that "he putteth him in greet peril that
stryveth with a gretter man than he is him-self." / And Catoun seith: "if a
man of hyer estaat or degree, or more mighty than thou, do thee anoy or
grevaunce, suffre him; / for he that ones hath greved thee may another tyme
releve thee and helpe." /2680 Yet sette I caas, ye have bothe might and
licence for to [225] venge yow. / I seye, that ther be ful manye thinges
that shul restreyne yow of vengeance-takinge, / and make yow for to enclyne
to suffre, and for to han pacience in the thinges that han been doon to
yow. / First and foreward, if ye wole considere the defautes that been in
your owene persone, / for whiche defautes god hath suffred yow have this
tribulacioun, as I have seyd yow heer-biforn. /2685 For the poete seith,
that "we oghte paciently taken the tribulacions that comen to us, whan we
thinken and consideren that we han deserved to have hem." / And Seint
Gregorie seith: that "whan a man considereth wel the nombre of hise
defautes and of his sinnes, / the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he
suffreth semen the lesse un-to hym; / and in-as-muche as him thinketh hise
sinnes more hevy and grevous, / in-so-muche semeth his peyne the lighter
and the esier un-to him." /2690 Also ye owen to enclyne and bowe your herte
to take the pacience of our lord Iesu Crist, as seith seint Peter in hise
epistles: / "Iesu Crist," he seith, "hath suffred for us, and yeven
ensample to every man to folwe and sewe him; / for he dide never sinne, ne
never cam ther a vileinous word out of his mouth: / whan men cursed him, he
cursed hem noght; and whan men betten him, he manaced hem noght." / Also
the grete pacience, which the seintes that been in paradys han had in
tribulaciouns that they han y-suffred, with-outen hir desert or gilt, /2695
oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience. / Forthermore, ye sholde enforce yow
to have pacience, / consideringe that the tribulaciouns of this world but
litel whyle endure, and sone passed been and goon. / And the Ioye that a
man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable, after that
the apostle seith in his epistle: / "the Ioye of god," he seith, "is
perdurable," that is to seyn, everlastinge. /2700 Also troweth and bileveth
stedefastly, that he nis nat wel y-norissed ne wel y-taught, that can nat
have pacience or wol nat receyve pacience. / For Salomon seith: that "the
doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by pacience." / And in another
place he seith: that "he that is pacient governeth him by greet prudence."
/ And the same Salomon seith: "the angry and wrathful man maketh noyses,
and the pacient man atempreth hem and stilleth." / He seith also: "it is
more worth to be pacient than for to be right strong; /2705 and he that may
have the lordshipe of his owene herte is more to preyse, than [226] he that
by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees." / And therfore seith seint
Iame in his epistle: that "pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun."' /

§ 47. 'Certes,' quod Melibee, 'I graunte yow, dame Prudence, that pacience
is a greet vertu of perfeccioun; / but every man may nat have the
perfeccioun that ye seken; / ne I nam nat of the nombre of right parfite
men, /2710 for myn herte may never been in pees un-to the tyme it be

a vileinye in takinge vengeance up-on me, / yet token they noon hede of the
peril, but fulfilleden hir wikked wil and hir corage. / And therfore, me
thinketh men oghten nat repreve me, though I putte me in a litel peril for

§ 48. 'A!' quod dame Prudence, 'ye seyn your wil and as yow lyketh; / but
in no caas of the world a man sholde nat doon outrage ne excesse for to
vengen him. / For Cassidore seith: that "as yvel doth he that vengeth him
by outrage, as he that doth the outrage." / And therfore ye shul venge yow
after the ordre of right, that is to seyn by the lawe, and noght by excesse
ne by outrage. / And also, if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of your
adversaries in other maner than right comandeth, ye sinnen; /2720 and
therfore seith Senek: that "a man shal never vengen shrewednesse by
shrewednesse." / And if ye seye, that right axeth a man to defenden
violence by violence, and fighting by fighting, / certes ye seye sooth,
whan the defense is doon anon with-outen intervalle or with-outen tarying
or delay, / for to defenden him and nat for to vengen him. / And it
bihoveth that a man putte swich attemperance in his defence, /2725 that men
have no cause ne matere to repreven him that defendeth him of excesse and
outrage; for elles were it agayn resoun. / Pardee, ye knowen wel, that ye
maken no defence as now for to defende yow, but for to venge yow; / and so
seweth it that ye han no wil to do your dede attemprely. / And therfore, me

inpacient and wroth, of that that toucheth him noght and that aperteneth
nat un-to him, though it harme him, it is no wonder. /2730 For the lawe
seith: that "he is coupable that entremetteth or medleth with swich thyng
as aperteneth nat un-to him." / And Salomon seith: that "he that
entremetteth him of the noyse or stryf of another man, is lyk to him that
taketh an hound by the eres." / For right as he that taketh a straunge
hound by the eres is outherwhyle biten with the hound, / right in the same
wyse is it resoun that he have harm, that by his inpacience medleth him of
the noyse of another man, wher-as it aperteneth nat un-to him. / But ye

it is no merveille. / And savinge your grace, I can nat seen that it mighte
greetly harme me though I toke vengeaunce; / for I am richer and more
mighty than myne enemys been. / And wel knowen ye, that by moneye and by
havinge grete possessions been all the thinges of this world governed. /
And Salomon seith: that "alle thinges obeyen to moneye."' /2740

§ 50. Whan Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten him of his richesse
and of his moneye, dispreisinge the power of hise adversaries, she spak,
and seyde in this wyse: / 'certes, dere sir, I graunte yow that ye been
rich and mighty, / and that the richesses been goode to hem that han wel
y-geten hem and wel conne usen hem. / For right as the body of a man may
nat liven with-oute the soule, namore may it live with-outen temporel
goodes. / And by richesses may a man gete him grete freendes. /2745 And
therfore seith Pamphilles: "if a net-herdes doghter," seith he, "be riche,
she may chesen of a thousand men which she wol take to hir housbonde; /
for, of a thousand men, oon wol nat forsaken hir ne refusen hir." / And
this Pamphilles seith also: "if thou be right happy, that is to seyn, if
thou be right riche, thou shalt find a greet nombre of felawes and
freendes. / And if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre, farewel
freendshipe and felaweshipe; / for thou shalt be allone with-outen any
companye, but-if it be the companye of povre folk." /2750 And yet seith
this Pamphilles moreover: that "they that been thralle and bonde of [228]
linage shullen been maad worthy and noble by the richesses." / And right so
as by richesses ther comen manye goodes, right so by poverte come ther
manye harmes and yveles. / For greet poverte constreyneth a man to do manye
yveles. / And therfore clepeth Cassidore poverte "the moder of ruine," /
that is to seyn, the moder of overthrowinge or fallinge doun. /2755 And
therfore seith Piers Alfonce: "oon of the gretteste adversitees of this
world is / whan a free man, by kinde or by burthe, is constreyned by
poverte to eten the almesse of his enemy." / And the same seith Innocent in
oon of hise bokes; he seith: that "sorweful and mishappy is the condicioun
of a povre begger; / for if he axe nat his mete, he dyeth for hunger; / and
if he axe, he dyeth for shame; and algates necessitee constreyneth him to
axe." /2760 And therfore seith Salomon: that "bet it is to dye than for to
have swich poverte." / And as the same Salomon seith: "bettre it is to dye
of bitter deeth than for to liven in swich wyse." / By thise resons that I
have seid un-to yow, and by manye othere resons that I coude seye, / I
graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel, and to hem
that wel usen tho richesses. / And therfore wol I shewe yow how ye shul

§ 51. First, ye shul geten hem with-outen greet desyr, by good leyser
sokingly, and nat over hastily. / For a man that is to desyringe to gete
richesses abaundoneth him first to thefte and to alle other yveles. / And
therfore seith Salomon: "he that hasteth him to bisily to wexe riche shal
be noon innocent." / He seith also: that "the richesse that hastily cometh
to a man, sone and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man; / but that richesse
that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplyeth." /2770 And sir,
ye shul geten richesses by your wit and by your travaille un-to your
profit; / and that with-outen wrong or harm-doinge to any other persone. /
For the lawe seith: that "ther maketh no man himselven riche, if he do harm
to another wight;" / this is to seyn, that nature defendeth and forbedeth
by right, that no man make him-self riche un-to the harm of another
persone. / And Tullius seith: that "no sorwe ne no drede of deeth, ne
no-thing that may falle un-to a man /2775 is so muchel agayns nature, as a
man to [229] encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man. / And
though the grete men and the mighty men geten richesses more lightly than
thou, / yet shaltou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy profit; for thou shalt
in alle wyse flee ydelnesse." / For Salomon seith: that "ydelnesse techeth
a man to do manye yveles." / And the same Salomon seith: that "he that
travailleth and bisieth him to tilien his land, shal eten breed; /2780 but
he that is ydel and casteth him to no bisinesse ne occupacioun, shal falle
in-to poverte, and dye for hunger." / And he that is ydel and slow can
never finde covenable tyme for to doon his profit. / For ther is a
versifiour seith: that "the ydel man excuseth hym in winter, by cause of
the grete cold; and in somer, by enchesoun of the hete." / For thise causes
seith Caton: "waketh and enclyneth nat yow over muchel for to slepe; for
over muchel reste norisseth and causeth manye vices." / And therfore seith
seint Ierome: "doth somme gode dedes, that the devel which is our enemy ne
finde yow nat unoccupied." /2785 For the devel ne taketh nat lightly un-to
his werkinge swiche as he findeth occupied in gode werkes. /

§ 52. Thanne thus, in getinge richesses, ye mosten flee ydelnesse. / And
afterward, ye shul use the richesses, whiche ye have geten by your wit and
by your travaille, / in swich a manere, that men holde nat yow to scars, ne
to sparinge, ne to fool-large, that is to seyn, over-large a spender. / For
right as men blamen an avaricious man by-cause of his scarsetee and
chincherye, /2790 in the same wyse is he to blame that spendeth over
largely. / And therfore seith Caton: "use," he seith, "thy richesses that
thou hast geten / in swich a manere, that men have no matere ne cause to
calle thee neither wrecche ne chinche; / for it is a greet shame to a man
to have a povere herte and a riche purs." / He seith also: "the goodes that
thou hast y-geten, use hem by mesure," that is to seyn, spende hem
mesurably; /2795 for they that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that
they han, / whan they han namore propre of hir owene, they shapen hem to
take the goodes of another man. / I seye thanne, that ye shul fleen
avarice; / usinge your richesses in swich manere, that men seye nat that
your richesses been y-buried, / but that ye have hem in [230] your might
and in your weeldinge. /2800 For a wys man repreveth the avaricious man,
and seith thus, in two vers: / "wherto and why burieth a man hise goodes by
his grete avarice, and knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye; / for deeth is
the ende of every man as in this present lyf." / And for what cause or
enchesoun Ioyneth he him or knitteth he him so faste un-to hise goodes, /
that alle his wittes mowen nat disseveren him or departen him from hise
goodes; /2805 and knoweth wel, or oghte knowe, that whan he is deed, he
shal no-thing bere with him out of this world. / And ther-fore seith seint
Augustin: that "the avaricious man is likned un-to helle; / that the more
it swelweth, the more desyr it hath to swelwe and devoure." / And as wel as
ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chinche, / as wel sholde
ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wyse that men calle yow nat
fool-large. /2810 Therfore seith Tullius: "the goodes," he seith, "of thyn
hous ne sholde nat been hid, ne kept so cloos but that they mighte been
opened by pitee and debonairetee;" / that is to seyn, to yeven part to hem
that han greet nede; / "ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene, to been
every mannes goodes." / Afterward, in getinge of your richesses and in
usinge hem, ye shul alwey have three thinges in your herte; / that is to
seyn, our lord god, conscience, and good name. /2815 First, ye shul have
god in your herte; / and for no richesse ye shullen do nothing, which may
in any manere displese god, that is your creatour and maker. / For after
the word of Salomon: "it is bettre to have a litel good with the love of
god, / than to have muchel good and tresour, and lese the love of his lord
god." / And the prophete seith: that "bettre it is to been a good man and
have litel good and tresour, /2820 than to been holden a shrewe and have
grete richesses." / And yet seye I ferthermore, that ye sholde alwey doon
your bisinesse to gete yow richesses, / so that ye gete hem with good
conscience. / And thapostle seith: that "ther nis thing in this world, of
which we sholden have so greet Ioye as whan our conscience bereth us good
witnesse." / And the wyse man seith: "the substance of a man is ful good,
whan sinne is nat in mannes conscience." /2825 Afterward, in getinge of
your richesses, and in usinge of hem, / yow moste have greet bisinesse and
greet diligence, that your goode name be alwey kept and conserved. / For
Salomon seith: that "bettre it is and more it availleth a man to have a
good name, than for to have grete richesses." / [231] And therfore he seith
in another place: "do greet diligence," seith Salomon, "in keping of thy
freend and of thy gode name; / for it shal lenger abide with thee than any
tresour, be it never so precious." /2830 And certes he sholde nat be called
a gentil man, that after god and good conscience, alle thinges left, ne
dooth his diligence and bisinesse to kepen his good name. / And Cassidore
seith: that "it is signe of a gentil herte, whan a man loveth and desyreth
to han a good name." / And therfore seith seint Augustin: that "ther been
two thinges that arn necessarie and nedefulle, / and that is good
conscience and good loos; / that is to seyn, good conscience to thyn owene
persone inward, and good loos for thy neighebore outward." /2835 And he
that trusteth him so muchel in his gode conscience, / that he displeseth
and setteth at noght his gode name or loos, and rekketh noght though he
kepe nat his gode name, nis but a cruel cherl. /

§ 53. Sire, now have I shewed yow how ye shul do in getinge richesses, and
how ye shullen usen hem; / and I se wel, that for the trust that ye han in
youre richesses, ye wole moeve werre and bataille. / I conseille yow, that
ye biginne no werre in trust of your richesses; for they ne suffysen noght
werres to mayntene. /2840 And therfore seith a philosophre: "that man that
desyreth and wole algates han werre, shal never have suffisaunce; / for the
richer that he is, the gretter despenses moste he make, if he wole have
worship and victorie." / And Salomon seith: that "the gretter richesses
that a man hath, the mo despendours he hath." / And dere sire, al-be-it so
that for your richesses ye mowe have muchel folk, / yet bihoveth it nat, ne
it is nat good, to biginne werre, where-as ye mowe in other manere have
pees, un-to your worship and profit. /2845 For the victories of batailles
that been in this world, lyen nat in greet nombre or multitude of the peple
ne in the vertu of man; / but it lyth in the wil and in the hand of our
lord god almighty. / And therfore Iudas Machabeus, which was goddes knight,
/ whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversarie that hadde a greet nombre, and
a gretter multitude of folk and strenger than was this peple of Machabee, /
yet he reconforted his litel companye, and seyde right in this wyse: /2850
"als lightly," quod he, "may our lord god almighty yeve victorie to a fewe
folk as to many folk; / for the victorie of bataile cometh nat by the grete
[232] nombre of peple, / but it cometh from our lord god of hevene." / And
dere sir, for as muchel as there is no man certein, if he be worthy that
god yeve him victorie, [namore than he is certein whether he be worthy of
the love of god] or naught, after that Salomon seith, / therfore every man
sholde greetly drede werres to biginne. /2855 And by-cause that in
batailles fallen manye perils, / and happeth outher-while, that as sone is
the grete man sleyn as the litel man; / and, as it is written in the
seconde book of Kinges, "the dedes of batailles been aventurouse and
nothing certeyne;" / for as lightly is oon hurt with a spere as another. /
And for ther is gret peril in werre, therfore sholde a man flee and eschewe
werre, in as muchel as a man may goodly. /2860 For Salomon seith: "he that
loveth peril shal falle in peril."' /

§ 54. After that Dame Prudence hadde spoken in this manere, Melibee
answerde and seyde, / 'I see wel, dame Prudence, that by your faire wordes
and by your resons that ye han shewed me, that the werre lyketh yow
no-thing; / but I have nat yet herd your conseil, how I shal do in this

§ 55. 'Certes,' quod she, 'I conseille yow that ye accorde with youre
adversaries, and that ye haue pees with hem. /2865 For seint Iame seith in

and by debaat and discord the grete richesses fallen doun." / And ye knowen
wel that oon of the gretteste and most sovereyn thing, that is in this
world, is unitee and pees. / And therfore seyde oure lord Iesu Crist to
hise apostles in this wyse: / "wel happy and blessed been they that loven

as I do myn owene, and ever have doon; / ne ye ne noon other syen never the
contrarie. / And yit, if I hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees
and the reconsiliacioun, I ne hadde nat muchel mistaken me, ne seyd amis.
/2880 For the wyse man seith: "the dissensioun biginneth by another man,
and the reconsiling bi-ginneth by thy-self." / And the prophete seith:
"flee shrewednesse and do goodnesse; / seke pees and folwe it, as muchel as
in thee is." / Yet seye I nat that ye shul rather pursue to your
adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow; / for I knowe wel that ye been

to do right as ye wol desyre; / and if ye repreve me of my folye, I am the
more holden to love yow and to preyse yow. / For Salomon seith: that "he

wratthe, / than he that supporteth him and preyseth him in his misdoinge,
and laugheth at his folye." / And this same Salomon seith afterward: that

bitwene god and yow; / and beth reconsiled un-to him and to his grace.
/2905 For as I have seyd yow heer-biforn, god hath suffred yow to have this
tribulacioun and disese for your sinnes. / And if ye do as I sey yow, god
wol sende your adversaries un-to yow, / and maken hem fallen at your feet,
redy to do your wil and your comandements. / For Salomon seith: "whan the
condicioun of man is plesaunt and likinge to god, / he chaungeth the hertes
of the mannes adversaries, and constreyneth hem to biseken him of pees and
of grace." /2910 And I prey yow, lat me speke with your adversaries in
privee place; / for they shul nat knowe that it be of your wil or your
assent. / And thanne, whan I knowe hir wil and hir entente, I may conseille
yow the more seurly.' /

§ 61. 'Dame,' quod Melibee, 'dooth your wil and your lykinge, / for I putte
me hoolly in your disposicioun and ordinaunce.' /2915

§ 62. Thanne Dame Prudence, whan she saugh the gode wil of her housbonde,
delibered and took avys in hir-self, / thinkinge how she mighte bringe this
nede un-to a good conclusioun and to a good ende. / And whan she saugh hir
tyme, she sente for thise adversaries to come un-to hir in-to a privee
place, / and shewed wysly un-to hem the grete goodes that comen of pees, /
and the grete harmes and perils that been in werre; /2920 and seyde to hem
in a goodly manere, how that hem oughte have greet repentaunce / of the
iniurie and wrong that they hadden doon to Melibee hir lord, and to hir,
and to hir doghter. /

    2921. Cm. oughte; Cp. Hl. aughte; _rest_ oughten.

§ 63. And whan they herden the goodliche wordes of dame Prudence, / they
weren so surprised and ravisshed, and hadden so greet Ioye of hir, that
wonder was to telle. / 'A! lady!' quod they, 'ye han shewed un-to us "the
blessinge of swetnesse," after the sawe of David the prophete; /2925 for
the reconsilinge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere, / but we
oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humilitee, / ye of your grete
goodnesse have presented unto us. / Now see we wel that the science and the
conninge of Salomon is ful trewe; / for he seith: that "swete wordes
multiplyen and encresen freendes, and maken shrewes to be debonaire and
meke." /2930

    2924. Hl. surprised; Cm. suppreysed; _rest_ supprised.

[235] § 64. 'Certes,' quod they, 'we putten our dede and al our matere and
cause al hoolly in your goode wil; / and been redy to obeye to the speche
and comandement of my lord Melibee. / And therfore, dere and benigne lady,
we preyen yow and biseke yow as mekely as we conne and mowen, / that it
lyke un-to your grete goodnesse to fulfillen in dede your goodliche wordes;
/ for we consideren and knowlichen that we han offended and greved my lord
Melibee out of mesure; /2935 so ferforth, that we be nat of power to maken
hise amendes. / And therfore we oblige and binden us and our freendes to
doon al his wil and hise comandements. / But peraventure he hath swich
hevinesse and swich wratthe to us-ward, by-cause of our offence, / that he
wole enioyne us swich a peyne as we mowe nat here ne sustene. / And
therfore, noble lady, we biseke to your wommanly pitee, /2940 to taken
swich avysement in this nede, that we, ne our freendes, be nat desherited
ne destroyed thurgh our folye.' /

§ 65. 'Certes,' quod Prudence, 'it is an hard thing and right perilous, /
that a man putte him al outrely in the arbitracioun and Iuggement, and in
the might and power of hise enemys. / For Salomon seith: "leveth me, and
yeveth credence to that I shal seyn; I seye," quod he, "ye peple, folk, and
governours of holy chirche, / to thy sone, to thy wyf, to thy freend, ne to
thy brother /2945 ne yeve thou never might ne maistrie of thy body, whyl
thou livest." / Now sithen he defendeth, that man shal nat yeven to his
brother ne to his freend the might of his body, / by a strenger resoun he
defendeth and forbedeth a man to yeven him-self to his enemy. / And
nathelees I conseille you, that ye mistruste nat my lord. / For I wool wel
and knowe verraily, that he is debonaire and meke, large, curteys, /2950
and nothing desyrous ne coveitous of good ne richesse. / For ther nis
no-thing in this world that he desyreth, save only worship and honour. /
Forther-more I knowe wel, and am right seur, that he shal no-thing doon in
this nede with-outen my conseil. / And I shal so werken in this cause,
that, by grace of our lord god, ye shul been reconsiled un-to us.' /

§ 66. Thanne seyden they with o vois, 'worshipful lady, we putten us and
our goodes al fully in your wil and disposicioun; /2955 and been redy to
comen, what day that it lyke un-to your noblesse to limite us or assigne
us, / for to maken our obligacioun and bond as strong as it lyketh un-to
your goodnesse; / that we mowe fulfille the wille of yow and of my lord
Melibee.' /

[236] § 67. Whan dame Prudence hadde herd the answeres of thise men, she
bad hem goon agayn prively; / and she retourned to hir lord Melibee, and
tolde him how she fond hise adversaries ful repentant, /2960 knowlechinge
ful lowely hir sinnes and trespas, and how they were redy to suffren al
peyne, / requiringe and preyinge him of mercy and pitee. /

§ 68. Thanne seyde Melibee, 'he is wel worthy to have pardoun and
foryifnesse of his sinne, that excuseth nat his sinne, / but knowlecheth it
and repenteth him, axinge indulgence. / For Senek seith: "ther is the
remissioun and foryifnesse, where-as confessioun is;" /2965 for confession
is neighebore to innocence. / And he seith in another place: "he that hath
shame for his sinne and knowlecheth it, is worthy remissioun." And therfore
I assente and conferme me to have pees; / but it is good that we do it nat
with-outen the assent and wil of our freendes.' /

§ 69. Thanne was Prudence right glad and loyeful, and seyde, / 'Certes,
sir,' quod she, 'ye han wel and goodly answered. /2970 For right as by the
conseil, assent, and help of your freendes, ye han been stired to venge yow
and maken werre, / right so with-outen hir conseil shul ye nat accorden
yow, ne have pees with your adversaries. / For the lawe seith: "ther nis
no-thing so good by wey of kinde, as a thing to been unbounde by him that
it was y-bounde."' /

§ 70. And thanne dame Prudence, with-outen delay or taryinge, sente anon
hir messages for hir kin, and for hir olde freendes whiche that were trewe
and wyse, / and tolde hem by ordre, in the presence of Melibee, al this
matere as it is aboven expressed and declared; /2975 and preyden hem that
they wolde yeven hir avys and conseil, what best were to doon in this nede.
/ And whan Melibees freendes hadde taken hir avys and deliberacioun of the
forseide matere, / and hadden examined it by greet bisinesse and greet
diligence, / they yave ful conseil for to have pees and reste; / and that
Melibee sholde receyve with good herte hise adversaries to foryifnesse and
mercy. /2980

§ 71. And whan dame Prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord Melibee, and
the conseil of hise freendes, / accorde with hir wille and hir entencioun,
/ she was wonderly glad in hir herte, and [237] seyde: / 'ther is an old
proverbe,' quod she, 'seith: that "the goodnesse that thou mayst do this
day, do it; / and abyde nat ne delaye it nat til to-morwe." /2985 And
therfore I conseille that ye sende your messages, swiche as been discrete
and wyse, / un-to your adversaries; tellinge hem, on your bihalve, / that
if they wole trete of pees and of accord, / that they shape hem, with-outen
delay or tarying, to comen un-to us.' / Which thing parfourned was in dede.
/2990 And whanne thise trespassours and repentinge folk of hir folies, that
is to seyn, the adversaries of Melibee, / hadden herd what thise messagers
seyden un-to hem, / they weren right glad and Ioyeful, and answereden ful
mekely and benignely, / yeldinge graces and thankinges to hir lord Melibee
and to al his companye; / and shopen hem, with-outen delay, to go with the
messagers, and obeye to the comandement of hir lord Melibee. /2995

§ 72. And right anon they token hir wey to the court of Melibee, / and
token with hem somme of hir trewe freendes, to maken feith for hem and for
to been hir borwes. / And whan they were comen to the presence of Melibee,
he seyde hem thise wordes: / 'it standeth thus,' quod Melibee, 'and sooth
it is, that ye, / causeless, and with-outen skile and resoun, /3000 han
doon grete iniuries and wronges to me and to my wyf Prudence, and to my
doghter also. / For ye han entred in-to myn hous by violence, / and have
doon swich outrage, that alle men knowen wel that ye have deserved the
deeth; / and therfore wol I knowe and wite of yow, / whether ye wol putte
the punissement and the chastysinge and the vengeance of this outrage in

'sire,' quod he, 'we knowen wel, that we been unworthy to comen un-to the
court of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been. / For we han so greetly
mistaken us, and han offended and agilt in swich a wyse agayn your heigh

bisekinge yow, that of your merciable pitee ye wol [238] considere our
grete repentaunce and lowe submissioun, / and graunten us foryevenesse of

grace and mercy strecchen hem ferther in-to goodnesse, than doon our

borwes, / and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne un-to his court, / for
to accepte and receyve the sentence and Iugement that Melibee wolde comande
to be doon on hem by the causes afore-seyd; /3020 whiche thinges ordeyned,

§ 75. And whan that dame Prudence saugh hir tyme, she freyned and axed hir

§ 76. To which Melibee answerde and seyde, 'certes,' quod he, 'I thinke and
purpose me fully / to desherite hem of al that ever they han, and for to
putte hem in exil for ever.' /3025

§ 77. 'Certes,' quod dame Prudence, 'this were a cruel sentence, and muchel
agayn resoun. / For ye been riche y-nough, and han no nede of other mennes
good; / and ye mighte lightly in this wyse gete yow a coveitous name, /
which is a vicious thing, and oghte been eschewed of every good man. / For
after the sawe of the word of the apostle: "coveitise is rote of alle
harmes." /3030 And therfore, it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good
of your owene, than for to taken of hir good in this manere. / For bettre
it is to lesen good with worshipe, than it is to winne good with vileinye
and shame. / And every man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisinesse to
geten him a good name. / And yet shal he nat only bisie him in kepinge of
his good name, / but he shal also enforcen him alwey to do som-thing by
which he may renovelle his good name; /3035 for it is writen, that "the
olde good loos or good name of a man is sone goon and passed, whan it is
nat newed ne renovelled." / And as touchinge that ye seyn, ye wole exile
your adversaries, / that thinketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure,
/ considered the power that they han yeve yow [239] up-on hem-self. / And
it is writen, that "he is worthy to lesen his privilege that misuseth the
might and the power that is yeven him." /3040 And I sette cas ye mighte
enioyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe, / which I trowe ye mowe nat
do, / I seye, ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun per-aventure, / and
thanne were it lykly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn. / And
therfore, if ye wole that men do yow obeisance, ye moste demen more
curteisly; /3045 this is to seyn, ye moste yeven more esy sentences and
Iugements. / For it is writen, that "he that most curteisly comandeth, to
him men most obeyen." / And therfore, I prey yow that in this necessitee
and in this nede, ye caste yow to overcome your herte. / For Senek seith:
that "he that overcometh his herte, overcometh twyes." / And Tullius seith:
"ther is nothing so comendable in a greet lord /3050 as whan he is
debonaire and meke, and appeseth him lightly." / And I prey yow that ye
wole forbere now to do vengeance, / in swich a manere, that your goode name
may be kept and conserved; / and that men mowe have cause and matere to
preyse yow of pitee and of mercy; / and that ye have no cause to repente
yow of thing that ye doon. /3055 For Senek seith: "he overcometh in an yvel
manere, that repenteth him of his victorie." / Wherfore I pray yow, lat
mercy been in your minde and in your herte, / to theffect and entente that
god almighty have mercy on yow in his laste Iugement. / For seint Iame

Prudence, and hir wise informaciouns and techinges, /3060 his herte gan
enclyne to the wil of his wyf, consideringe hir trewe entente; / and
conformed him anon, and assented fully to werken after hir conseil; / and
thonked god, of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse, that him sente

trespassed un-to me; / yet, for as much as I see and biholde your grete
humilitee, / and that ye [240] been sory and repentant of your giltes, / it
constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy. /3070 Therfore I receyve yow
to my grace, / and foryeve yow outrely alle the offences, iniuries, and
wronges, that ye have doon agayn me and myne; / to this effect and to this
ende, that god of his endelees mercy / wole at the tyme of our dyinge
foryeven us our giltes that we han trespassed to him in this wrecched
world. / For doutelees, if we be sory and repentant of the sinnes and
giltes whiche we han trespassed in the sighte of our lord god, /3075 he is
so free and so merciable, / that he wole foryeven us our giltes, / and

  Whan ended was my tale of Melibee,
  And of Prudence and hir benignitee,                         3080
  Our hoste seyde, 'as I am faithful man,
  And by the precious _corpus Madrian_,
  I hadde lever than a barel ale
  That goode lief my wyf hadde herd this tale!
  For she nis no-thing of swich pacience                      3085
  As was this Melibeus wyf Prudence.
  By goddes bones! whan I bete my knaves,
  She bringth me forth the grete clobbed staves,              (10)
  And cryeth, "slee the dogges everichoon,
  And brek hem, bothe bak and every boon."                    3090
  And if that any neighebor of myne
  Wol nat in chirche to my wyf enclyne,
  Or be so hardy to hir to trespace,
  Whan she comth hoom, she rampeth in my face,
  And cryeth, "false coward, wreek thy wyf,                   3095
  By _corpus_ bones! I wol have thy knyf,
  And thou shalt have my distaf and go spinne!"
  Fro day to night right thus she wol biginne;--              (20)
  "Allas!" she seith, "that ever I was shape
  To wedde a milksop or a coward ape,                         3100
  That wol be overlad with every wight!
  Thou darst nat stonden by thy wyves right!"
  This is my lyf, but-if that I wol fighte;
  And out at dore anon I moot me dighte,
  Or elles I am but lost, but-if that I                       3105
  Be lyk a wilde leoun fool-hardy.
  I woot wel she wol do me slee som day
  Som neighebor, and thanne go my wey.                        (30)
  [242: T. 13925-13962.]
  For I am perilous with knyf in honde,
  Al be it that I dar nat hir withstonde,                     3110
  For she is big in armes, by my feith,
  That shal he finde, that hir misdooth or seith.
  But lat us passe awey fro this matere.

  Lo! Rouchestre stant heer faste by!

  Upon my feith, thou art som officer,                        3125
  Som worthy sexteyn, or som celerer,
  For by my fader soule, as to my doom,
  Thou art a maister whan thou art at hoom;                   (50)
  No povre cloisterer, ne no novys,

  And therwithal of brawnes and of bones
  A wel-faring persone for the nones.

  That first thee broghte un-to religioun;
  Thou woldest han been a trede-foul aright.                  3135
  Haddestow as greet a leve, as thou hast might
  To parfourne al thy lust in engendrure,
  Thou haddest bigeten many a creature.                       (60)
  Alas! why werestow so wyd a cope?
  God yeve me sorwe! but, and I were a pope,                  3140
  Not only thou, but every mighty man,
  Thogh he were shorn ful hye upon his pan,
  Sholde have a wyf; for al the world is lorn!
  Religioun hath take up al the corn
  Of treding, and we borel men ben shrimpes!                  3145
  Of feble trees ther comen wrecched impes.

  This maketh that our heires been so sclendre

  Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde.

  At Lucifer, though he an angel were,
  And nat a man, at him I wol biginne;                        3190
  For, thogh fortune may non angel dere,                      (11)

  With goddes owene finger wroght was he,
  And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene,
  And welte al Paradys, saving o tree.                        3200

              SAMPSON.

  Lo Sampson, which that was annunciat                        3205
  By thangel, longe er his nativitee,
  And was to god almighty consecrat,
  And stood in noblesse, whyl he mighte see.
  Was never swich another as was he,
  To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardinesse;             3210
  But to his wyves tolde he his secree,                       (31)
  Through which he slow him-self, for wrecchednesse.

    3206. Hl. Cp. thangel; Hn. Pt. Ln. the aungel; E. Cm. angel.

  Sampson, this noble almighty champioun,
  Withouten wepen save his hondes tweye,
  He slow and al to-rente the leoun,                          3215
  Toward his wedding walking by the weye.
  His false wyf coude him so plese and preye
  Til she his conseil knew, and she untrewe
  Un-to his foos his conseil gan biwreye,
  And him forsook, and took another newe.                     3220

  Three hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,                   (41)
  And alle hir tayles he togider bond,
  And sette the foxes tayles alle on fire,
  For he on every tayl had knit a brond;
  And they brende alle the cornes in that lond,               3225
  And alle hir oliveres and vynes eek.
  A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,
  And had no wepen but an asses cheek.

  Whan they were slayn, so thursted him that he
  Was wel my lorn, for which he gan to preye                  3230
  That god wolde on his peyne han som pitee,                  (51)
  And sende him drinke, or elles moste he deye;
  [246: T. 14049-14080.]
  And of this asses cheke, that was dreye,
  Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle,
  Of which he drank y-nogh, shortly to seye,                  3235
  Thus heelp him god, as _Iudicum_ can telle.

    3235. E. anon; _rest_ ynogh, ynough, ynouhe, &c.

  By verray force, at Gazan, on a night,
  Maugree Philistiens of that citee,
  The gates of the toun he hath up-plight,
  And on his bak y-caried hem hath he                         3240
  Hye on an hille, that men mighte hem see.                   (61)
  O noble almighty Sampson, leef and dere,
  Had thou nat told to wommen thy secree,
  In al this worlde ne hadde been thy pere!

  This Sampson never sicer drank ne wyn,                      3245
  Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne shere,
  By precept of the messager divyn,
  For alle his strengthes in his heres were;
  And fully twenty winter, yeer by yere,
  He hadde of Israel the governaunce.                         3250
  But sone shal he wepen many a tere,                         (71)

  And sleping in hir barme up-on a day
  She made to clippe or shere his heer awey,
  And made his fo-men al his craft espyen;
  And whan that they him fonde in this array,
  They bounde him faste, and putten out his yën.              3260

  But now is he in prisoun in a cave,
  Wher-as they made him at the querne grinde.
  [247: T. 14081-14112.]
  O noble Sampson, strongest of mankinde,                     3265
  O whylom Iuge in glorie and in richesse,
  Now maystow wepen with thyn yën blinde,

  And made him as hir fool bifore hem pleye,                  (91)
  And this was in a temple of greet array.
  But atte laste he made a foul affray;
  For he two pilers shook, and made hem falle,
  And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay,                3275
  And slow him-self, and eek his fo-men alle.

  Of Sampson now wol I na-more seyn.                          3280
  Beth war by this ensample old and playn                    (101)

  Of swich thing as they wolde han secree fayn,
  If that it touche hir limmes or hir lyves.

              HERCULES.

  Of Hercules the sovereyn conquerour                         3285
  Singen his workes laude and heigh renoun;
  For in his tyme of strengthe he was the flour.
  He slow, and rafte the skin of the leoun;
  He of Centauros leyde the boost adoun;
  He Arpies slow, the cruel briddes felle;                    3290
  He golden apples rafte of the dragoun;                     (111)
  He drow out Cerberus, the hound of helle:

  He slow the cruel tyrant Busirus,
  And made his hors to frete him, flesh and boon;
  He slow the firy serpent venimous;                          3295
  Of Achelois two hornes, he brak oon;
  [248: T. 14113-14148.]
  And he slow Cacus in a cave of stoon;
  He slow the geaunt Antheus the stronge;
  He slow the grisly boor, and that anoon,
  And bar the heven on his nekke longe.                       3300

    3294. E. flessh.   3296. E. Cm. hornes two; _rest_ two hornes.

  Was never wight, sith that the world bigan,                (121)
  That slow so many monstres as dide he.
  Thurgh-out this wyde world his name ran,
  What for his strengthe, and for his heigh bountee,
  And every reaume wente he for to see.                       3305
  He was so strong that no man mighte him lette;
  At bothe the worldes endes, seith Trophee,
  In stede of boundes, he a piler sette.

    3308. E. stide; pileer.

  A lemman hadde this noble champioun,
  That highte Dianira, fresh as May;                          3310
  And, as thise clerkes maken mencioun,                      (131)
  She hath him sent a sherte fresh and gay.
  Allas! this sherte, allas and weylaway!
  Envenimed was so subtilly with-alle,
  That, er that he had wered it half a day,                   3315
  It made his flesh al from his bones falle.

  But nathelees somme clerkes hir excusen

  Be as be may, I wol hir noght accusen;
  But on his bak this sherte he wered al naked,               3320
  Til that his flesh was for the venim blaked.               (141)
  And whan he sey noon other remedye,
  In hote coles he hath him-selven raked,
  For with no venim deyned him to dye.

  Thus starf this worthy mighty Hercules;                     3325
  Lo, who may truste on fortune any throwe?
  For him that folweth al this world of prees,
  Er he be war, is ofte y-leyd ful lowe.
  Ful wys is he that can him-selven knowe.
  Beth war, for whan that fortune list to glose,              3330
  Than wayteth she hir man to overthrowe                     (151)

  And lyk a beste him semed for to be,                       (181)

  And, til that tyme he leyd was on his bere,                (191)

  That heeld the regne after his fader day,
  He by his fader coude nought be war,                        3375
  For proud he was of herte and of array;
  And eek an ydolastre was he ay.

  Thou shalt be dreynt; my tale is at an ende.'
  He wook, and tolde his felawe what he mette,
  And preyde him his viage for to lette;
  As for that day, he preyde him to abyde.                    4275
  His felawe, that lay by his beddes syde,
  Gan for to laughe, and scorned him ful faste.

  For he had founde a corn, lay in the yerd.                  4365
  Royal he was, he was namore aferd;
  He fethered Pertelote twenty tyme,
  And trad as ofte, er that it was pryme.
  He loketh as it were a grim leoun;
  And on his toos he rometh up and doun,                      4370
  Him deyned not to sette his foot to grounde.               (361)
  He chukketh, whan he hath a corn y-founde,
  And to him rennen thanne his wyves alle.
  Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle,
  Leve I this Chauntecleer in his pasture;                    4375
  And after wol I telle his aventure.

  Caste up his eyen to the brighte sonne,
  That in the signe of Taurus hadde y-ronne
  Twenty degrees and oon, and somwhat more;                   4385
  And knew by kynde, and by noon other lore,
  That it was pryme, and crew with blisful stevene.

  That in the grove hadde woned yeres three,
  By heigh imaginacioun forn-cast,
  The same night thurgh-out the hegges brast
  Into the yerd, ther Chauntecleer the faire
  Was wont, and eek his wyves, to repaire;                    4410
  And in a bed of wortes stille he lay,                      (401)
  Til it was passed undern of the day,
  Wayting his tyme on Chauntecleer to falle,
  As gladly doon thise homicydes alle,
  That in awayt liggen to mordre men.                         4415
  O false mordrer, lurking in thy den!
  O newe Scariot, newe Genilon!

  O Chauntecleer, acursed be that morwe,                      4420
  That thou into that yerd flough fro the bemes!             (411)

  And so bifel that, as he caste his yë,
  Among the wortes, on a boterflye,
  He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe.                   4465
  No-thing ne liste him thanne for to crowe,
  But cryde anon, 'cok, cok,' and up he sterte,
  As man that was affrayed in his herte.

  Seyde, 'Gentil sire, allas! wher wol ye gon?
  Be ye affrayed of me that am your freend?                   4475
  Now certes, I were worse than a feend,
  If I to yow wolde harm or vileinye.

  But trewely, the cause of my cominge
  Was only for to herkne how that ye singe.                   4480
  For trewely ye have as mery a stevene                      (471)
  As eny aungel hath, that is in hevene;
  Therwith ye han in musik more felinge

  And eek your moder, of hir gentilesse,
  Han in myn hous y-been, to my gret ese;
  And certes, sire, ful fayn wolde I yow plese.
  But for men speke of singing, I wol saye,
  So mote I brouke wel myn eyen tweye,                        4490
  Save yow, I herde never man so singe,                      (48l)
  As dide your fader in the morweninge;
  Certes, it was of herte, al that he song.
  And for to make his voys the more strong,
  He wolde so peyne him, that with bothe his yën              4495
  He moste winke, so loude he wolde cryen,
  And stonden on his tiptoon ther-with-al,
  And strecche forth his nekke long and smal.
  And eek he was of swich discrecioun,
  That ther nas no man in no regioun                          4500
  That him in song or wisdom mighte passe.                   (491)
  I have wel rad in daun Burnel the Asse,
  Among his vers, how that ther was a cok,
  For that a preestes sone yaf him a knok
  Upon his leg, whyl he was yong and nyce,                    4505
  He made him for to lese his benefyce.
  [285: T. 15323-15359.]
  But certeyn, ther nis no comparisoun
  Bitwix the wisdom and discrecioun
  Of youre fader, and of his subtiltee.
  Now singeth, sire, for seinte charitee,                     4510

    This Chauntecleer stood hye up-on his toos,              (511)
  Strecching his nekke, and heeld his eyen cloos,
  And gan to crowe loude for the nones;
  And daun Russel the fox sterte up at ones,
  And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer,                       4525

  More for delyt, than world to multiplye,                    4535
  Why woldestow suffre him on thy day to dye?
  O Gaufred, dere mayster soverayn,

  And Malkin, with a distaf in hir hand;

  'Sir Nonnes Preest,' our hoste seyde anoon,
  'Y-blessed be thy breche, and every stoon!
  This was a mery tale of Chauntecleer.
  But, by my trouthe, if thou were seculer,                   4640
  Thou woldest been a trede-foul a-right.
  For, if thou have corage as thou hast might,
  Thee were nede of hennes, as I wene,
  Ya, mo than seven tymes seventene.
  See, whiche braunes hath this gentil Preest,                4645
  So greet a nekke, and swich a large breest!                 (10)
  He loketh as a sperhauk with his yën;
  Him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen
  With brasil, ne with greyn of Portingale.
  Now sire, faire falle yow for youre tale!'                  4650

    And after that he, with ful mery chere,
  Seide to another, as ye shullen here.

      Sire Doctour of Phisyk, I preye yow,
      Telle us a tale of som honest matere.'
        'It shal be doon, if that ye wol it here,'

  HERE FOLWETH THE PHISICIENS TALE.

  Ther was, as telleth Titus Livius,
  A knight that called was Virginius,
  Fulfild of honour and of worthinesse,
  And strong of freendes and of greet richesse.

    2. Hn. called was; E. was called; _rest_ cleped was.

    This knight a doghter hadde by his wyf,                      5
  No children hadde he mo in al his lyf.
  Fair was this mayde in excellent beautee
  Aboven every wight that man may see;
  For nature hath with sovereyn diligence
  Y-formed hir in so greet excellence,                          10
  As though she wolde seyn, 'lo! I, Nature,
  Thus can I forme and peynte a creature,
  Whan that me list; who can me countrefete?
  Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge and bete,
  Or grave, or peynte; for I dar wel seyn,                      15
  Apelles, Zanzis, sholde werche in veyn,
  Outher to grave or peynte or forge or bete,
  If they presumed me to countrefete.
  For he that is the former principal
  Hath maked me his vicaire general,                            20
  To forme and peynten erthely creaturis
  Right as me list, and ech thing in my cure is
  Under the mone, that may wane and waxe,
  [291: T. 11958-11993.]
  And for my werk right no-thing wol I axe;
  My lord and I ben ful of oon accord;                          25
  I made hir to the worship of my lord.
  So do I alle myne othere creatures,
  What colour that they han, or what figures.'--
  Thus semeth me that Nature wolde seye.

    16. E. Hn. Apelles; Hl. Appollus; rest Apollus.   E. Hn. Zanzis; rest
    zephirus (!).   25. E. Hn. ful of oon; _rest_ fully at.

    This mayde of age twelf yeer was and tweye,                 30
  In which that Nature hadde swich delyt.
  For right as she can peynte a lilie whyt
  And reed a rose, right with swich peynture
  She peynted hath this noble creature
  Er she were born, up-on hir limes free,                       35
  Wher-as by right swiche colours sholde be;
  And Phebus dyed hath hir tresses grete
  Lyk to the stremes of his burned hete.
  And if that excellent was hir beautee,
  A thousand-fold more vertuous was she.                        40
  In hir ne lakked no condicioun,
  That is to preyse, as by discrecioun.
  As wel in goost as body chast was she;
  For which she floured in virginitee
  With alle humilitee and abstinence,                           45
  With alle attemperaunce and pacience,
  With mesure eek of bering and array.
  Discreet she was in answering alway;
  Though she were wys as Pallas, dar I seyn,
  Hir facound eek ful wommanly and pleyn,                       50
  No countrefeted termes hadde she
  To seme wys; but after hir degree
  She spak, and alle hir wordes more and lesse
  Souninge in vertu and in gentillesse.
  Shamfast she was in maydens shamfastnesse,                    55
  Constant in herte, and ever in bisinesse
  To dryve hir out of ydel slogardye.
  Bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrye;
  For wyn and youthe doon Venus encrece,
  [292: T. 11994-12028.]
  As men in fyr wol casten oile or grece.                       60
  And of hir owene vertu, unconstreyned,
  She hath ful ofte tyme syk hir feyned,
  For that she wolde fleen the companye
  Wher lykly was to treten of folye,
  As is at festes, revels, and at daunces,                      65
  That been occasions of daliaunces.
  Swich thinges maken children for to be
  To sone rype and bold, as men may see,
  Which is ful perilous, and hath ben yore.
  For al to sone may she lerne lore                             70
  Of boldnesse, whan she woxen is a wyf.

  Loke wel that ye un-to no vice assente,
  Lest ye be dampned for your wikke entente;
  For who-so doth, a traitour is certeyn.
  And taketh kepe of that that I shal seyn;                     90

    This mayde, of which I wol this tale expresse,             105
  So kepte hir-self, hir neded no maistresse;
  For in hir living maydens mighten rede,
  As in a book, every good word or dede,
  That longeth to a mayden vertuous;
  She was so prudent and so bountevous.                        110
  For which the fame out-sprong on every syde
  Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde;
  That thurgh that land they preysed hir echone,
  That loved vertu, save envye allone,
  That sory is of other mennes wele,                           115
  And glad is of his sorwe and his unhele;
  (The doctour maketh this descripcioun).
  This mayde up-on a day wente in the toun
  Toward a temple, with hir moder dere,
  As is of yonge maydens the manere.                           120

    105. E. Hn. I wol this; _rest_ I telle my.   119. E. Hn. a; _rest_ the.

    Now was ther thanne a Iustice in that toun,
  That governour was of that regioun.
  And so bifel, this Iuge his eyen caste
  Up-on this mayde, avysinge him ful faste,
  As she cam forby ther this Iuge stood.                       125
  Anon his herte chaunged and his mood,
  So was he caught with beautee of this mayde;
  And to him-self ful prively he sayde,
  'This mayde shal be myn, for any man.'

    125. E. Hn. ther as; _rest om._ as.

[294: T. 12064-12100.]

    Anon the feend in-to his herte ran,                        130
  And taughte him sodeynly, that he by slighte
  The mayden to his purpos winne mighte.
  For certes, by no force, ne by no mede,
  Him thoughte, he was nat able for to spede;
  For she was strong of freendes, and eek she                  135
  Confermed was in swich soverayn bountee,
  That wel he wiste he mighte hir never winne
  As for to make hir with hir body sinne.
  For which, by greet deliberacioun,
  He sente after a cherl, was in the toun,                     140
  Which that he knew for subtil and for bold.
  This Iuge un-to this cherl his tale hath told
  In secree wyse, and made him to ensure,
  He sholde telle it to no creature,
  And if he dide, he sholde lese his heed.                     145
  Whan that assented was this cursed reed,
  Glad was this Iuge and maked him greet chere,
  And yaf hym yiftes preciouse and dere.

    Whan shapen was al hir conspiracye
  Fro point to point, how that his lecherye                    150
  Parfourned sholde been ful subtilly,
  As ye shul here it after openly,
  Hoom gooth the cherl, that highte Claudius.
  This false Iuge that highte Apius,
  So was his name, (for this is no fable,                      155
  But knowen for historial thing notable,
  The sentence of it sooth is, out of doute),
  This false Iuge gooth now faste aboute
  To hasten his delyt al that he may.
  And so bifel sone after, on a day,                           160
  This false Iuge, as telleth us the storie,
  As he was wont, sat in his consistorie,
  And yaf his domes up-on sondry cas.
  This false cherl cam forth a ful greet pas,
  And seyde, 'lord, if that it be your wille,                  165
  As dooth me right up-on this pitous bille,
  [295: T. 12101-12136.]
  In which I pleyne up-on Virginius.
  And if that he wol seyn it is nat thus,
  I wol it preve, and finde good witnesse,
  That sooth is that my bille wol expresse.'                   170

    155. E. Hn. this; _rest_ it.

    The Iuge answerde, 'of this, in his absence,
  I may nat yeve diffinitif sentence.
  Lat do him calle, and I wol gladly here;
  Thou shall have al right, and no wrong here.'

    172. E. diffynyue; rest diffinitif.   173, 174. E. heere, glossed

    Virginius cam, to wite the Iuges wille,                    175
  And right anon was rad this cursed bille;
  The sentence of it was as ye shul here.

    'To yow, my lord, sire Apius so dere,
  Sheweth your povre servant Claudius,
  How that a knight, called Virginius,                         180
  Agayns the lawe, agayn al equitee,
  Holdeth, expres agayn the wil of me,
  My servant, which that is my thral by right,
  Which fro myn hous was stole up-on a night,
  Whyl that she was ful yong; this wol I preve                 185
  By witnesse, lord, so that it nat yow greve.
  She nis his doghter nat, what so he seye;
  Wherfore to yow, my lord the Iuge, I preye,
  Yeld me my thral, if that it be your wille.'
  Lo! this was al the sentence of his bille.                   190

    Virginius gan up-on the cherl biholde,
  But hastily, er he his tale tolde,
  And wolde have preved it, as sholde a knight,
  And eek by witnessing of many a wight,
  That it was fals that seyde his adversarie,                  195
  This cursed Iuge wolde no-thing tarie,
  Ne here a word more of Virginius,
  But yaf his Iugement, and seyde thus:--

    191. E. Hn. Cm. cherl; rest clerk.

    'I deme anon this cherl his servant have;
  Thou shalt no lenger in thyn hous hir save.                  200
  Go bring hir forth, and put hir in our warde,
  The cherl shal have his thral, this I awarde.'

    199, 202. E. Hn. Cm. cherl; rest clerk.

[296: T. 12137-12173.]

    And whan this worthy knight Virginius,
  Thurgh sentence of this Iustice Apius,
  Moste by force his dere doghter yiven                        205
  Un-to the Iuge, in lecherye to liven,
  He gooth him hoom, and sette him in his halle,
  And leet anon his dere doghter calle,
  And, with a face deed as asshen colde,
  Upon hir humble face he gan biholde,                         210
  With fadres pitee stiking thurgh his herte,
  Al wolde he from his purpos nat converte.

  That thou most suffre; allas! that I was bore!               215
  For never thou deservedest wherfore
  To dyen with a swerd or with a knyf.
  O dere doghter, ender of my lyf,
  Which I have fostred up with swich plesaunce,
  That thou were never out of my remembraunce!                 220
  O doghter, which that art my laste wo,
  And in my lyf my laste Ioye also,
  O gemme of chastitee, in pacience
  Take thou thy deeth, for this is my sentence.
  For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed;                225
  My pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed.
  Allas! that ever Apius thee say!
  Thus hath he falsly Iuged thee to-day'--

    223. E. o; rest of.

    'O mercy, dere fader,' quod this mayde,
  And with that word she both hir armes layde
  About his nekke, as she was wont to do:
  The teres broste out of hir eyen two,
  And seyde, 'gode fader, shal I dye?                          235
  Is ther no grace? is ther no remedye?'

  For pardee, Iepte yaf his doghter grace                      240
  For to compleyne, er he hir slow, allas!
  And god it woot, no-thing was hir trespas,
  But for she ran hir fader first to see,
  To welcome him with greet solempnitee.'
  And with that word she fil aswowne anon,                     245
  And after, whan hir swowning is agon,
  She ryseth up, and to hir fader sayde,
  'Blessed be god, that I shal dye a mayde.
  Yif me my deeth, er that I have a shame;
  Doth with your child your wil, a goddes name!'               250

    And with that word she preyed him ful ofte,

  And with that word aswowne doun she fil.

  And to the Iuge he gan it to presente,
  As he sat yet in doom in consistorie.
  And whan the Iuge it saugh, as seith the storie,
  He bad to take him and anhange him faste.
  But right anon a thousand peple in thraste,                  260
  To save the knight, for routhe and for pitee,
  For knowen was the false iniquitee.
  The peple anon hath suspect of this thing,
  By manere of the cherles chalanging,
  That it was by the assent of Apius;                          265
  They wisten wel that he was lecherous.
  For which un-to this Apius they gon,
  And caste him in a prison right anon,
  Wher-as he slow him-self; and Claudius,
  That servant was un-to this Apius,                           270
  Was demed for to hange upon a tree;
  But that Virginius, of his pitee,
  So preyde for him that he was exyled;
  And elles, certes, he had been bigyled.
  [298: T. 12209-12220.]

  Thou bel amy, thou Pardoner,' he seyde,
  'Tel us som mirthe or Iapes right anon.'
  'It shall be doon,' quod he, 'by seint Ronyon!               320
  But first,' quod he, 'heer at this ale-stake

  HERE FOLWETH THE PROLOGE OF THE PARDONERS TALE.

  _Radix malorum est Cupiditas: Ad Thimotheum, sexto._

  'Lordings,' quod he, 'in chirches whan I preche,
  I peyne me to han an hauteyn speche,                         330
  And ringe it out as round as gooth a belle,
  For I can al by rote that I telle.
  My theme is alwey oon, and ever was--
  "_Radix malorum est Cupiditas_."

    First I pronounce whennes that I come,                     335
  And than my bulles shewe I, alle and somme.
  Our lige lordes seel on my patente,
  That shewe I first, my body to warente,                     (10)
  That no man be so bold, ne preest ne clerk,
  Me to destourbe of Cristes holy werk;                        340
  And after that than telle I forth my tales,
  Bulles of popes and of cardinales,
  Of patriarkes, and bishoppes I shewe;
  And in Latyn I speke a wordes fewe,
  To saffron with my predicacioun,                             345
  And for to stire men to devocioun.
  Than shewe I forth my longe cristal stones,
  Y-crammed ful of cloutes and of bones;                      (20)
  Reliks been they, as wenen they echoon.
  Than have I in latoun a sholder-boon                         350
  Which that was of an holy Iewes shepe.
  "Good men," seye I, "tak of my wordes kepe;
  If that this boon be wasshe in any welle,
  If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swelle
  [302: T. 12289-12324.]
  That any worm hath ete, or worm y-stonge,                    355
  Tak water of that welle, and wash his tonge,
  And it is hool anon; and forthermore,
  Of pokkes and of scabbe, and every sore                     (30)
  Shal every sheep be hool, that of this welle
  Drinketh a draughte; tak kepe eek what I telle.              360
  If that the good-man, that the bestes oweth,
  Wol every wike, er that the cok him croweth,
  Fastinge, drinken of this welle a draughte,
  As thilke holy Iewe our eldres taughte,
  His bestes and his stoor shal multiplye.                     565
  And, sirs, also it heleth Ialousye;
  For, though a man be falle in Ialous rage,
  Let maken with this water his potage,                       (40)
  And never shal he more his wyf mistriste,
  Though he the sooth of hir defaute wiste;                    370
  Al had she taken preestes two or three.

  So that he offre pens, or elles grotes.

    Good men and wommen, o thing warne I yow,
  If any wight be in this chirche now,                        (50)
  That hath doon sinne horrible, that he
  Dar nat, for shame, of it y-shriven be,                      380
  Or any womman, be she yong or old,
  That hath y-maad hir housbond cokewold,
  Swich folk shul have no power ne no grace
  To offren to my reliks in this place.
  And who-so findeth him out of swich blame,                   385
  He wol com up and offre in goddes name,
  And I assoille him by the auctoritee
  Which that by bulle y-graunted was to me."                  (60)

    By this gaude have I wonne, yeer by yeer,
  An hundred mark sith I was Pardoner.                         390
  [303: T. 12325-12361.]
  I stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet,
  And whan the lewed peple is doun y-set,
  I preche, so as ye han herd bifore,
  And telle an hundred false Iapes more.
  Than peyne I me to strecche forth the nekke,                 395
  And est and west upon the peple I bekke,
  As doth a dowve sitting on a berne.
  Myn hondes and my tonge goon so yerne,                      (70)
  That it is Ioye to see my bisinesse.
  Of avaryce and of swich cursednesse                          400
  Is al my preching, for to make hem free
  To yeve her pens, and namely un-to me.
  For my entente is nat but for to winne,
  And no-thing for correccioun of sinne.
  I rekke never, whan that they ben beried,                    405
  Though that her soules goon a-blakeberied!
  For certes, many a predicacioun
  Comth ofte tyme of yvel entencioun;                         (80)
  Som for plesaunce of folk and flaterye,
  To been avaunced by ipocrisye,                               410
  And som for veyne glorie, and som for hate.
  For, whan I dar non other weyes debate,
  Than wol I stinge him with my tonge smerte
  In preching, so that he shal nat asterte
  To been defamed falsly, if that he                           415
  Hath trespased to my brethren or to me.
  For, though I telle noght his propre name,
  Men shal wel knowe that it is the same                      (90)
  By signes and by othere circumstances.
  Thus quyte I folk that doon us displesances;                 420
  Thus spitte I out my venim under hewe
  Of holynesse, to seme holy and trewe.

    395. the] Cm. myn; Cp. Ln. Hl. my.   405. E. Hl. _omit_ that.

    But shortly myn entente I wol devyse;
  I preche of no-thing but for coveityse.
  Therfor my theme is yet, and ever was--                      425
  "_Radix malorum est cupiditas_."
  Thus can I preche agayn that same vyce
  [304: T. 12362-12396.]
  Which that I use, and that is avaryce.                     (100)
  But, though my-self be gilty in that sinne,
  Yet can I maken other folk to twinne                         430
  From avaryce, and sore to repente.
  But that is nat my principal entente.
  I preche no-thing but for coveityse;
  Of this matere it oughte y-nogh suffyse.

    425. E. Hn. theme; _rest_ teme (teem).

    Than telle I hem ensamples many oon                        435
  Of olde stories, longe tyme agoon:
  For lewed peple loven tales olde;
  Swich thinges can they wel reporte and holde.              (110)
  What? trowe ye, the whyles I may preche,
  And winne gold and silver for I teche,                       440
  That I wol live in povert wilfully?
  Nay, nay, I thoghte it never trewely!
  For I wol preche and begge in sondry londes;
  I wol not do no labour with myn hondes,
  Ne make baskettes, and live therby,                          445
  Because I wol nat beggen ydelly.
  I wol non of the apostles counterfete;
  I wol have money, wolle, chese, and whete,                 (120)
  Al were it yeven of the povrest page,
  Or of the povrest widwe in a village,                        450
  Al sholde hir children sterve for famyne.
  Nay! I wol drinke licour of the vyne,
  And have a Ioly wenche in every toun.
  But herkneth, lordings, in conclusioun;
  Your lyking is that I shal telle a tale.                     455
  Now, have I dronke a draughte of corny ale,
  By god, I hope I shal yow telle a thing
  That shal, by resoun, been at your lyking.                 (130)
  For, though myself be a ful vicious man,
  A moral tale yet I yow telle can,                            460
  Which I am wont to preche, for to winne.
  Now holde your pees, my tale I wol beginne.

  HERE BIGINNETH THE PARDONERS TALE.

  In Flaundres whylom was a companye
  Of yonge folk, that haunteden folye,
  As ryot, hasard, stewes, and tavernes,                       465
  Wher-as, with harpes, lutes, and giternes,
  They daunce and pleye at dees bothe day and night,
  And ete also and drinken over hir might,                   (140)
  Thurgh which they doon the devel sacrifyse
  With-in that develes temple, in cursed wyse,                 470
  By superfluitee abhominable;
  Hir othes been so grete and so dampnable,
  That it is grisly for to here hem swere;
  Our blissed lordes body they to-tere;
  Hem thoughte Iewes rente him noght y-nough;                  475
  And ech of hem at otheres sinne lough.
  And right anon than comen tombesteres
  Fetys and smale, and yonge fruytesteres,                   (150)
  Singers with harpes, baudes, wafereres,
  Whiche been the verray develes officeres                     480
  To kindle and blowe the fyr of lecherye,
  That is annexed un-to glotonye;
  The holy writ take I to my witnesse,
  That luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse.

    HEADING; _from_ E. Hn.   465. E. Hl. stywes.   475. _So_ Cp. Ln. Hl.;

    Lo, how that dronken Loth, unkindely,                      485
  Lay by his doghtres two, unwitingly;
  So dronke he was, he niste what he wroghte.

    Herodes, (who-so wel the stories soghte),                (160)
  [306: T. 12423-12459.]
  Whan he of wyn was replet at his feste,
  Right at his owene table he yaf his heste                    490
  To sleen the Baptist Iohn ful giltelees.

  Bitwix a man that is out of his minde
  And a man which that is dronkelewe,                          495
  But that woodnesse, y-fallen in a shrewe,
  Persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse.
  O glotonye, ful of cursednesse,                            (170)
  O cause first of our confusioun,
  O original of our dampnacioun,                               500
  Til Crist had boght us with his blood agayn!
  Lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn,
  Aboght was thilke cursed vileinye;
  Corrupt was al this world for glotonye!

    Adam our fader, and his wyf also,                          505
  Fro Paradys to labour and to wo
  Were driven for that vyce, it is no drede;
  For whyl that Adam fasted, as I rede,                      (180)
  He was in Paradys; and whan that he
  Eet of the fruyt defended on the tree,                       510
  Anon he was out-cast to wo and peyne.
  O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!
  O, wiste a man how many maladyes
  Folwen of excesse and of glotonyes,
  He wolde been the more mesurable                             515
  Of his diete, sittinge at his table.
  Allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,
  Maketh that, Est and West, and North and South,            (190)
  In erthe, in eir, in water men to-swinke
  To gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drinke!                   520
  Of this matere, o Paul, wel canstow trete,
  'Mete un-to wombe, and wombe eek un-to mete,
  Shal god destroyen bothe,' as Paulus seith.
  Allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith,
  To seye this word, and fouler is the dede,                   525
  [307: T. 12460-12496.]
  Whan man so drinketh of the whyte and rede,
  That of his throte he maketh his privee,
  Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.                         (200)

    519. E. Hl. man; _rest_ men.

    The apostel weping seith ful pitously,
  'Ther walken many of whiche yow told have I,                 530
  I seye it now weping with pitous voys,
  That they been enemys of Cristes croys,
  Of whiche the ende is deeth, wombe is her god.'
  O wombe! O bely! O stinking cod,
  Fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun!                         535
  At either ende of thee foul is the soun.
  How greet labour and cost is thee to finde!
  Thise cokes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde,     (210)
  And turnen substaunce in-to accident,
  To fulfille al thy likerous talent!                          540
  Out of the harde bones knokke they
  The mary, for they caste noght a-wey
  That may go thurgh the golet softe and swote;
  Of spicerye, of leef, and bark, and rote
  Shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt,                        545
  To make him yet a newer appetyt.
  But certes, he that haunteth swich delyces
  Is deed, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces.                 (220)

    532. That they _is_ Tyrwhitt's _reading_; Hl. Thay; _but the rest have_
    Ther, _probably repeated by mistake from_ l. 530.   534. Hl. o stynking
    is thi cod.

    A lecherous thing is wyn, and dronkenesse
  Is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse.                     550
  O dronke man, disfigured is thy face,
  Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace,
  And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun
  As though thou seydest ay 'Sampsoun, Sampsoun';
  And yet, god wot, Sampsoun drank never no wyn.               555
  Thou fallest, as it were a stiked swyn;
  Thy tonge is lost, and al thyn honest cure;
  For dronkenesse is verray sepulture                        (230)
  Of mannes wit and his discrecioun.
  In whom that drinke hath dominacioun,                        560
  He can no conseil kepe, it is no drede.
  Now kepe yow fro the whyte and fro the rede,
  [308: T. 12497-12533.]
  And namely fro the whyte wyn of Lepe,
  That is to selle in Fish-strete or in Chepe.
  This wyn of Spayne crepeth subtilly                          565
  In othere wynes, growing faste by,
  Of which ther ryseth swich fumositee,
  That whan a man hath dronken draughtes three,              (240)
  And weneth that he be at hoom in Chepe,
  He is in Spayne, right at the toune of Lepe,                 570
  Nat at the Rochel, ne at Burdeux toun;
  And thanne wol he seye, 'Sampsoun, Sampsoun.'

    But herkneth, lordings, o word, I yow preye,
  That alle the sovereyn actes, dar I seye,
  Of victories in the olde testament,                          575
  Thurgh verray god, that is omnipotent,
  Were doon in abstinence and in preyere;
  Loketh the Bible, and ther ye may it lere.                 (250)

    573. E. lordes; _rest_ lordinges, lordynges, lordyngs.

    Loke, Attila, the grete conquerour,
  Deyde in his sleep, with shame and dishonour,                580
  Bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse;
  A capitayn shoulde live in sobrenesse.
  And over al this, avyseth yow right wel
  What was comaunded un-to Lamuel--
  Nat Samuel, but Lamuel, seye I---                            585
  Redeth the Bible, and finde it expresly
  Of wyn-yeving to hem that han Iustyse.
  Na-more of this, for it may wel suffyse.                   (260)

    And now that I have spoke of glotonye,
  Now wol I yow defenden hasardrye.                            590
  Hasard is verray moder of lesinges,
  And of deceite, and cursed forsweringes,
  Blaspheme of Crist, manslaughtre, and wast also
  Of catel and of tyme; and forthermo,
  It is repreve and contrarie of honour                        595
  For to ben holde a commune hasardour.
  And ever the hyër he is of estaat,

  The king of Parthes, as the book seith us,

  For he hadde used hasard ther-biforn;

    Now wol I speke of othes false and grete
  A word or two, as olde bokes trete.                          630
  Gret swering is a thing abhominable,
  And false swering is yet more reprevable.
  The heighe god forbad swering at al,
  Witnesse on Mathew; but in special
  Of swering seith the holy Ieremye,                           635
  [310: T. 12570-12605.]
  'Thou shalt seye sooth thyn othes, and nat lye,
  And swere in dome, and eek in rightwisnesse;'
  But ydel swering is a cursednesse.                         (310)
  Bihold and see, that in the firste table
  Of heighe goddes hestes honurable,                           640
  How that the seconde heste of him is this--
  'Tak nat my name in ydel or amis.'
  Lo, rather he forbedeth swich swering
  Than homicyde or many a cursed thing;
  I seye that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth;                  645
  This knowen, that his hestes understondeth,
  How that the second heste of god is that.
  And forther over, I wol thee telle al plat,                (320)
  That vengeance shal nat parten from his hous,
  That of his othes is to outrageous.                          650
  'By goddes precious herte, and by his nayles,
  And by the blode of Crist, that it is in Hayles,
  Seven is my chaunce, and thyn is cink and treye;
  By goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye,
  This dagger shal thurgh-out thyn herte go'--                 655
  This fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two,
  Forswering, ire, falsnesse, homicyde.

  Ther cam a privee theef, men clepeth Deeth,                  675

  And with his spere he smoot his herte a-two,
  And wente his wey with-outen wordes mo.                    (350)
  He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence:
  And, maister, er ye come in his presence,                    680

  For to be war of swich an adversarie:

  Henne over a myle, with-in a greet village,

  Answerde agayn, 'what? carl, with sory grace,
  Why artow al forwrapped save thy face?                     (390)
  Why livestow so longe in so greet age?'

    This olde man gan loke in his visage,                      720
  And seyde thus, 'for I ne can nat finde
  A man, though that I walked in-to Inde,
  Neither in citee nor in no village,
  That wolde chaunge his youthe for myn age;
  And therfore moot I han myn age stille,                      725

  Yow that wol offre, as clene and eek as cleer
  As ye were born; and, lo, sirs, thus I preche.               915
  And Iesu Crist, that is our soules leche,
  So graunte yow his pardon to receyve;
  For that is best; I wol yow nat deceyve.                   (590)

  For he is most envoluped in sinne.

  THE PROLOGE OF THE WYVES TALE OF BATHE.

  'Experience, though noon auctoritee
  Were in this world, were right y-nough to me
  To speke of wo that is in mariage;
  For, lordinges, sith I twelf yeer was of age,
  Thonked be god that is eterne on lyve,                         5
  Housbondes at chirche-dore I have had fyve;
  For I so ofte have y-wedded be;
  And alle were worthy men in hir degree.
  But me was told certeyn, nat longe agon is,
  That sith that Crist ne wente never but onis                  10
  To wedding in the Cane of Galilee,
  That by the same ensample taughte he me
  That I ne sholde wedded be but ones.
  Herke eek, lo! which a sharp word for the nones
  Besyde a welle Iesus, god and man,                            15
  Spak in repreve of the Samaritan:
  "Thou hast y-had fyve housbondes," quod he,
  "And thilke man, the which that hath now thee,
  Is noght thyn housbond;" thus seyde he certeyn;
  What that he mente ther-by, I can nat seyn;                   20
  [321: T. 5603-5636.]
  But that I axe, why that the fifthe man
  Was noon housbond to the Samaritan?
  How manye mighte she have in mariage?
  Yet herde I never tellen in myn age
  Upon this nombre diffinicioun;                                25
  Men may devyne and glosen up and doun.
  But wel I woot expres, with-oute lye,
  God bad us for to wexe and multiplye;
  That gentil text can I wel understonde.
  Eek wel I woot he seyde, myn housbonde                        30
  Sholde lete fader and moder, and take me;
  But of no nombre mencioun made he,
  Of bigamye or of octogamye;
  Why sholde men speke of it vileinye?

  Lo, here the wyse king, dan Salomon;                          35
  I trowe he hadde wyves mo than oon;
  As, wolde god, it leveful were to me
  To be refresshed half so ofte as he!
  Which yifte of god hadde he for alle his wyvis!
  No man hath swich, that in this world alyve is.               40
  God woot, this noble king, as to my wit,
  The firste night had many a mery fit
  With ech of hem, so wel was him on lyve!
  Blessed be god that I have wedded fyve!
  Welcome the sixte, whan that ever he shal.                    45
  For sothe, I wol nat kepe me chast in al;
  Whan myn housbond is fro the world y-gon,
  Som Cristen man shal wedde me anon;
  For thanne thapostle seith, that I am free
  To wedde, a goddes half, wher it lyketh me.                   50
  He seith that to be wedded is no sinne;
  Bet is to be wedded than to brinne.
  What rekketh me, thogh folk seye vileinye
  Of shrewed Lameth and his bigamye?
  [322: T. 5637-5672.]
  I woot wel Abraham was an holy man,                           55
  And Iacob eek, as ferforth as I can;
  And ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
  And many another holy man also.
  Whan saugh ye ever, in any maner age,
  That hye god defended mariage                                 60
  By expres word? I pray you, telleth me;
  Or wher comanded he virginitee?
  I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede,
  Thapostel, whan he speketh of maydenhede;
  He seyde, that precept ther-of hadde he noon.                 65
  Men may conseille a womman to been oon,
  But conseilling is no comandement;
  He putte it in our owene Iugement.
  For hadde god comanded maydenhede,
  Thanne hadde he dampned wedding with the dede;                70
  And certes, if ther were no seed y-sowe,
  Virginitee, wher-of than sholde it growe?
  Poul dorste nat comanden atte leste
  A thing of which his maister yaf noon heste.
  The dart is set up for virginitee;                            75
  Cacche who so may, who renneth best lat see.

    37. _So all but_ E., _which has_ it were leueful vn-to me.   42. E.
    myrie; Hn. murye.   44. E. Hl. Yblessed; _rest_ Blessed (Blissed).
    46. E. chaast.   49. E. _om._ that.   50. Hl. wher so it be; _rest_
    wher it liketh me (_correctly; for_ a goddes half = a god's half).
    51. E. _om._ that.   52. E. Hn. Hl. Bet; _rest_ Better.   54. E. Hl.
    of; _rest_ his.   58. E. _om._ holy.   59. Hl. Whan; E. Whanne; _rest_

    Poul.   75. E. of; Cp. fro; Hl. on; _rest_ for.

    But this word is nat take of every wight,
  But ther as god list give it of his might.
  I woot wel, that thapostel was a mayde;
  But natheless, thogh that he wroot and sayde,                 80
  He wolde that every wight were swich as he,
  Al nis but conseil to virginitee;
  And for to been a wyf, he yaf me leve
  Of indulgence; so it is no repreve
  To wedde me, if that my make dye,                             85
  With-oute excepcioun of bigamye.
  Al were it good no womman for to touche,
  He mente as in his bed or in his couche;
  For peril is bothe fyr and tow tassemble;
  Ye knowe what this ensample may resemble.                     90
  [323: T. 5673-5706.]
  This is al and som, he heeld virginitee
  More parfit than wedding in freletee.
  Freeltee clepe I, but-if that he and she
  Wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee.

    77. E. Hl. taken.   78. E. Cm. lust; Hn. Hl. list.   79. E. _om._
    that.   85. E. Cm. _om._ that.   89. Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. to assemble.   91.
    E. Cm that; Hn. Cp. Pt. Ln. he heeld; Hl. he holdith.   92. E. Cm.
    profiteth; _rest_ parfit.   94. Hn. Hl. leden; _rest_ lede.

    I graunte it wel, I have noon envye,                        95
  Thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye;
  Hem lyketh to be clene, body and goost,
  Of myn estaat I nil nat make no boost.
  For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold,
  He hath nat every vessel al of gold;                         100
  Somme been of tree, and doon hir lord servyse.
  God clepeth folk to him in sondry wyse,
  And everich hath of god a propre yifte,
  Som this, som that,--as him lyketh shifte.

    104. _So all but_ Hl. Ln. _which have_ to schifte. _Perhaps read_ right
    as him.

    Virginitee is greet perfeccioun,                           105
  And continence eek with devocioun.
  But Crist, that of perfeccioun is welle,
  Bad nat every wight he shold go selle
  All that he hadde, and give it to the pore,
  And in swich wyse folwe hime and his fore.                   110
  He spak to hem that wolde live parfitly;
  And lordinges, by your leve, that am nat I.
  I wol bistowe the flour of al myn age
  In the actes and in fruit of mariage.

    108. E. Cm. Hl. _om._ he.   109, 110. E poore, foore; _and_ foore _is

    Telle me also, to what conclusioun                         115
  Were membres maad of generacioun,
  And for what profit was a wight y-wroght?
  Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for noght.
  Glose who-so wole, and seye bothe up and doun,
  That they were maked for purgacioun
  Of urine, and our bothe thinges smale
  Were eek to knowe a femele from a male,
  And for noone other cause: sey ye no?
  The experience woot wel it is noght so;
  [324: T. 5707-5741.]
  So that the clerkes be nat with me wrothe,                   125
  I sey this, that they maked been for bothe,
  This is to seye, for office, and for ese
  Of engendrure, ther we nat god displese.
  Why sholde men elles in hir bokes sette,
  That man shal yelde to his wyf hir dette?                    130
  Now wher-with sholde he make his payement,
  If he ne used his sely instrument?
  Than were they maad up-on a creature,
  To purge uryne, and eek for engendrure.

    116 E. ymaad.   120. Cm. makyd; _rest_ maad; _see_ l. 126.   121. _So_

    But I seye noght that every wight is holde,                135
  That hath swich harneys as I to yow tolde,
  To goon and usen hem in engendrure;
  Than sholde men take of chastitee no cure.
  Crist was a mayde, and shapen as a man,
  And many a seint, sith that the world bigan,                 140
  Yet lived they ever in parfit chastitee.
  I nil envye no virginitee;
  Lat hem be breed of pured whete-seed,
  And lat us wyves hoten barly-breed;
  And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle can,                    145
  Our lord Iesu refresshed many a man.
  In swich estaat as god hath cleped us
  I wol persevere, I nam nat precious.
  In wyfhode I wol use myn instrument
  As frely as my maker hath it sent.                           150
  If I be daungerous, god yeve me sorwe!
  Myn housbond shal it have bothe eve and morwe,
  Whan that him list com forth and paye his dette.
  An housbonde I wol have, I nil nat lette,
  Which shal be bothe my dettour and my thral,                 155
  And have his tribulacioun with-al
  Up-on his flessh, whyl that I am his wyf.
  I have the power duringe al my lyf
  Up-on his propre body, and noght he.
  [325: T. 5742-5776.]
  Right thus the apostel tolde it un-to me;                    160
  And bad our housbondes for to love us weel.
  Al this sentence me lyketh every-deel'--

  As three of hem were gode and two were badde.
  The three men were gode, and riche, and olde;
  Unnethe mighte they the statut holde

  Ye woot wel what I mene of this, pardee!                     200

  A wys womman wol sette hir ever in oon

  For verray shame, and blamed him-self for he
  Had told to me so greet a privetee.

    And so bifel that ones, in a Lente,
  (So often tymes I to my gossib wente,
  For ever yet I lovede to be gay,                             545

  Myn housbond was at London al that Lente;                    550
  I hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye,
  And for to see, and eek for to be seye
  Of lusty folk; what wiste I wher my grace
  Was shapen for to be, or in what place?
  Therefore I made my visitaciouns,                            555
  To vigilies and to processiouns,
  To preching eek and to thise pilgrimages,
  To pleyes of miracles and mariages,
  And wered upon my gaye scarlet gytes.

  Yet was I never with-outen purveyance                        570

    I bar him on honde, he hadde enchanted me;                 575

  And eek I seyde, I mette of him al night;
  He wolde han slayn me as I lay up-right,
  And al my bed was ful of verray blood,
  But yet I hope that he shal do me good;                      580
  For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught.
  And al was fals, I dremed of it right naught,
  [337: T. 6165-6199.]

    But now sir, lat me see, what I shal seyn?                 585
  A! ha! by god, I have my tale ageyn.

    Whan that my fourthe housbond was on bere,
  I weep algate, and made sory chere,
  As wyves moten, for it is usage,
  And with my coverchief covered my visage;                    590
  But for that I was purveyed of a make,
  I weep but smal, and that I undertake.

    592. E. wepte; _but see_ 588.

    To chirche was myn housbond born a-morwe
  With neighebores, that for him maden sorwe;
  And Iankin oure clerk was oon of tho.                        595
  As help me god, whan that I saugh him go
  After the bere, me thoughte he hadde a paire
  Of legges and of feet so clene and faire,
  That al myn herte I yaf un-to his hold.
  He was, I trowe, a twenty winter old,                        600
  And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth;
  But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.
  Gat-tothed I was, and that bicam me weel;
  I hadde the prente of sëynt Venus seel.
  As help me god, I was a lusty oon,                           605
  And faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon;
  And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me,
  I had the beste _quoniam_ mighte be.
  For certes, I am al Venerien
  In felinge, and myn herte is Marcien.                        610
  Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse,
  And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse.
  Myn ascendent was Taur, and Mars ther-inne.
  Allas! allas! that ever love was sinne!
  I folwed ay myn inclinacioun                                 615
  By vertu of my constellacioun;
  That made me I coude noght withdrawe

  Yet have I Martes mark up-on my face,
  And also in another privee place.                            620
  For, god so wis be my savacioun,
  I ne loved never by no discrecioun,
  But ever folwede myn appetyt,
  Al were he short or long, or blak or whyt;
  I took no kepe, so that he lyked me,                         625

  And to him yaf I al the lond and fee                         630
  That ever was me yeven ther-bifore;
  But afterward repented me ful sore.
  He nolde suffre nothing of my list.
  By god, he smoot me ones on the list,
  For that I rente out of his book a leef,                     635
  That of the strook myn ere wex al deef.
  Stiborn I was as is a leonesse,
  And of my tonge a verray Iangleresse,
  And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn,
  From hous to hous, al-though he had it sworn.                640
  For which he often tymes wolde preche,
  And me of olde Romayn gestes teche,
  How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wyf,
  And hir forsook for terme of al his lyf,
  Noght but for open-heeded he hir say                         645
  Lokinge out at his dore upon a day.

    Another Romayn tolde he me by name,
  That, for his wyf was at a someres game
  With-oute his witing, he forsook hir eke.
  And than wolde he up-on his Bible seke                       650
  That ilke proverbe of Ecclesiaste,
  Wher he comandeth and forbedeth faste,
  Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute;
  [339: T. 6226-6271.]
  Than wolde he seye right thus, with-outen doute,
    "Who-so that buildeth his hous al of salwes,               655
    And priketh his blinde hors over the falwes,
    And suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes,
    Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!"
  But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe
  Of his proverbes nof his olde sawe,                          660
  Ne I wolde nat of him corrected be.
  I hate him that my vices telleth me,
  And so do mo, god woot! of us than I.
  This made him with me wood al outrely;
  I nolde noght forbere him in no cas.                         665

    Now wol I seye yow sooth, by seint Thomas,
  Why that I rente out of his book a leef,
  For which he smoot me so that I was deef.

    He hadde a book that gladly, night and day,
  For his desport he wolde rede alway.                         670
  He cleped it Valerie and Theofraste,
  At whiche book he lough alwey ful faste.
  And eek ther was som-tyme a clerk at Rome,
  A cardinal, that highte Seint Ierome,
  That made a book agayn Iovinian;                             675
  In whiche book eek ther was Tertulan,
  Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowys,
  That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys;
  And eek the Parables of Salomon,
  Ovydes Art, and bokes many on,                               680
  And alle thise wer bounden in o volume.
  And every night and day was his custume,
  Whan he had leyser and vacacioun
  From other worldly occupacioun,
  To reden on this book of wikked wyves.                       685
  He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves
  Than been of gode wyves in the Bible.
  For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
  That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,
  [340: T. 6272-6305.]
  But-if it be of holy seintes lyves,                          690
  Ne of noon other womman never the mo.
  Who peyntede the leoun, tel me who?
  By god, if wommen hadde writen stories,
  As clerkes han with-inne hir oratories,
  They wolde han writen of men more wikkednesse                695
  Than all the mark of Adam may redresse.
  The children of Mercurie and of Venus
  Been in hir wirking ful contrarious;
  Mercurie loveth wisdom and science,
  And Venus loveth ryot and dispence.                          700
  And, for hir diverse disposicioun,
  Ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun;
  And thus, god woot! Mercurie is desolat
  In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat;
  And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reysed;                   705
  Therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed.
  The clerk, whan he is old, and may noght do
  Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho,
  Than sit he doun, and writ in his dotage
  That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage!                        710

    But now to purpos, why I tolde thee
  That I was beten for a book, pardee.
  Up-on a night Iankin, that was our syre,
  Redde on his book, as he sat by the fyre,
  Of Eva first, that, for hir wikkednesse,                     715
  Was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse,
  For which that Iesu Crist him-self was slayn,
  That boghte us with his herte-blood agayn.

  Of Hercules and of his Dianyre,                              725
  That caused him to sette himself a-fyre.

  Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lyf;
  Myn housbond hadde a legende of his wyf,
  Eriphilem, that for an ouche of gold
  Hath prively un-to the Grekes told
  Wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place,                745
  For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace.

    Of Lyma tolde he me, and of Lucye,
  They bothe made hir housbondes for to dye;
  That oon for love, that other was for hate;
  Lyma hir housbond, on an even late,                          750

  Lucya, likerous, loved hir housbond so,

  And lete hir lechour dighte hir al the night
  Whyl that the corps lay in the floor up-right.
  And somme han drive nayles in hir brayn

  Whan she cast of hir smok;" and forther-mo,
  "A fair womman, but she be chaast also,
  Is lyk a gold ring in a sowes nose."                         785

  And with his fist he smoot me on the heed,                   795
  That in the floor I lay as I were deed.
  And when he saugh how stille that I lay,
  He was agast, and wolde han fled his way,
  Til atte laste out of my swogh I breyde:
  "O! hastow slayn me, false theef?" I seyde,                  800

  That I have doon, it is thy-self to wyte.

  And yet eft-sones I hitte him on the cheke,

  HERE BIGINNETH THE TALE OF THE WYF OF BATHE.

  In tholde dayes of the king Arthour,
  Of which that Britons speken greet honour,
  All was this land fulfild of fayerye.
  The elf-queen, with hir Ioly companye,                       860
  Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede;
  This was the olde opinion, as I rede,
  I speke of manye hundred yeres ago;
  But now can no man see none elves mo.
  For now the grete charitee and prayeres                      865
  Of limitours and othere holy freres,                        (10)
  That serchen every lond and every streem,
  As thikke as motes in the sonne-beem,
  Blessinge halles, chambres, kichenes, boures,
  Citees, burghes, castels, hye toures,                        870
  Thropes, bernes, shipnes, dayeryes,
  This maketh that ther been no fayeryes.
  For ther as wont to walken was an elf,
  Ther walketh now the limitour him-self
  In undermeles and in morweninges,                            875
  And seyth his matins and his holy thinges                   (20)
  As he goth in his limitacioun.
  Wommen may go saufly up and doun,
  In every bush, or under every tree;
  Ther is noon other incubus but he,                           880
  And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour.

  That on a day cam rydinge fro river;
  And happed that, allone as she was born,                     885
  He saugh a mayde walkinge him biforn,                       (30)
  Of whiche mayde anon, maugree hir heed,
  By verray force he rafte hir maydenheed;
  For which oppressioun was swich clamour
  And swich pursute un-to the king Arthour,                    890
  That dampned was this knight for to be deed
  By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed
  Paraventure, swich was the statut tho;
  But that the quene and othere ladies mo
  So longe preyeden the king of grace,                         895
  Til he his lyf him graunted in the place,                   (40)

  With-inne his brest ful sorweful was the goost;            (130)
  But hoom he gooth, he mighte nat soiourne.
  The day was come, that hoomward moste he tourne,
  And in his wey it happed him to ryde,
  In al this care, under a forest-syde,                        990
  [349: T. 6573-6609.]
  Wher-as he saugh up-on a daunce go

  For, god it woot, men may wel often finde                   1150
  A lordes sone do shame and vileinye;
  And he that wol han prys of his gentrye
  For he was boren of a gentil hous,
  And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous,
  And nil him-selven do no gentil dedis,                      1155
  Ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed is,                (300)
  He nis nat gentil, be he duk or erl;
  For vileyns sinful dedes make a cherl.
  For gentillesse nis but renomee
  Of thyne auncestres, for hir heigh bountee,                 1160
  Which is a strange thing to thy persone.
  Thy gentillesse cometh fro god allone;

  It was no-thing biquethe us with our place.

  Povert is this, al-though it seme elenge:

  Maketh his god and eek him-self to knowe.

  That boldely dide execucioun
  In punisshinge of fornicacioun,
  Of wicchecraft, and eek of bauderye,
  Of diffamacioun, and avoutrye,
  Of chirche-reves, and of testaments,                        1305

  Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve                     (30)
  Twenty thousand freres in a route,                          1695
  And thurgh-out helle swarmeden aboute;
  And comen agayn, as faste as they may gon,
  And in his ers they crepten everichon.
  He clapte his tayl agayn, and lay ful stille.
  This frere, whan he loked hadde his fille                   1700
  Upon the torments of this sory place,
  His spirit god restored of his grace
  Un-to his body agayn, and he awook;
  But natheles, for fere yet he quook,                        (40)
  So was the develes ers ay in his minde,                     1705
  That is his heritage of verray kinde.

  Lordinges, ther is in Yorkshire, as I gesse,
  A mersshy contree called Holdernesse,                       1710
  In which ther wente a limitour aboute,
  To preche, and eek to begge, it is no doute.
  And so bifel, that on a day this frere
  Had preched at a chirche in his manere,
  And specially, aboven every thing,                          1715
  Excited he the peple in his preching,
  To trentals, and to yeve, for goddes sake,
  Wher-with men mighten holy houses make,                     (10)
  Ther as divyne service is honoured,
  Nat ther as it is wasted and devoured,                      1720
  Ne ther it nedeth nat for to be yive,
  As to possessioners, that mowen live,
  Thanked be god, in wele and habundaunce.
  'Trentals,' seyde he, 'deliveren fro penaunce
  Hir freendes soules, as wel olde as yonge,                  1725
  Ye, whan that they been hastily y-songe;
  Nat for to holde a preest Ioly and gay,
  He singeth nat but o masse in a day;                        (20)
  Delivereth out,' quod he, 'anon the soules;
  Ful hard it is with fleshhook or with oules                 1730
  To been y-clawed, or to brenne or bake;
  Now spede yow hastily, for Cristes sake.'

       *       *       *       *       *

  HERE BIGINNETH THE TALE OF THE CLERK OF OXENFORD.

  Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille,
  Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde,
  A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
  Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,                 60
  That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
  And many another delitable sighte,
  And Saluces this noble contree highte.

  A markis whylom lord was of that londe,
  As were his worthy eldres him bifore;                         65
  And obeisant and redy to his honde                          (10)
  Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and more.
  Thus in delyt he liveth, and hath don yore,
  Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of fortune,
  Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.                       70

  Therwith he was, to speke as of linage,
  The gentilleste y-born of Lumbardye,
  A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,
  And ful of honour and of curteisye;
  Discreet y-nogh his contree for to gye,                       75
  Save in somme thinges that he was to blame,                 (20)
  And Walter was this yonge lordes name.

    76. E. Saue that; _rest omit_ that.

  I blame him thus, that he considereth noght
  In tyme cominge what mighte him bityde,
  But on his lust present was al his thoght,                    80
  As for to hauke and hunte on every syde;
  [392: T. 7958-7988.]
  Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde,
  And eek he nolde, and that was worst of alle,
  Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.

    79. _So_ Hn. Ln.; E. hym myghte; Pt. my[gh]t; Hl. mighte.   84. Pt. Ln.
    ou[gh]t; E. Hn. noght; Hl. no thing.

  Only that point his peple bar so sore,                        85
  That flokmele on a day they to him wente,                   (30)
  And oon of hem, that wysest was of lore,
  Or elles that the lord best wolde assente
  That he sholde telle him what his peple mente,
  Or elles coude he shewe wel swich matere,                     90
  He to the markis seyde as ye shul here.

  'O noble markis, your humanitee
  Assureth us and yeveth us hardinesse,
  As ofte as tyme is of necessitee
  That we to yow mowe telle our hevinesse;                      95
  Accepteth, lord, now for your gentillesse,                  (40)
  That we with pitous herte un-to yow pleyne,
  And lete your eres nat my voys disdeyne.

    93. Hn. Pt. and yeueth; Hl. and yiueth; E. to yeue; Ln. and whisse.

  Al have I noght to done in this matere
  More than another man hath in this place,                    100
  Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so dere,
  Han alwey shewed me favour and grace,
  I dar the better aske of yow a space
  Of audience, to shewen our requeste,
  And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.                 105

    103. E. Hn. bettre; _rest_ better.

  For certes, lord, so wel us lyketh yow                      (50)
  And al your werk and ever han doon, that we
  Ne coude nat us self devysen how
  We mighte liven in more felicitee,
  Save o thing, lord, if it your wille be,                     110
  That for to been a wedded man yow leste,
  Than were your peple in sovereyn hertes reste.

    108. Pt. Ln. oure; E. Hn. Cp. vs.   110. E. Ln. _omit_ it.

[393: T. 7989-8023.]

  Boweth your nekke under that blisful yok
  Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse,
  Which that men clepeth spousaille or wedlok;                 115
  And thenketh, lord, among your thoghtes wyse,               (60)
  How that our dayes passe in sondry wyse;
  For though we slepe or wake, or rome, or ryde,
  Ay fleeth the tyme, it nil no man abyde.

  And though your grene youthe floure as yit,                  120
  In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,
  And deeth manaceth every age, and smit
  In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon:
  And al so certein as we knowe echoon
  That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle                      125
  Been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle.               (70)

  Accepteth than of us the trewe entente,
  That never yet refuseden your heste,
  And we wol, lord, if that ye wol assente,
  Chese yow a wyf in short tyme, atte leste,                   130
  Born of the gentilleste and of the meste
  Of al this lond, so that it oghte seme
  Honour to god and yow, as we can deme.

    leeste, meeste; Cm. heste, leste, meste.

  Deliver us out of al this bisy drede,
  And tak a wyf, for hye goddes sake;                          135
  For if it so bifelle, as god forbede,                       (80)
  That thurgh your deeth your linage sholde slake,
  And that a straunge successour sholde take
  Your heritage, o! wo were us alyve!
  Wherfor we pray you hastily to wyve.'                        140

    137. Cp. Pt. lynage; Ln. Hl. lignage; E. lyne; Hn. ligne; Cm. lyf.

  Hir meke preyere and hir pitous chere
  Made the markis herte han pitee.
  'Ye wol,' quod he, 'myn owene peple dere,
  To that I never erst thoghte streyne me.
  I me reioysed of my libertee,                                145
  That selde tyme is founde in mariage;                       (90)
  Ther I was free, I moot been in servage.

    144. E. thoughte; Hn. thoghte.

[394: T. 8024-8058.]

  But nathelees I see your trewe entente,
  And truste upon your wit, and have don ay;
  Wherfor of my free wil I wol assente                         150
  To wedde me, as sone as ever I may.
  But ther-as ye han profred me to-day
  To chese me a wyf, I yow relesse
  That choys, and prey yow of that profre cesse.

  For god it woot, that children ofte been                     155

  Bountee comth al of god, nat of the streen
  Of which they been engendred and y-bore;
  I truste in goddes bountee, and therfore
  My mariage and myn estaat and reste                          160

  Lat me alone in chesinge of my wyf,
  That charge up-on my bak I wol endure;
  But I yow preye, and charge up-on your lyf,
  That what wyf that I take, ye me assure                      165
  To worshipe hir, whyl that hir lyf may dure,               (110)
  In word and werk, bothe here and everywhere,
  As she an emperoures doghter were.

    165. So Hn. Cp. Ln.; E. Cm. _omit_ That; Pt. _om._ what.

  And forthermore, this shal ye swere, that ye
  Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve;               170
  For sith I shal forgoon my libertee
  At your requeste, as ever moot I thryve,
  Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve;
  And but ye wole assente in swich manere,
  I prey yow, speketh na-more of this matere.'                 175

  With hertly wil they sworen, and assenten                  (120)
  To al this thing, ther seyde no wight nay;
  Bisekinge him of grace, er that they wenten,
  That he wolde graunten hem a certein day
  Of his spousaille, as sone as ever he may;                   180
  For yet alwey the peple som-what dredde
  Lest that this markis no wyf wolde wedde.

  [395: T. 8059-8089.]
  He graunted hem a day, swich as him leste,
  On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,
  And seyde, he dide al this at hir requeste;                  185
  And they, with humble entente, buxomly,                    (130)
  Knelinge up-on her knees ful reverently
  Him thanken alle, and thus they han an ende
  Of hir entente, and hoom agayn they wende.

  And heer-up-on he to his officeres                           190

  EXPLICIT PRIMA PARS.  INCIPIT SECUNDA PARS.

  Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable
  Ther-as this markis shoop his mariage,
  Ther stood a throp, of site delitable,
  In which that povre folk of that village                     200
  Hadden hir bestes and hir herbergage,
  And of hir labour took hir sustenance
  After that the erthe yaf hem habundance.

  Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man
  Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;                   205
  But hye god som tyme senden can                            (150)

  Ianicula men of that throp him calle.
  A doghter hadde he, fair y-nogh to sighte,

  But for to speke of vertuous beautee,
  Than was she oon the faireste under sonne;
  For povreliche y-fostred up was she,
  [396: T. 8090-8121.]
  No likerous lust was thurgh hir herte y-ronne;
  Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne                     215
  She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese,                  (160)
  She knew wel labour, but non ydel ese.

    211. E. bountee; _rest_ beautee, beute.

  But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,
  Yet in the brest of hir virginitee
  Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage;                       220
  And in greet reverence and charitee
  Hir olde povre fader fostred she;
  A fewe sheep spinning on feeld she kepte,
  She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte.

  And whan she hoomward cam, she wolde bringe                  225
  Wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte,                        (170)
  The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir livinge,
  And made hir bed ful harde and no-thing softe;
  And ay she kepte hir fadres lyf on-lofte
  With everich obeisaunce and diligence                        230
  That child may doon to fadres reverence.

  Up-on Grisilde, this povre creature,
  Ful ofte sythe this markis sette his yë
  As he on hunting rood paraventure;
  And whan it fil that he mighte hir espye,                    235

  And eek hir vertu, passing any wight                         240
  Of so yong age, as wel in chere as dede.
  For thogh the peple have no greet insight
  In vertu, he considered ful right
  Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde
  Wedde hir only, if ever he wedde sholde.                     245

    241. E. chiere.   242. E. hadde; Hn. Cm. hath; Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. haue.

  The day of wedding cam, but no wight can                   (190)
  Telle what womman that it sholde be;
  For which merveille wondred many a man,
  And seyden, whan they were in privetee,
  'Wol nat our lord yet leve his vanitee?                      250
  Wol he nat wedde? allas, allas the whyle!
  Why wol he thus him-self and us bigyle?'

  Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,

  This royal markis, richely arrayed,
  Lordes and ladyes in his companye,
  The whiche unto the feste were y-prayed,
  And of his retenue the bachelrye,                            270
  With many a soun of sondry melodye,

  To fecchen water at a welle is went,                       (220)
  And cometh hoom as sone as ever she may.
  For wel she hadde herd seyd, that thilke day
  The markis sholde wedde, and, if she mighte,
  She wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte.                  280

  [398: T. 8157-8191.]
  She thoghte, 'I wol with othere maydens stonde,
  That been my felawes, in our dore, and see
  The markisesse, and therfor wol I fonde
  To doon at hoom, as sone as it may be,
  The labour which that longeth un-to me;                      285
  And than I may at leyser hir biholde,                      (230)

  And as she wolde over hir threshfold goon,
  The markis cam and gan hir for to calle;
  And she sette doun hir water-pot anoon                       290
  Bisyde the threshfold, in an oxes stalle,
  And doun up-on hir knees she gan to falle,
  And with sad contenance kneleth stille
  Til she had herd what was the lordes wille.

  This thoghtful markis spak un-to this mayde                  295
  Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere,                     (240)
  'Wher is your fader, Grisildis?' he sayde,
  And she with reverence, in humble chere,
  Answerde, 'lord, he is al redy here.'
  And in she gooth with-outen lenger lette,                    300
  And to the markis she hir fader fette.

  He by the hond than took this olde man,
  And seyde thus, whan he him hadde asyde,
  'Ianicula, I neither may ne can
  Lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde.                       305
  If that thou vouche-sauf, what-so bityde,                  (250)

  If that thou wolt un-to that purpos drawe,
  To take me as for thy sone-in-lawe?'                         315

  [399: T. 8192-8226.]
  This sodeyn cas this man astoned so,                       (260)
  That reed he wex, abayst, and al quaking
  He stood unnethes seyde he wordes mo,
  But only thus: 'lord,' quod he, 'my willing
  Is as ye wole, ne ayeines your lyking                        320
  I wol no-thing; ye be my lord so dere;

  'That in thy chambre I and thou and she
  Have a collacion, and wostow why?                            325
  For I wol axe if it hir wille be                           (270)
  To be my wyf, and reule hir after me;
  And al this shal be doon in thy presence,
  I wol noght speke out of thyn audience.'

  And in the chambre whyl they were aboute                     330
  Hir tretis, which as ye shal after here,
  The peple cam un-to the hous with-oute,
  And wondred hem in how honest manere
  And tentifly she kepte hir fader dere.
  But outerly Grisildis wondre mighte,                         335
  For never erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.                (280)

  No wonder is thogh that she were astoned
  To seen so greet a gest come in that place;
  She never was to swiche gestes woned,
  For which she loked with ful pale face.                      340
  But shortly forth this tale for to chace,
  Thise arn the wordes that the markis sayde
  To this benigne verray feithful mayde.

    337. E. Pt. _omit_ that.

  'Grisilde,' he seyde, 'ye shul wel understonde
  It lyketh to your fader and to me                            345
  That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde,                (290)
  As I suppose, ye wol that it so be.
  But thise demandes axe I first,' quod he,
  'That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse,
  Wol ye assente, or elles yow avyse?                          350

  [400: T. 8227-8261.]
  I seye this, be ye redy with good herte
  To al my lust, and that I frely may,
  As me best thinketh, do yow laughe or smerte,
  And never ye to grucche it, night ne day?
  And eek whan I sey "ye," ne sey nat "nay,"                   355
  Neither by word ne frowning contenance;                    (300)
  Swer this, and here I swere our alliance.'

    357. E. yow; _rest_ oure.

  Wondring upon this word, quaking for drede,
  She seyde, 'lord, undigne and unworthy
  Am I to thilke honour that ye me bede;                       360
  But as ye wol your-self, right so wol I.
  And heer I swere that never willingly
  In werk ne thoght I nil yow disobeye,
  For to be deed, though me were looth to deye.'

  'This is y-nogh, Grisilde myn!' quod he.                     365
  And forth he gooth with a ful sobre chere                  (310)
  Out at the dore, and after that cam she,
  And to the peple he seyde in this manere,
  'This is my wyf,' quod he, 'that standeth here.
  Honoureth hir, and loveth hir, I preye,                      370
  Who-so me loveth; ther is na-more to seye.'

  And for that no-thing of hir olde gere
  She sholde bringe in-to his hous, he bad
  That wommen sholde dispoilen hir right there;
  Of which thise ladyes were nat right glad                    375
  To handle hir clothes wher-in she was clad.                (320)
  But natheles this mayde bright of hewe
  Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe.

  Hir heres han they kembd, that lay untressed
  Ful rudely, and with hir fingres smale                       380
  A corone on hir heed they han y-dressed,
  And sette hir ful of nowches grete and smale;
  Of hir array what sholde I make a tale?
  Unnethe the peple hir knew for hir fairnesse,
  Whan she translated was in swich richesse.                   385

  Broght for the same cause, and than hir sette
  Up-on an hors, snow-whyt and wel ambling,
  And to his paleys, er he lenger lette,
  With Ioyful peple that hir ladde and mette,                  390
  Conveyed hir, and thus the day they spende
  In revel, til the sonne gan descende.

  And shortly forth this tale for to chace,
  I seye that to this newe markisesse
  God hath swich favour sent hir of his grace,                 395
  That it ne semed nat by lyklinesse                         (340)
  That she was born and fed in rudenesse,
  As in a cote or in an oxe-stalle,
  But norished in an emperoures halle.

  To every wight she woxen is so dere                          400
  And worshipful, that folk ther she was bore
  And from hir birthe knewe hir yeer by yere,
  Unnethe trowed they, but dorste han swore
  That to Ianicle, of which I spak bifore,
  She doghter nas, for, as by coniecture,                      405

  So benigne and so digne of reverence,

  So spradde of hir heigh bountee the fame,

  Was ever in suspect of hir mariage;                          905
  For ever he demed, sith that it bigan,                     (850)
  That whan the lord fulfild had his corage,
  Him wolde thinke it were a disparage
  To his estaat so lowe for talighte,
  And voyden hir as sone as ever he mighte.                    910

  Agayns his doghter hastilich goth he,
  For he by noyse of folk knew hir cominge,
  And with hir olde cote, as it mighte be,
  He covered hir, ful sorwefully wepinge;
  But on hir body mighte he it nat bringe.                     915
  For rude was the cloth, and more of age                    (860)
  By dayes fele than at hir mariage.

  That neither by hir wordes ne hir face                       920

  Ne shewed she that hir was doon offence;
  [417: T. 8799-8828.]
  Ne of hir heigh estaat no remembraunce
  Ne hadde she, as by hir countenaunce.

  No wonder is, for in hir grete estaat                        925
  Hir goost was ever in pleyn humylitee;                     (870)
  No tendre mouth, non herte delicaat,
  No pompe, no semblant of royaltee,
  But ful of pacient benignitee,
  Discreet and prydeles, ay honurable,                         930
  And to hir housbonde ever meke and stable.

  Men speke of Iob and most for his humblesse,
  As clerkes, whan hem list, can wel endyte,
  Namely of men, but as in soothfastnesse,
  Thogh clerkes preyse wommen but a lyte,                      935
  Ther can no man in humblesse him acquyte                   (880)

  And reverently and wysly she him grette.

  Right noght was she abayst of hir clothing,
  Though it were rude and somdel eek to-rent.

  Grisilde is deed, and eek hir pacience,
  And bothe atones buried in Itaille;
  For which I crye in open audience,

  No wedded man so hardy be tassaille                         1180
  His wyves pacience, in hope to finde
  Grisildes, for in certein he shall faille!

  O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,
  Lat noon humilitee your tonge naille,
  Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence                     1185
  To wryte of yow a storie of swich mervaille               (1130)

  But evere answereth at the countretaille;                   1190
  Beth nat bidaffed for your innocence,
  But sharply tak on yow the governaille.
  Emprinteth wel this lesson in your minde
  For commune profit, sith it may availle.

  Ye archewyves, stondeth at defence,                         1195
  Sin ye be stronge as is a greet camaille;                 (1140)

  Ne dreed hem nat, do hem no reverence;
  For though thyn housbonde armed be in maille,

  In Ialousye I rede eek thou him binde,                      1205

  'Weping and wayling, care, and other sorwe
  I know y-nogh, on even and a-morwe,'
  Quod the Marchaunt, 'and so don othere mo                   1215
  That wedded been, I trowe that it be so.
  For, wel I woot, it fareth so with me.
  I have a wyf, the worste that may be;
  For thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were,
  She wolde him overmacche, I dar wel swere.                  1220
  What sholde I yow reherce in special
  Hir hye malice? she is a shrewe at al.                      (10)
  Ther is a long and large difference
  Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience
  And of my wyf the passing crueltee.                         1225
  Were I unbounden, al-so moot I thee!
  I wolde never eft comen in the snare.
  We wedded men live in sorwe and care;
  Assaye who-so wol, and he shal finde
  I seye sooth, by seint Thomas of Inde,                      1230
  As for the more part, I sey nat alle.
  God shilde that it sholde so bifalle!                       (20)

    A! good sir hoost! I have y-wedded be
  Thise monthes two, and more nat, pardee;
  And yet, I trowe, he that all his lyve                      1235
  Wyflees hath been, though that men wolde him ryve
  Un-to the herte, ne coude in no manere
  Tellen so muchel sorwe, as I now here
  Coude tellen of my wyves cursednesse!'

    'Now,' quod our hoost, 'Marchaunt, so god yow blesse,     1240
  Sin ye so muchel knowen of that art,
  Ful hertely I pray yow telle us part.'                      (30)

    'Gladly,' quod he, 'but of myn owene sore,
  For sory herte, I telle may na-more.'

  HERE BIGINNETH THE MARCHANTES TALE.

  Whylom ther was dwellinge in Lumbardye                      1245
  A worthy knight, that born was of Pavye,
  In which he lived in greet prosperitee;
  And sixty yeer a wyflees man was he,
  And folwed ay his bodily delyt
  On wommen, ther-as was his appetyt,                         1250
  As doon thise foles that ben seculeer.
  And whan that he was passed sixty yeer,
  Were it for holinesse or for dotage,
  I can nat seye, but swich a greet corage                    (10)
  Hadde this knight to been a wedded man,                     1255
  That day and night he dooth al that he can
  Tespyen where he mighte wedded be;
  Preyinge our lord to granten him, that he
  Mighte ones knowe of thilke blisful lyf
  That is bitwixe an housbond and his wyf;                    1260
  And for to live under that holy bond
  With which that first god man and womman bond,
  'Non other lyf,' seyde he, 'is worth a bene;
  For wedlok is so esy and so clene,                          (20)
  That in this world it is a paradys.'                        1265
  Thus seyde this olde knight, that was so wys.

    HEADING. _So_ E. Hn. Pt.   1246. Pt. at; Ln. in (_for_ of).

    And certeinly, as sooth as god is king,
  To take a wyf, it is a glorious thing,
  And namely whan a man is old and hoor;
  Thanne is a wyf the fruit of his tresor.                    1270
  Than sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir,
  [428: T. 9148-9180.]
  On which he mighte engendren him an heir,
  And lede his lyf in Ioye and in solas,
  Wher-as thise bacheleres singe 'allas,'                     (30)
  Whan that they finden any adversitee                        1275
  In love, which nis but childish vanitee.
  And trewely it sit wel to be so,
  That bacheleres have often peyne and wo;
  On brotel ground they builde, and brotelnesse
  They finde, whan they wene sikernesse.                      1280
  They live but as a brid or as a beste,
  In libertee, and under non areste,
  Ther-as a wedded man in his estaat
  Liveth a lyf blisful and ordinaat,                          (40)
  Under the yok of mariage y-bounde;                          1285
  Wel may his herte in Ioye and blisse habounde.
  For who can be so buxom as a wyf?
  Who is so trewe, and eek so ententyf
  To kepe him, syk and hool, as is his make?
  For wele or wo, she wol him nat forsake.                    1290
  She nis nat wery him to love and serve,
  Thogh that he lye bedrede til he sterve.
  And yet somme clerkes seyn, it nis nat so,
  Of whiche he, Theofraste, is oon of tho.                    (50)
  What force though Theofraste liste lye?                     1295
  'Ne take no wyf,' quod he, 'for housbondrye,
  As for to spare in houshold thy dispence;
  A trewe servant dooth more diligence,
  Thy good to kepe, than thyn owene wyf.
  For she wol clayme half part al hir lyf;                    1300
  And if that thou be syk, so god me save,
  Thy verray frendes or a trewe knave
  Wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay
  After thy good, and hath don many a day.                    (60)
  And if thou take a wyf un-to thyn hold,                [T. _om._
  Ful lightly maystow been a cokewold.'                  [T. _om._
  [429: T. 9181-9216.]
  This sentence, and an hundred thinges worse,
  Wryteth this man, ther god his bones corse!
  But take no kepe of al swich vanitee;
  Deffye Theofraste and herke me.                             1310

  Or moebles, alle ben yiftes of fortune,                     (70)
  That passen as a shadwe upon a wal.                         1315

    Mariage is a ful gret sacrement;
  He which that hath no wyf, I holde him shent;               1320
  He liveth helplees and al desolat,
  I speke of folk in seculer estaat.
  And herke why, I sey nat this for noght,
  That womman is for mannes help y-wroght.                    (80)
  The hye god, whan he hadde Adam maked,                      1325
  And saugh him al allone, bely-naked,

  'Lat us now make an help un-to this man
  Lyk to him-self;' and thanne he made him Eve.
  Heer may ye se, and heer-by may ye preve,                   1330
  That wyf is mannes help and his confort,
  His paradys terrestre and his disport.
  So buxom and so vertuous is she,
  They moste nedes live in unitee.                            (90)
  O flesh they been, and o flesh, as I gesse,                 1335
  Hath but on herte, in wele and in distresse.

    1323. Cp. herkne; Pt. Ln. Hl. herken.

    A wyf! a! Seinte Marie, _benedicite!_
  How mighte a man han any adversitee
  That hath a wyf? certes, I can nat seye.
  The blisse which that is bitwixe hem tweye                  1340
  Ther may no tonge telle, or herte thinke.
  If he be povre, she helpeth him to swinke;
  [430: T. 9217-9252.]
  She kepeth his good, and wasteth never a deel;
  Al that hir housbonde lust, hir lyketh weel;               (100)
  She seith not ones 'nay,' whan he seith 'ye.'               1345
  'Do this,' seith he; 'al redy, sir,' seith she.
  O blisful ordre of wedlok precious,
  Thou art so mery, and eek so vertuous,
  And so commended and appreved eek,
  That every man that halt him worth a leek,                  1350
  Up-on his bare knees oghte al his lyf
  Thanken his god that him hath sent a wyf;
  Or elles preye to god him for to sende
  A wyf, to laste un-to his lyves ende.                      (110)
  For thanne his lyf is set in sikernesse;                    1355
  He may nat be deceyved, as I gesse,
  So that he werke after his wyves reed;
  Than may he boldly beren up his heed,
  They been so trewe and ther-with-al so wyse;
  For which, if thou wolt werken as the wyse,                 1360
  Do alwey so as wommen wol thee rede.

    Lo, how that Iacob, as thise clerkes rede,
  By good conseil of his moder Rebekke,
  Bond the kides skin aboute his nekke;                      (120)
  Thurgh which his fadres benisoun he wan.                    1365

    Lo, Iudith, as the storie eek telle can,
  By wys conseil she goddes peple kepte,
  And slow him, Olofernus, whyl he slepte.

    Lo Abigayl, by good conseil how she
  Saved hir housbond Nabal, whan that he                      1370
  Sholde han be slayn; and loke, Ester also
  By good conseil delivered out of wo
  The peple of god, and made him, Mardochee,
  Of Assuere enhaunced for to be.                            (130)

    Ther nis no-thing in gree superlatyf,                     1375
  As seith Senek, above an humble wyf.

    Suffre thy wyves tonge, as Caton bit;
  She shal comande, and thou shalt suffren it;
  [431: T. 9253-9289.]
  And yet she wol obeye of curteisye.
  A wyf is keper of thyn housbondrye;                         1380
  Wel may the syke man biwaille and wepe,
  Ther-as ther nis no wyf the hous to kepe.
  I warne thee, if wysly thou wolt wirche,
  Love wel thy wyf, as Crist loveth his chirche.             (140)
  If thou lovest thy-self, thou lovest thy wyf;               1385
  No man hateth his flesh, but in his lyf
  He fostreth it, and therfore bidde I thee,
  Cherisse thy wyf, or thou shalt never thee.
  Housbond and wyf, what so men Iape or pleye,
  Of worldly folk holden the siker weye;                      1390
  They been so knit, ther may noon harm bityde;
  And namely, up-on the wyves syde.
  For which this Ianuarie, of whom I tolde,
  Considered hath, in with his dayes olde,                   (150)
  The lusty lyf, the vertuous quiete,                         1395
  That is in mariage hony-swete;
  And for his freendes on a day he sente,
  To tellen hem theffect of his entente.

    1384. E. Hn. loued; Cm. louede; Cp. Pt. Ln. loueth; Hl. doth.

    With face sad, his tale he hath hem told;
  He seyde, 'freendes, I am hoor and old,                     1400
  And almost, god wot, on my pittes brinke;
  Up-on my soule somwhat moste I thinke.
  I have my body folily despended;
  Blessed be god, that it shal been amended!                 (160)
  For I wol be, certeyn, a wedded man,                        1405
  And that anoon in al the haste I can,
  Un-to som mayde fair and tendre of age.
  I prey yow, shapeth for my mariage
  Al sodeynly, for I wol nat abyde;
  And I wol fonde tespyen, on my syde,                        1410
  To whom I may be wedded hastily.
  But for-as-muche as ye ben mo than I,
  Ye shullen rather swich a thing espyen
  Than I, and wher me best were to allyen.                   (170)

    1402. E. Cm. the; _rest_ my.   1410. Cp. Ln. aspye.

    But o thing warne I yow, my freendes dere,                1415
  [432: T. 9290-9324.]
  I wol non old wyf han in no manere.
  She shal nat passe twenty yeer, certayn;
  Old fish and yong flesh wolde I have ful fayn.
  Bet is,' quod he, 'a pyk than a pikerel;
  And bet than old boef is the tendre veel.                   1420
  I wol no womman thritty yeer of age,
  It is but bene-straw and greet forage.
  And eek thise olde widwes, god it woot,
  They conne so muchel craft on Wades boot,                  (180)
  So muchel broken harm, whan that hem leste,                 1425
  That with hem sholde I never live in reste.
  For sondry scoles maken sotil clerkis;
  Womman of manye scoles half a clerk is.
  But certeynly, a yong thing may men gye,
  Right as men may warm wex with handes plye.                 1430
  Wherfore I sey yow pleynly, in a clause,
  I wol non old wyf han right for this cause.
  For if so were, I hadde swich mischaunce,
  That I in hir ne coude han no plesaunce,                   (190)
  Thanne sholde I lede my lyf in avoutrye,                    1435
  And go streight to the devel, whan I dye.
  Ne children sholde I none up-on hir geten;
  Yet were me lever houndes had me eten,
  Than that myn heritage sholde falle
  In straunge hand, and this I tell yow alle.                 1440
  I dote nat, I woot the cause why
  Men sholde wedde, and forthermore wot I,
  Ther speketh many a man of mariage,
  That woot na-more of it than woot my page,                 (200)
  For whiche causes man sholde take a wyf.                    1445
  If he ne may nat liven chast his lyf,
  Take him a wyf with greet devocioun,
  By-cause of leveful procreacioun
  Of children, to thonour of god above,
  And nat only for paramour or love;                          1450
  [433: T. 9325-9360.]
  And for they sholde lecherye eschue,
  And yelde hir dettes whan that they ben due;
  Or for that ech of hem sholde helpen other
  In meschief, as a suster shal the brother;                 (210)
  And live in chastitee ful holily.                           1455
  But sires, by your leve, that am nat I.
  For god be thanked, I dar make avaunt,
  I fele my limes stark and suffisaunt
  To do al that a man bilongeth to;
  I woot my-selven best what I may do.                        1460
  Though I be hoor, I fare as dooth a tree
  That blosmeth er that fruyt y-woxen be;
  A blosmy tree nis neither drye ne deed.
  I fele me nowher hoor but on myn heed;                     (220)
  Myn herte and alle my limes been as grene                   1465
  As laurer thurgh the yeer is for to sene.
  And sin that ye han herd al myn entente,

    Diverse men diversely him tolde
  Of mariage manye ensamples olde.                            1470
  Somme blamed it, somme preysed it, certeyn;
  But atte laste, shortly for to seyn,
  As al day falleth altercacioun
  Bitwixen freendes in disputisoun,                          (230)
  Ther fil a stryf bitwixe his bretheren two,                 1475
  Of whiche that oon was cleped Placebo,
  Iustinus soothly called was that other.

    Placebo seyde, 'o Ianuarie, brother,
  Ful litel nede had ye, my lord so dere,
  Conseil to axe of any that is here;                         1480
  But that ye been so ful of sapience,
  That yow ne lyketh, for your heighe prudence,
  To weyven fro the word of Salomon.
  This word seyde he un-to us everichon:                     (240)
  "Wirk alle thing by conseil," thus seyde he,                1485
  "And thanne shaltow nat repente thee."
  [434: T. 9361-9394.]
  But though that Salomon spak swich a word,
  Myn owene dere brother and my lord,
  So wisly god my soule bringe at reste,
  I hold your owene conseil is the beste.                     1490
  For brother myn, of me tak this motyf,
  I have now been a court-man al my lyf.
  And god it woot, though I unworthy be,
  I have stonden in ful greet degree                         (250)
  Abouten lordes of ful heigh estaat;                         1495
  Yet hadde I never with noon of hem debaat.
  I never hem contraried, trewely;
  I woot wel that my lord can more than I.
  What that he seith, I holde it ferme and stable;
  I seye the same, or elles thing semblable.                  1500
  A ful gret fool is any conseillour,
  That serveth any lord of heigh honour,
  That dar presume, or elles thenken it,
  That his conseil sholde passe his lordes wit.              (260)
  Nay, lordes been no foles, by my fay;                       1505
  Ye han your-selven shewed heer to-day
  So heigh sentence, so holily and weel,
  That I consente and conferme every-deel
  Your wordes alle, and your opinioun.
  By god, ther nis no man in al this toun                     1510
  Nin al Itaille, that coude bet han sayd;
  Crist halt him of this conseil wel apayd.
  And trewely, it is an heigh corage
  Of any man, that stopen is in age,                         (270)
  To take a yong wyf; by my fader kin,                        1515
  Your herte hangeth on a Ioly pin.

  'Now brother myn, be pacient, I preye,
  Sin ye han seyd, and herkneth what I seye.
  Senek among his othere wordes wyse
  Seith, that a man oghte him right wel avyse,               (280)
  To whom he yeveth his lond or his catel.                    1525
  And sin I oghte avyse me right wel
  To whom I yeve my good awey fro me,
  Wel muchel more I oghte avysed be
  To whom I yeve my body; for alwey
  I warne yow wel, it is no childes pley                      1530
  To take a wyf with-oute avysement.
  Men moste enquere, this is myn assent,
  Wher she be wys, or sobre, or dronkelewe,
  Or proud, or elles other-weys a shrewe;                    (290)
  A chydester, or wastour of thy good,                        1535
  Or riche, or poore, or elles mannish wood.
  Al-be-it so that no man finden shal

  Swiche as the cursed monk dan Constantyn                    1810
  Hath writen in his book _de Coitu_;
  To eten hem alle, he nas no-thing eschu.
  And to his privee freendes thus seyde he:
  'For goddes love, as sone as it may be,                    (570)
  Lat voyden al this hous in curteys wyse.'                   1815
  And they han doon right as he wol devyse.
  Men drinken, and the travers drawe anon;
  The bryde was broght a-bedde as stille as stoon;
  And whan the bed was with the preest y-blessed,
  Out of the chambre hath every wight him dressed.            1820
  And Ianuarie hath faste in armes take
  His fresshe May, his paradys, his make.
  He lulleth hir, he kisseth hir ful ofte
  With thikke bristles of his berd unsofte,                  (580)
  Lyk to the skin of houndfish, sharp as brere,               1825
  For he was shave al newe in his manere.
  He rubbeth hir aboute hir tendre face,
  And seyde thus, 'allas! I moot trespace
  To yow, my spouse, and yow gretly offende,
  Er tyme come that I wil doun descende.                      1830
  But nathelees, considereth this,' quod he,
  'Ther nis no werkman, what-so-ever he be,
  That may bothe werke wel and hastily;
  This wol be doon at leyser parfitly.                       (590)
  It is no fors how longe that we pleye;                      1835
  In trewe wedlok wedded be we tweye;
  And blessed be the yok that we been inne,
  For in our actes we mowe do no sinne.
  A man may do no sinne with his wyf,
  Ne hurte him-selven with his owene knyf;                    1840
  For we han leve to pleye us by the lawe.'
  Thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe;
  And than he taketh a sop in fyn clarree,
  And upright in his bed than sitteth he,                    (600)
  And after that he sang ful loude and clere,                 1845
  [444: T. 9720-9755.]
  And kiste his wyf, and made wantoun chere.
  He was al coltish, ful of ragerye,
  And ful of Iargon as a flekked pye.
  The slakke skin aboute his nekke shaketh,
  Whyl that he sang; so chaunteth he and craketh.             1850
  But god wot what that May thoughte in hir herte,
  Whan she him saugh up sittinge in his sherte,
  In his night-cappe, and with his nekke lene;
  She preyseth nat his pleying worth a bene.                 (610)
  Than seide he thus, 'my reste wol I take;                   1855
  Now day is come, I may no lenger wake.'
  And doun he leyde his heed, and sleep til pryme.
  And afterward, whan that he saugh his tyme,
  Up ryseth Ianuarie; but fresshe May
  Holdeth hir chambre un-to the fourthe day,                  1860
  As usage is of wyves for the beste.
  For every labour som-tyme moot han reste,
  Or elles longe may he nat endure;
  This is to seyn, no lyves creature,                        (620)

  How shaltow to thy lady fresshe May

    This syke Damian in Venus fyr                             1875
  So brenneth, that he dyeth for desyr;
  For which he putte his lyf in aventure,
  No lenger mighte he in this wyse endure;
  But prively a penner gan he borwe,
  And in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe,                      1880
  In manere of a compleynt or a lay,
  [445: T. 9756-9792.]
  Un-to his faire fresshe lady May.
  And in a purs of silk, heng on his sherte,
  He hath it put, and leyde it at his herte.                 (640)

  In halle sit this Ianuarie, and May                         1895
  As fresh as is the brighte someres day.
  And so bifel, how that this gode man
  Remembred him upon this Damian,
  And seyde, 'Seinte Marie! how may this be,
  That Damian entendeth nat to me?                            1900
  Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?'
  His squyeres, whiche that stoden ther bisyde,
  Excused him by-cause of his siknesse,
  Which letted him to doon his bisinesse;                    (660)

  If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe;
  He is as wys, discreet, and as secree
  As any man I woot of his degree;                            1910
  And ther-to manly and eek servisable,

  To doon him al the confort that I can.'                     1915
  And for that word him blessed every man,
  That, of his bountee and his gentillesse,
  He wolde so conforten in siknesse
  [446: T. 9793-9830.]

  At-after mete ye, with your wommen alle,

  Have I no-thing but rested me a lyte;
  And spede yow faste, for I wole abyde

  Confortinge him as goodly as she may.                       1935
  This Damian, whan that his tyme he say,
  In secree wise his purs, and eek his bille,
  In which that he y-writen hadde his wille,
  Hath put in-to hir hand, with-outen more,
  Save that he syketh wonder depe and sore,                   1940
  And softely to hir right thus seyde he:
  'Mercy! and that ye nat discovere me;
  For I am deed, if that this thing be kid.'
  This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hid,                   (700)
  And wente hir wey; ye gete namore of me.                    1945

  Amonges othere of his honest thinges,

  That neither in halle, nin noon other hous,

  That he sholde go biforen with his cliket:
  This Damian thanne hath opened the wiket,
  And in he stirte, and that in swich manere,
  That no wight mighte it see neither y-here;                (910)

  And clapte to the wiket sodeynly.

  Til that he be adawed verraily;                             2400
  Right so a man, that longe hath blind y-be,
  Ne may nat sodeynly so wel y-see,
  First whan his sighte is newe come ageyn,
  As he that hath a day or two y-seyn.                      (1160)
  Til that your sighte y-satled be a whyle,                   2405
  Ther may ful many a sighte yow bigyle.
  Beth war, I prey yow; for, by hevene king,
  Ful many a man weneth to seen a thing,
  And it is al another than it semeth.
  He that misconceyveth, he misdemeth.'                       2410

  And to his palays hoom he hath hir lad.                     2415

  Connen ther-on as muche as any man.'

  HERE BIGINNETH THE SQUIERES TALE.

  At Sarray, in the land of Tartarye,                          (1)
  Ther dwelte a king, that werreyed Russye,                     10
  Thurgh which ther deyde many a doughty man.
  This noble king was cleped Cambinskan,
  Which in his tyme was of so greet renoun
  That ther nas no-wher in no regioun
  So excellent a lord in alle thing;                            15
  Him lakked noght that longeth to a king.
  As of the secte of which that he was born
  He kepte his lay, to which that he was sworn;               (10)
  And ther-to be was hardy, wys, and riche,
  Pitous and Iust, and ever-more y-liche                        20
  [462: T. 10335-10371.]
  Sooth of his word, benigne and honurable,
  Of his corage as any centre stable;
  Yong, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous
  As any bacheler of al his hous.
  A fair persone he was and fortunat,                           25
  And kepte alwey so wel royal estat,
  That ther was nowher swich another man.
  This noble king, this Tartre Cambinskan                     (20)
  Hadde two sones on Elpheta his wyf,
  Of whiche the eldeste highte Algarsyf,                        30
  That other sone was cleped Cambalo.
  A doghter hadde this worthy king also,
  That yongest was, and highte Canacee.
  But for to telle yow al hir beautee,
  It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;                      35
  I dar nat undertake so heigh a thing.
  Myn English eek is insufficient;
  It moste been a rethor excellent,                           (30)
  That coude his colours longing for that art,
  If he sholde hir discryven every part.                        40
  I am non swich, I moot speke as I can.

  Don cryen thurghout Sarray his citee,
  The last Idus of March, after the yeer.
  Phebus the sonne ful Iory was and cleer;                    (40)
  For he was neigh his exaltacioun
  In Martes face, and in his mansioun                           50
  In Aries, the colerik hote signe.
  Ful lusty was the weder and benigne,
  For which the foules, agayn the sonne shene,

  In royal vestiment sit on his deys,
  With diademe, ful heighe in his paleys,                       60
  And halt his feste, so solempne and so riche
  That in this world ne was ther noon it liche.
  Of which if I shal tellen al tharray,
  Than wolde it occupye a someres day;
  And eek it nedeth nat for to devyse                           65
  At every cours the ordre of hir servyse.
  I wol nat tellen of hir strange sewes,
  Ne of hir swannes, ne of hir heronsewes.                    (60)
  Eek in that lond, as tellen knightes olde,
  Ther is som mete that is ful deyntee holde,                   70
  That in this lond men recche of it but smal;
  Ther nis no man that may reporten al.
  I wol nat tarien yow, for it is pryme,
  And for it is no fruit but los of tyme;
  Un-to my firste I wol have my recours.                        75

    And so bifel that, after the thridde cours,
  Whyl that this king sit thus in his nobleye,
  Herkninge his minstralles hir thinges pleye                 (70)
  Biforn him at the bord deliciously,
  In at the halle-dore al sodeynly                              80
  Ther cam a knight up-on a stede of bras,
  And in his hand a brood mirour of glas.
  Upon his thombe he hadde of gold a ring,
  And by his syde a naked swerd hanging;
  And up he rydeth to the heighe bord.                          85
  In al the halle ne was ther spoke a word
  For merveille of this knight; him to biholde
  Ful bisily ther wayten yonge and olde.                      (80)

  Saluëth king and queen, and lordes alle,
  By ordre, as they seten in the halle,
  With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce
  As wel in speche as in contenaunce,
  [464: T. 10409-10444.]
  That Gawain, with his olde curteisye,                         95
  Though he were come ageyn out of Fairye,
  Ne coude him nat amende with a word.
  And after this, biforn the heighe bord,                     (90)
  He with a manly voys seith his message,
  After the forme used in his langage,                         100
  With-outen vyce of sillable or of lettre;
  And, for his tale sholde seme the bettre,
  Accordant to his wordes was his chere,
  As techeth art of speche hem that it lere;
  Al-be-it that I can nat soune his style,                     105
  Ne can nat climben over so heigh a style,
  Yet seye I this, as to commune entente,
  Thus muche amounteth al that ever he mente,                (100)
  If it so be that I have it in minde.

  My lige lord, on this solempne day
  Saluëth yow as he best can and may,
  And sendeth yow, in honour of your feste,
  By me, that am al redy at your heste,
  This stede of bras, that esily and wel                       115
  Can, in the space of o day naturel,
  This is to seyn, in foure and twenty houres,
  Wher-so yow list, in droghte or elles shoures,             (110)
  Beren your body in-to every place
  To which your herte wilneth for to pace                      120
  With-outen wem of yow, thurgh foul or fair;
  Or, if yow list to fleen as hye in the air
  As doth an egle, whan him list to sore,
  This same stede shal bere yow ever-more
  With-outen harm, til ye be ther yow leste,                   125
  Though that ye slepen on his bak or reste;
  And turne ayeyn, with wrything of a pin.
  He that it wroghte coude ful many a gin;                   (120)
  He wayted many a constellacioun
  Er he had doon this operacioun;                              130

    This mirour eek, that I have in myn hond,
  Hath swich a might, that men may in it see
  Whan ther shal fallen any adversitee
  Un-to your regne or to your-self also;                       135
  And openly who is your freend or foo.
  And over al this, if any lady bright
  Hath set hir herte on any maner wight,                     (130)
  If he be fals, she shal his treson see,
  His newe love and al his subtiltee                           140
  So openly, that ther shal no-thing hyde.
  Wherfor, ageyn this lusty someres tyde,
  This mirour and this ring, that ye may see,
  He hath sent to my lady Canacee,
  Your excellente doghter that is here.                        145

    138. E. Pt. in; _rest_ on. 144. E. vn-to; Cm. on-to; _rest_ to.

    The vertu of the ring, if ye wol here,
  Is this; that, if hir lust it for to were
  Up-on hir thombe, or in hir purs it bere,                  (140)
  Ther is no foul that fleeth under the hevene
  That she ne shal wel understonde his stevene,                150
  And knowe his mening openly and pleyn,
  And answere him in his langage ageyn.
  And every gras that groweth up-on rote
  She shal eek knowe, and whom it wol do bote,
  Al be his woundes never so depe and wyde.                    155

    This naked swerd, that hangeth by my syde,
  Swich vertu hath, that what man so ye smyte,
  Thurgh-out his armure it wol kerve and byte,               (150)
  Were it as thikke as is a branched ook;
  And what man that is wounded with the strook                 160
  Shal never be hool til that yow list, of grace,
  To stroke him with the platte in thilke place
  Ther he is hurt: this is as muche to seyn,
  Ye mote with the platte swerd ageyn
  Stroke him in the wounde, and it wol close;                  165
  This is a verray sooth, with-outen glose,
  [466: T. 10481-10516.]
  It failleth nat whyl it is in your hold.'

    158. E. wol hym; _rest omit_ hym.   160. E. a; Cm. that; _rest_ the.

    Stroke.

    And whan this knight hath thus his tale told,            (160)
  He rydeth out of halle, and doun he lighte.
  His stede, which that shoon as sonne brighte,                170
  Stant in the court, as stille as any stoon.
  This knight is to his chambre lad anon,
  And is unarmed and to mete y-set.

    171. Hl. as stille; _rest om._ as.   173. E. vn-to; _the rest_ to.

    The presentes ben ful royally y-fet,
  This is to seyn, the swerd and the mirour,                   175
  And born anon in-to the heighe tour
  With certeine officers ordeyned therfore;
  And un-to Canacee this ring was bore                       (170)
  Solempnely, ther she sit at the table.
  But sikerly, with-outen any fable,                           180
  The hors of bras, that may nat be remewed,
  It stant as it were to the ground y-glewed.
  Ther may no man out of the place it dryve
  For noon engyn of windas or polyve;
  And cause why, for they can nat the craft.                   185
  And therefore in the place they han it laft
  Til that the knight hath taught hem the manere
  To voyden him, as ye shal after here.                      (180)

    178. E. Cm. this; _rest_ the.   184. E. ne; _rest_ or.

    Greet was the prees, that swarmeth to and fro,
  To gauren on this hors that stondeth so;                     190
  For it so heigh was, and so brood and long,
  So wel proporcioned for to ben strong,
  Right as it were a stede of Lumbardye;
  Ther-with so horsly, and so quik of yë
  As it a gentil Poileys courser were.                         195
  For certes, fro his tayl un-to his ere,
  Nature ne art ne coude him nat amende
  In no degree, as al the peple wende.                       (190)
  But evermore hir moste wonder was,
  How that it coude goon, and was of bras;                     200
  It was of Fairye, as the peple semed.
  Diverse folk diversely they demed;
  [467: T. 10517-10552.]
  As many hedes, as many wittes ther been.
  They murmureden as dooth a swarm of been,
  And maden skiles after hir fantasyes,                        205
  Rehersinge of thise olde poetryes,
  And seyden, it was lyk the Pegasee,
  The hors that hadde winges for to flee;                    (200)
  Or elles it was the Grekes hors Synon,
  That broghte Troye to destruccion,                           210
  As men may in thise olde gestes rede,
  'Myn herte,' quod oon, 'is evermore in drede;
  I trowe som men of armes been ther-inne,
  That shapen hem this citee for to winne.
  It were right good that al swich thing were knowe.'          215
  Another rowned to his felawe lowe,
  And seyde, 'he lyeth, it is rather lyk
  An apparence y-maad by som magyk,                          (210)
  As Iogelours pleyen at thise festes grete.'
  Of sondry doutes thus they Iangle and trete,                 220
  As lewed peple demeth comunly
  Of thinges that ben maad more subtilly
  Than they can in her lewednes comprehende;
  They demen gladly to the badder ende.

    And somme of hem wondred on the mirour,                    225
  That born was up in-to the maister-tour,
  How men mighte in it swiche thinges see.
  Another answerde, and seyde it mighte wel be               (220)
  Naturelly, by composiciouns
  Of angles and of slye reflexiouns,                           230
  And seyden, that in Rome was swich oon.
  They speken of Alocen and Vitulon,
  And Aristotle, that writen in hir lyves
  Of queynte mirours and of prospectyves,
  As knowen they that han hir bokes herd.                      235

    And othere folk han wondred on the swerd
  That wolde percen thurgh-out every-thing;
  And fille in speche of Thelophus the king,                 (230)
  [468: T. 10553-10587.]
  And of Achilles with his queynte spere,
  For he coude with it bothe hele and dere,                    240
  Right in swich wyse as men may with the swerd
  Of which right now ye han your-selven herd.
  They speken of sondry harding of metal,
  And speke of medicynes ther-with-al,
  And how, and whanne, it sholde y-harded be;                  245
  Which is unknowe algates unto me.

    239. E. Cm. with; _rest_ for.

    Tho speke they of Canaceës ring,
  And seyden alle, that swich a wonder thing                 (240)
  Of craft of ringes herde they never non,
  Save that he, Moyses, and king Salomon                       250
  Hadde a name of konning in swich art.
  Thus seyn the peple, and drawen hem apart.

  To loven two, as writen folk biforn,
  Ne never, sin the firste man was born,
  Ne coude man, by twenty thousand part,
  Countrefete the sophimes of his art;
  [477: T. 10869-10905.]
  Ne were worthy unbokele his galoche,                         555
  Ther doublenesse or feyning sholde approche,
  Ne so coude thanke a wight as he did me!
  His maner was an heven for to see                          (550)
  Til any womman, were she never so wys;
  So peynted he and kembde at point-devys                      560
  As wel his wordes as his contenaunce.
  And I so lovede him for his obeisaunce,
  And for the trouthe I demed in his herte,
  That, if so were that any thing him smerte,
  Al were it never so lyte, and I it wiste,                    565
  Me thoughte, I felte deeth myn herte twiste.
  And shortly, so ferforth this thing is went,
  That my wil was his willes instrument;                     (560)
  This is to seyn, my wil obeyed his wil
  In alle thing, as fer as reson fil,                          570
  Keping the boundes of my worship ever.
  Ne never hadde I thing so leef, ne lever,
  As him, god woot! ne never shal na-mo.

    This lasteth lenger than a yeer or two,
  That I supposed of him noght but good.                       575
  But fynally, thus atte laste it stood,
  That fortune wolde that he moste twinne
  Out of that place which that I was inne.                   (570)
  Wher me was wo, that is no questioun;
  I can nat make of it discripcioun;                           580
  For o thing dar I tellen boldely,
  I knowe what is the peyne of deth ther-by;
  Swich harm I felte for he ne mighte bileve.
  So on a day of me he took his leve,
  So sorwefully eek, that I wende verraily                     585
  That he had felt as muche harm as I,
  Whan that I herde him speke, and saugh his hewe.
  But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe,                 (580)
  And eek that he repaire sholde ageyn
  With-inne a litel whyle, sooth to seyn;                      590
  And reson wolde eek that he moste go
  [478: T. 10906-10940.]
  For his honour, as ofte it happeth so,
  That I made vertu of necessitee,
  And took it wel, sin that it moste be.
  As I best mighte, I hidde fro him my sorwe,                  595
  And took him by the hond, seint Iohn to borwe,
  And seyde him thus: "lo, I am youres al;
  Beth swich as I to yow have been, and shal."               (590)
  What he answerde, it nedeth noght reherce,
  Who can sey bet than he, who can do werse?                   600
  Whan he hath al wel seyd, thanne hath he doon.
  "Therfor bihoveth him a ful long spoon
  That shal ete with a feend," thus herde I seye.
  So atte laste he moste forth his weye,
  And forth he fleeth, til he cam ther him leste.              605
  Whan it cam him to purpos for to reste,
  I trowe he hadde thilke text in minde,
  That "alle thing, repairing to his kinde,                  (600)
  Gladeth him-self"; thus seyn men, as I gesse;
  Men loven of propre kinde newfangelnesse,                    610
  As briddes doon that men in cages fede.
  For though thou night and day take of hem hede,
  And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk,
  And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk,
  Yet right anon, as that his dore is uppe,                    615
  He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe,
  And to the wode he wol and wormes ete;
  So newefangel been they of hir mete,                       (610)
  And loven novelryes of propre kinde;
  No gentillesse of blood [ne] may hem binde.                  620
  So ferde this tercelet, allas the day!
  Though he were gentil born, and fresh and gay,
  And goodly for to seen, and humble and free,
  He saugh up-on a tyme a kyte flee,
  And sodeynly he loved this kyte so,                          625
  That al his love is clene fro me ago,
  [479: T. 10941-10974.]
  And hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse;
  Thus hath the kyte my love in hir servyse,                 (620)
  And I am lorn with-outen remedye!'
  And with that word this faucon gan to crye,                  630
  And swowned eft in Canaceës barme.

  HERE BIGINNETH THE FRANKELEYNS TALE.

  In Armorik, that called is Britayne,
  Ther was a knight that loved and dide his payne              730
  To serve a lady in his beste wyse;
  And many a labour, many a greet empryse
  He for his lady wroghte, er she were wonne.
  For she was oon, the faireste under sonne,
  And eek therto come of so heigh kinrede,                     735
  That wel unnethes dorste this knight, for drede,
  Telle hir his wo, his peyne, and his distresse.
  But atte laste, she, for his worthinesse,                   (10)
  And namely for his meke obeysaunce,
  Hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce,                   740
  That prively she fil of his accord
  To take him for hir housbonde and hir lord,
  Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves;
  And for to lede the more in blisse hir lyves,
  Of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight,                    745
  That never in al his lyf he, day ne night,
  Ne sholde up-on him take no maistrye
  Agayn hir wil, ne kythe hir Ialousye,                       (20)
  But hir obeye, and folwe hir wil in al
  As any lovere to his lady shal;                              750
  Save that the name of soveraynetee,
  That wolde he have for shame of his degree.

    She thanked him, and with ful greet humblesse
  She seyde, 'sire, sith of your gentillesse
  Ye profre me to have so large a reyne,                       755
  Ne wolde never god bitwixe us tweyne,
  [484: T. 11069-11106.]
  As in my gilt, were outher werre or stryf.
  Sir, I wol be your humble trewe wyf,                        (30)
  Have heer my trouthe, til that myn herte breste.'
  Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.                 760

    For o thing, sires, saufly dar I seye,
  That frendes everich other moot obeye,
  If they wol longe holden companye.
  Love wol nat ben constreyned by maistrye;
  Whan maistrie comth, the god of love anon                    765
  Beteth hise winges, and farewel! he is gon!
  Love is a thing as any spirit free;
  Wommen of kinde desiren libertee,                           (40)
  And nat to ben constreyned as a thral;
  And so don men, if I soth seyen shal.                        770
  Loke who that is most pacient in love,
  He is at his avantage al above.
  Pacience is an heigh vertu certeyn;
  For it venquisseth, as thise clerkes seyn,
  Thinges that rigour sholde never atteyne.                    775
  For every word men may nat chyde or pleyne.
  Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon,
  Ye shul it lerne, wher-so ye wole or noon.                  (50)
  For in this world, certein, ther no wight is,
  That he ne dooth or seith som-tyme amis.                     780
  Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun,
  Wyn, wo, or chaunginge of complexioun
  Causeth ful ofte to doon amis or speken.
  On every wrong a man may nat be wreken;
  After the tyme, moste be temperaunce                         785
  To every wight that can on governaunce.
  And therfore hath this wyse worthy knight,
  To live in ese, suffrance hir bihight,                      (60)
  And she to him ful wisly gan to swere
  That never sholde ther be defaute in here.                   790

    772. E. auantate (_sic_).

    Heer may men seen an humble wys accord;
  Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord,
  Servant in love, and lord in mariage;
  Than was he bothe in lordship and servage;
  [485: T. 11107-11144.]
  Servage? nay, but in lordshipe above,                        795
  Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love;
  His lady, certes, and his wyf also,
  The which that lawe of love acordeth to.                    (70)
  And whan he was in this prosperitee,
  Hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree,                   800
  Nat fer fro Penmark, ther his dwelling was,
  Wher-as he liveth in blisse and in solas.

  The Ioye, the ese, and the prosperitee
  That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?                    805
  A yeer and more lasted this blisful lyf,
  Til that the knight of which I speke of thus,
  That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus,                       (80)
  Shoop him to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweyne
  In Engelond, that cleped was eek Briteyne,                   810
  To seke in armes worship and honour;
  For al his lust he sette in swich labour;

  That loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf.
  For his absence wepeth she and syketh,
  As doon thise noble wyves whan hem lyketh.                  (90)
  She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth;
  Desyr of his presence hir so distreyneth,                    820
  That al this wyde world she sette at noght.
  Hir frendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,
  Conforten hir in al that ever they may;
  They prechen hir, they telle hir night and day,
  That causelees she sleeth hir-self, allas!                   825
  And every confort possible in this cas
  They doon to hir with al hir bisinesse,

  Men may so longe graven in a stoon,                          830
  Til som figure ther-inne emprented be.
  So longe han they conforted hir, til she
  [486: T. 11145-11181.]
  Receyved hath, by hope and by resoun,
  The emprenting of hir consolacioun,
  Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;                     835
  She may nat alwey duren in swich rage.

    And eek Arveragus, in al this care,
  Hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare,                 (110)
  And that he wol come hastily agayn;
  Or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.                   840

    Hir freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake,
  And preyede hir on knees, for goddes sake,
  To come and romen hir in companye,
  Awey to dryve hir derke fantasye.
  And finally, she graunted that requeste;                     845
  For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.

    Now stood hir castel faste by the see,
  And often with hir freendes walketh she                    (120)
  Hir to disporte up-on the bank an heigh,
  Wher-as she many a ship and barge seigh                      850
  Seilinge hir cours, wher-as hem liste go;
  But than was that a parcel of hir wo.
  For to hir-self ful ofte 'allas!' seith she,
  'Is ther no ship, of so manye as I see,
  Wol bringen hom my lord? than were myn herte                 855
  Al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte.'

    Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thinke,
  And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke.                (130)
  But whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake,
  For verray fere so wolde hir herte quake,                    860
  That on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene.
  Than wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,
  And pitously in-to the see biholde,
  And seyn right thus, with sorweful sykes colde:

    862. E. Thanne.

    'Eterne god, that thurgh thy purveyaunce                   865
  Ledest the world by certein governaunce,
  In ydel, as men seyn, ye no-thing make;
  But, lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake,              (140)
  That semen rather a foul confusioun
  [487: T. 11182-11217.]
  Of werk than any fair creacioun                              870
  Of swich a parfit wys god and a stable,
  Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?
  For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest,
  Ther nis y-fostred man, ne brid, ne beest;
  It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth.                    875
  See ye nat, lord, how mankinde it destroyeth?
  An hundred thousand bodies of mankinde
  Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in minde,                 (150)
  Which mankinde is so fair part of thy werk
  That thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk.                  880
  Than semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee
  Toward mankinde; but how than may it be
  That ye swiche menes make it to destroyen,
  Whiche menes do no good, but ever anoyen?
  I wool wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste,                   885
  By arguments, that al is for the beste,
  Though I ne can the causes nat y-knowe.
  But thilke god, that made wind to blowe,                   (160)
  As kepe my lord! this my conclusioun;
  To clerkes lete I al disputisoun.                            890
  But wolde god that alle thise rokkes blake
  Were sonken in-to helle for his sake!
  Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the fere.'
  Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous tere.

    Hir freendes sawe that it was no disport                   895
  To romen by the see, but disconfort;
  And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles.
  They leden hir by riveres and by welles,                   (170)
  And eek in othere places delitables;
  They dauncen, and they pleyen at ches and tables.            900

    So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
  Un-to a gardin that was ther bisyde,
  In which that they had maad hir ordinaunce
  Of vitaille and of other purveyaunce,
  They goon and pleye hem al the longe day.                    905
  [488: T. 11218-11253.]
  And this was on the sixte morwe of May,
  Which May had peynted with his softe shoures
  This gardin ful of leves and of floures;                   (180)
  And craft of mannes hand so curiously
  Arrayed hadde this gardin, trewely,                          910
  That never was ther gardin of swich prys,
  But-if it were the verray paradys.
  The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte
  Wolde han maad any herte for to lighte
  That ever was born, but-if to gret siknesse,                 915
  Or to gret sorwe helde it in distresse;
  So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.
  At-after diner gonne they to daunce,                       (190)
  And singe also, save Dorigen allone,
  Which made alwey hir compleint and hir mone;                 920
  For she ne saugh him on the daunce go,
  That was hir housbonde and hir love also.
  But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde,
  And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.

    Up-on this daunce, amonges othere men,                     925
  Daunced a squyer biforen Dorigen,
  That fressher was and Iolyer of array,
  As to my doom, than is the monthe of May.                  (200)
  He singeth, daunceth, passinge any man
  That is, or was, sith that the world bigan.                  930
  Ther-with he was, if men sholde him discryve,
  Oon of the beste faringe man on-lyve;
  Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche and wys,
  And wel biloved, and holden in gret prys.
  And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal,                     935

  This lusty squyer, servant to Venus,
  Which that y-cleped was Aurelius,                          (210)
  Had loved hir best of any creature
  Two yeer and more, as was his aventure,                      940
  But never dorste he telle hir his grevaunce;
  [489: T. 11254-11290.]
  With-outen coppe he drank al his penaunce.
  He was despeyred, no-thing dorste he seye,
  Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye
  His wo, as in a general compleyning;                         945
  He seyde he lovede, and was biloved no-thing.
  Of swich matere made he manye layes,
  Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,                  (220)
  How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,
  But languissheth, as a furie dooth in helle;                 950
  And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko
  For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo.
  In other manere than ye here me seye,
  Ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye;
  Save that, paraventure, som-tyme at daunces,                 955
  Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,
  It may wel be he loked on hir face
  In swich a wyse, as man that asketh grace;                 (230)
  But no-thing wiste she of his entente.
  Nathelees, it happed, er they thennes wente,                 960
  By-cause that he was hir neighebour,
  And was a man of worship and honour,
  And hadde y-knowen him of tyme yore,
  They fille in speche; and forth more and more
  Un-to his purpos drough Aurelius,                            965

  So that I wiste it mighte your herte glade,                (240)
  I wolde, that day that your Arveragus
  Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,                        970
  Had went ther never I sholde have come agayn;
  For wel I woot my service is in vayn.
  My guerdon is but bresting of myn herte;
  Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte;
  For with a word ye may me sleen or save,                     975

  [490: T. 11291-11327.]

  'Is this your wil,' quod she, 'and sey ye thus?              980
  Never erst,' quod she, 'ne wiste I what ye mente.
  But now, Aurelie, I knowe your entente,
  By thilke god that yaf me soule and lyf,
  Ne shal I never been untrewe wyf
  In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit:                       985
  I wol ben his to whom that I am knit;
  Tak this for fynal answer as of me.'

  Sin I yow see so pitously complayne;
  Loke what day that, endelong Britayne,
  Ye remoeve alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon,
  That they ne lette ship ne boot to goon--
  I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so clene                  995

  Than wol I love yow best of any man;

  For wel I woot that it shal never bityde.
  Lat swiche folies out of your herte slyde.
  What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf
  For to go love another mannes wyf,
  That hath hir body whan so that him lyketh?'                1005

    Aurelius ful ofte sore syketh;
  Wo was Aurelie, whan that he this herde,
  And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:                (280)

    'Madame,' quod he, 'this were an inpossible!
  Than moot I dye of sodein deth horrible.'                   1010
  And with that word he turned him anoon.
  Tho come hir othere freendes many oon,
  And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,
  And no-thing wiste of this conclusioun,
  But sodeinly bigonne revel newe                             1015

  For thorisonte hath reft the sonne his light;
  This is as muche to seye as it was night.                  (290)
  And hoom they goon in Ioye and in solas,
  Save only wrecche Aurelius, allas!                          1020
  He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte;

  Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde,
  And on his knowes bare he sette him doun,                   1025
  And in his raving seyde his orisoun.
  For verray wo out of his wit he breyde.
  He niste what he spak, but thus he seyde;                  (300)

    In langour and in torment furious
  Two yeer and more lay wrecche Aurelius,

  Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,
  Save of his brother, which that was a clerk;                1105
  He knew of al this wo and al this werk.
  For to non other creature certeyn
  Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.                     (380)
  Under his brest he bar it more secree
  Than ever dide Pamphilus for Galathee.                      1110
  His brest was hool, with-oute for to sene,
  But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.
  And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure
  In surgerye is perilous the cure,
  But men mighte touche the arwe, or come therby.             1115
  His brother weep and wayled prively,
  Til atte laste him fil in remembraunce,
  That whyl he was at Orliens in Fraunce,                    (390)
  As yonge clerkes, that been likerous
  To reden artes that been curious,                           1120
  Seken in every halke and every herne
  Particuler sciences for to lerne,
  He him remembred that, upon a day,
  At Orliens in studie a book he say
  [494: T. 11437-11471.]
  Of magik natural, which his felawe,                         1125
  That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe,
  Al were he ther to lerne another craft,
  Had prively upon his desk y-laft;                          (400)
  Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns,
  Touchinge the eighte and twenty mansiouns                   1130
  That longen to the mone, and swich folye,
  As in our dayes is nat worth a flye;
  For holy chirches feith in our bileve
  Ne suffreth noon illusion us to greve.
  And whan this book was in his remembraunce,                 1135
  Anon for Ioye his herte gan to daunce,
  And to him-self he seyde prively:
  'My brother shal be warisshed hastily;                     (410)
  For I am siker that ther be sciences,
  By whiche men make diverse apparences                       1140
  Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye.
  For ofte at festes have I wel herd seye,
  That tregetours, with-inne an halle large,
  Have maad come in a water and a barge,
  And in the halle rowen up and doun.                         1145

    Whan they were come almost to that citee,
  But-if it were a two furlong or three,
  A yong clerk rominge by him-self they mette,
  Which that in Latin thriftily hem grette,
  And after that he seyde a wonder thing:                     1175
  'I knowe,' quod he, 'the cause of your coming';
  And er they ferther any fote wente,
  He tolde hem al that was in hir entente.                   (450)

    Aurelius gan wondren on this cas,
  And in his herte had greet compassioun                      1515
  Of hir and of hir lamentacioun,
  And of Arveragus, the worthy knight,
  That bad hir holden al that she had hight,                 (790)
  So looth him was his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe;
  And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe,           1520
  Consideringe the beste on every syde,
  That fro his lust yet were him lever abyde
  Than doon so heigh a cherlish wrecchednesse

    Arveragus and Dorigene his wyf
  In sovereyn blisse leden forth hir lyf.
  Never eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene;

  And she was to him trewe for evermore.                      1555

    Aurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn,
  Curseth the tyme that ever he was born:                    (830)
  'Allas,' quod he, 'allas! that I bihighte
  Of pured gold a thousand pound of wighte                    1560
  Un-to this philosophre! how shal I do?
  I see na-more but that I am fordo.

  And been a begger; heer may I nat dwelle,
  And shamen al my kinrede in this place,                     1565
  But I of him may gete bettre grace.

  At certeyn dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye,                   (840)
  And thanke him of his grete curteisye;

    With herte soor he gooth un-to his cofre,
  And broghte gold un-to this philosophre,

  And him bisecheth, of his gentillesse,
  To graunte him dayes of the remenaunt,                      1575
  And seyde, 'maister, I dar wel make avaunt,

  For sikerly my dette shal be quit                          (850)

  [507: T. 11890-11924.]
  And seyde thus, whan he thise wordes herde:
  'Have I nat holden covenant un-to thee?'
  'Yes, certes, wel and trewely,' quod he.                   (860)
  'Hastow nat had thy lady as thee lyketh?'
  'No, no,' quod he, and sorwefully he syketh.                1590
  'What was the cause? tel me if thou can.'

  And tolde him al, as ye han herd bifore;
  It nedeth nat to yow reherce it more.

    He seide, 'Arveragus, of gentillesse,                     1595

  How looth hir was to been a wikked wyf,
  And that she lever had lost that day hir lyf,               1600
  And that hir trouthe she swoor, thurgh innocence:
  'She never erst herde speke of apparence;
  That made me han of hir so greet pitee.
  And right as frely as he sente hir me,
  As frely sente I hir to him ageyn.                          1605

  But god forbede, for his blisful might,                     1610

  Or elles, lo! this maydens name bright

  For 'leos' 'peple' in English is to seye,
  And right as men may in the hevene see

  HERE BIGINNETH THE SECONDE NONNES TALE, OF THE LYF OF SEINTE CECILE.

  This mayden bright Cecilie, as hir lyf seith,                120
  Was comen of Romayns, and of noble kinde,
  And from hir cradel up fostred in the feith
  Of Crist, and bar his gospel in hir minde;
  She never cessed, as I writen finde,
  Of hir preyere, and god to love and drede,                   125
  Biseking him to kepe hir maydenhede.

  And when this mayden sholde unto a man
  Y-wedded be, that was ful yong of age,
  Which that y-cleped was Valerian,
  And day was comen of hir mariage,                            130
  She, ful devout and humble in hir corage,
  Under hir robe of gold, that sat ful fayre,
  Had next hir flesh y-clad hir in an heyre.

  And whyl the organs maden melodye,
  To god alone in herte thus sang she;                         135
  'O lord, my soule and eek my body gye
  Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be:'
  And, for his love that deyde upon a tree,
  Every seconde or thridde day she faste,
  Ay biddinge in hir orisons ful faste.                        140

  The night cam, and to bedde moste she gon
  With hir housbonde, as ofte is the manere,
  And prively to him she seyde anon,
  'O swete and wel biloved spouse dere,
  Ther is a conseil, and ye wolde it here,                     145
  Which that right fain I wolde unto yow seye,

  He sholde never-mo biwreyen here;                            150
  And thanne at erst to him thus seyde she,
  'I have an angel which that loveth me,
  That with greet love, wher-so I wake or slepe,
  Is redy ay my body for to kepe.

  And if that he may felen, out of drede,                      155

  And in your yowthe thus ye shulden dye;
  And if that ye in clene love me gye,
  He wol yow loven as me, for your clennesse,                  160
  And shewen yow his Ioye and his brightnesse.'

  Valerian, corrected as god wolde,
  Answerde agayn, 'if I shal trusten thee,
  Lat me that angel se, and him biholde;
  And if that it a verray angel be,                            165

  So that ye trowe on Crist and yow baptyse.
  Goth forth to Via Apia,' quod she,
  'That fro this toun ne stant but myles three,

  And whan that ye seint Urban han biholde,
  Telle him the wordes whiche I to yow tolde;                  180

  And he anon, with-outen taryinge,

  Urban for Ioye his hondes gan up holde.

  The teres from his yën leet he falle--                       190
  'Almighty lord, o Iesu Crist,' quod he,
  'Sower of chast conseil, herde of us alle,

  This angel hadde of roses and of lilie                       220
  Corones two, the which he bar in honde;
  And first to Cecile, as I understonde,
  He yaf that oon, and after gan he take
  That other to Valerian, hir make.

  'With body clene and with unwemmed thoght                    225
  Kepeth ay wel thise corones,' quod he;
  'Fro Paradys to yow have I hem broght,
  Ne never-mo ne shal they roten be,
  Ne lese her sote savour, trusteth me;
  Ne never wight shal seen hem with his yë,                    230

  'That in this world I love no man so.
  I pray yow that my brother may han grace
  To knowe the trouthe, as I do in this place.'

  [517: T. 15707-15737.]
  The angel seyde, 'god lyketh thy requeste,
  And bothe, with the palm of martirdom,                       240
  Ye shullen come unto his blisful feste.'
  And with that word Tiburce his brother com.
  And whan that he the savour undernom
  Which that the roses and the lilies caste,
  With-inne his herte he gan to wondre faste,                  245

  And seyde, 'I wondre, this tyme of the yeer,
  Whennes that sote savour cometh so
  Of rose and lilies that I smelle heer.
  For though I hadde hem in myn hondes two,
  The savour mighte in me no depper go.                        250
  The sote smel that in myn herte I finde

  Whiche that thyn yën han no might to see;                    255
  And as thou smellest hem thurgh my preyere,
  So shaltow seen hem, leve brother dere,
  If it so be thou wolt, withouten slouthe,
  Bileve aright and knowen verray trouthe.'

  Tiburce answerde, 'seistow this to me                        260
  In soothnesse, or in dreem I herkne this?'
  'In dremes,' quod Valerian, 'han we be
  Unto this tyme, brother myn, y-wis.
  But now at erst in trouthe our dwelling is.'
  'How woostow this,' quod Tiburce, 'in what wyse?'            265
  Quod Valerian, 'that shal I thee devyse.

  The angel of god hath me the trouthe y-taught
  Which thou shalt seen, if that thou wolt reneye
  The ydoles and be clene, and elles naught.'--
  [518: T. 15738-15769.]

  'To whom?' quod he, 'com forth with right good chere,

  And whyl we seken thilke divinitee

  If this were livinge only and non other.

  That ther was other lyf ther men may wone.'
  To whom answerde Tiburce, 'o suster dere,

  And now of three how maystow bere witnesse?'

  And after this Tiburce, in good entente,

  That thanked god; and with glad herte and light
  He cristned him, and made him in that place
  Parfit in his lerninge, goddes knight.
  And after this Tiburce gat swich grace,

  That every cristen wight shal han penaunce
  But-if that he his cristendom withseye,
  And goon al quit, if he wol it reneye?'

  'Your princes erren, as your nobley dooth,'
  Quod tho Cecile, 'and with a wood sentence                   450
  Ye make us gilty, and it is nat sooth;
  For ye, that knowen wel our innocence,
  For as muche as we doon a reverence

  'Lo! he dissimuleth here in audience,

  Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked.'
  'Do wey thy boldnes,' seyde Almachius tho,
  'And sacrifyce to our goddes, er thou go;
  I recche nat what wrong that thou me profre,
  For I can suffre it as a philosophre;                        490

  THE PROLOGE OF THE CHANONS YEMANNES TALE.

  Whan ended was the lyf of seint Cecyle,
  Er we had riden fully fyve myle,                             555
  At Boghton under Blee us gan atake
  A man, that clothed was in clothes blake,
  And undernethe he hadde a whyt surplys.
  His hakeney, that was al pomely grys,
  So swatte, that it wonder was to see;                        560
  It semed he had priked myles three.
  The hors eek that his yeman rood upon
  So swatte, that unnethe mighte it gon.                      (10)
  Aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye,
  He was of fome al flekked as a pye.                          565
  A male tweyfold on his croper lay,
  It semed that he caried lyte array.
  Al light for somer rood this worthy man,
  And in myn herte wondren I bigan
  What that he was, til that I understood                      570
  How that his cloke was sowed to his hood;
  For which, when I had longe avysed me,
  I demed him som chanon for to be.                           (20)
  His hat heng at his bak doun by a laas,
  For he had riden more than trot or paas;                     575
  [528: T. 16044-16079.]
  He had ay priked lyk as he were wood.
  A clote-leef he hadde under his hood
  For swoot, and for to kepe his heed from hete.
  But it was Ioye for to seen him swete!
  His forheed dropped as a stillatorie,                        580
  Were ful of plantain and of paritorie.
  And whan that he was come, he gan to crye,
  'God save,' quod he, 'this Ioly companye!                   (30)
  Faste have I priked,' quod he, 'for your sake,
  By-cause that I wolde yow atake,                             585
  To ryden in this mery companye.'
  His yeman eek was ful of curteisye,
  And seyde, 'sires, now in the morwe-tyde
  Out of your hostelrye I saugh you ryde,
  And warned heer my lord and my soverayn,                     590

  For mochel good, I dar leye in balaunce

  Is he a clerk, or noon? tel what he is.'

    'Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, y-wis,'
  Seyde this yeman, 'and in wordes fewe,
  Host, of his craft som-what I wol yow shewe.

    I seye, my lord can swich subtilitee--                     620

  And som-what helpe I yet to his werking)--
  That al this ground on which we been ryding,                (70)
  Til that we come to Caunterbury toun,
  He coude al clene turne it up-so-doun,                       625
  And pave it al of silver and of gold.'

    And whan this yeman hadde thus y-told
  Unto our host, he seyde, '_benedicite!_
  This thing is wonder merveillous to me,
  Sin that thy lord is of so heigh prudence,                   630
  By-cause of which men sholde him reverence,
  That of his worship rekketh he so lyte;
  His oversloppe nis nat worth a myte,                        (80)
  As in effect, to him, so mote I go!
  It is al baudy and to-tore also.                             635
  Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee preye,
  And is of power better cloth to beye,
  If that his dede accorde with thy speche?
  Telle me that, and that I thee biseche.'

    627. E. this tale; Cm. this; _rest_ thus.

    'Why?' quod this yeman, 'wherto axe ye me?                 640

  (But I wol nat avowe that I seye,
  And therfor kepe it secree, I yow preye).                   (90)
  He is to wys, in feith, as I bileve;
  That that is overdoon, it wol nat preve                      645
  Aright, as clerkes seyn, it is a vyce.
  Wherfor in that I holde him lewed and nyce.
  For whan a man hath over-greet a wit,
  Ful oft him happeth to misusen it;
  [530: T. 16118-16154.]
  So dooth my lord, and that me greveth sore.                  650
  God it amende, I can sey yow na-more.'

    'Ther-of no fors, good yeman,' quod our host;
  'Sin of the conning of thy lord thou wost,                 (100)
  Tel how he dooth, I pray thee hertely,
  Sin that he is so crafty and so sly.                         655
  Wher dwellen ye, if it to telle be?'

    'In the suburbes of a toun,' quod he,
  'Lurkinge in hernes and in lanes blinde,
  Wher-as thise robbours and thise theves by kinde
  Holden hir privee fereful residence,                         660

  That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.

  For ever we lakken our conclusioun.
  To mochel folk we doon illusioun,                          (120)
  And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,
  Or ten, or twelve, or many sommes mo,                        675
  And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye,
  That of a pound we coude make tweye!
  Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope
  It for to doon, and after it we grope.
  But that science is so fer us biforn,                        680
  We mowen nat, al-though we hadde it sworn,
  It overtake, it slit awey so faste;

  Of mennes speche ever hadde this chanoun.
  For Catoun seith, that he that gilty is
  Demeth al thing be spoke of him, y-wis.
  That was the cause he gan so ny him drawe                    690
  To his yeman, to herknen al his sawe.
  And thus he seyde un-to his yeman tho,
  'Hold thou thy pees, and spek no wordes mo,                (140)
  For if thou do, thou shalt it dere abye;
  Thou sclaundrest me heer in this companye,                   695

  But his yeman wolde telle his privetee,
  He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame.

    'A!' quod the yeman, 'heer shal aryse game,              (150)
  Al that I can anon now wol I telle.
  Sin he is goon, the foule feend him quelle!                  705
  For never her-after wol I with him mete
  For peny ne for pound, I yow bihete!
  He that me broghte first unto that game,
  Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame!
  For it is ernest to me, by my feith;                         710
  That fele I wel, what so any man seith.
  And yet, for al my smert and al my grief,
  For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,                     (160)
  I coude never leve it in no wyse.
  Now wolde god my wit mighte suffyse                          715

  With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,                   720
  And of his science am I never the neer.
  Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by;
  And god wot, so hath many mo than I.                       (170)
  Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay
  Of clothing and of other good array,                         725
  Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
  And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed,

  That I have no good, wher that ever I fare;                (180)
  And yet I am endetted so ther-by
  Of gold that I have borwed, trewely,                         735
  That whyl I live, I shal it quyte never.
  Lat every man be war by me for ever!
  What maner man that casteth him ther-to,
  If he continue, I holde his thrift y-do.
  So helpe me god, ther-by shal he nat winne,                  740
  But empte his purs, and make his wittes thinne.
  And whan he, thurgh his madnes and folye,
  Hath lost his owene good thurgh Iupartye,                  (190)
  [533: T. 16212-16246.]

  To lese hir good as he him-self hath do.                     745
  For unto shrewes Ioye it is and ese
  To have hir felawes in peyne and disese;

  As on fyve or sixe ounces, may wel be,
  Of silver or som other quantite,
  And bisie me to telle yow the names
  Of orpiment, brent bones, yren squames,

  Which that was maad, and of the care and wo
  That we hadde in our matires sublyming,                      770

  For al the good he spendeth ther-aboute,

  And every man that oght hath in his cofre,
  Lat him appere, and wexe a philosofre.
  Ascaunce that craft is so light to lere?
  Nay, nay, god woot, al be he monk or frere,

  Of alle thise names now wol I me reste.

  For al our craft, whan we han al y-do,

  For sorwe of which almost we wexen wood,
  But that good hope crepeth in our herte,                     870
  Supposinge ever, though we sore smerte,
  To be releved by him afterward;
  Swich supposing and hope is sharp and hard;                (320)
  I warne yow wel, it is to seken ever;
  That futur temps hath maad men to dissever,                  875
  In trust ther-of, from al that ever they hadde.
  Yet of that art they can nat wexen sadde,
  For unto hem it is a bitter swete;

  Which that they mighte wrappe hem inne a-night,              880
  And a bak to walken inne by day-light,
  They wolde hem selle and spenden on this craft;

  Men may hem knowe by smel of brimstoon;                      885

  And seyn, that if that they espyed were,                     895

  That therin dwelled hadde many a yeer,                     (460)
  Which was so plesaunt and so servisable
  Unto the wyf, wher-as he was at table,                      1015
  That she wolde suffre him no-thing for to paye
  For bord ne clothing, wente he never so gaye;
  And spending-silver hadde he right y-now.
  Therof no fors; I wol precede as now,
  And telle forth my tale of the chanoun,                     1020
  [541: T. 16489-16524.]

    This false chanoun cam up-on a day
  Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay,                   (470)
  Biseching him to lene him a certeyn
  Of gold, and he wolde quyte it him ageyn.                   1025
  'Lene me a mark,' quod he, 'but dayes three,
  And at my day I wol it quyten thee.
  And if so be that thou me finde fals,
  Another day do hange me by the hals!'

    This preest him took a mark, and that as swythe,          1030
  And this chanoun him thanked ofte sythe,
  And took his leve, and wente forth his weye,
  And at the thridde day broghte his moneye,                 (480)
  And to the preest he took his gold agayn,
  Wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn.                1035

    'Certes,' quod he, 'no-thing anoyeth me
  To lene a man a noble, or two or three,
  Or what thing were in my possessioun,
  Whan he so trewe is of condicioun,
  That in no wyse he breke wol his day;                       1040
  To swich a man I can never seye nay.'

    'What!' quod this chanoun, 'sholde I be untrewe?
  Nay, that were thing y-fallen al of-newe.                  (490)
  Trouthe is a thing that I wol ever kepe

  'Though povre I be, crafty thou shalt me finde;             1290
  I warne thee, yet is ther more bihinde.
  Is ther any coper her-inne?' seyde he.
  'Ye,' quod the preest, 'sir, I trowe wel ther be.'         (740)

    He wente his wey, and with the coper cam,
  And this chanoun it in his handes nam,
  And of that coper weyed out but an ounce.
  Al to simple is my tonge to pronounce,
  As ministre of my wit, the doublenesse                      1300
  Of this chanoun, rote of al cursednesse.
  He semed freendly to hem that knewe him noght,
  But he was feendly bothe in herte and thoght.              (750)
  It werieth me to telle of his falsnesse,
  And nathelees yet wol I it expresse,                        1305
  To thentente that men may be war therby,
  And for noon other cause, trewely.

    He putte his ounce of coper in the croslet,
  And on the fyr as swythe he hath it set,
  And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,          1310
  And in his werking for to stoupe lowe,
  As he dide er, and al nas but a Iape;
  Right as him liste, the preest he made his ape;            (760)
  And afterward in the ingot he it caste,
  And in the panne putte it at the laste                      1315
  Of water, and in he putte his owene hond.
  And in his sleve (as ye biforn-hond
  Herde me telle) he hadde a silver teyne.
  He slyly took it out, this cursed heyne--
  Unwiting this preest of his false craft--                   1320
  And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;
  And in the water rombled to and fro,
  And wonder prively took up also                            (770)
  The coper teyne, noght knowing this preest,
  And hidde it, and him hente by the breest,                  1325
  And to him spak, and thus seyde in his game,
  'Stoupeth adoun, by god, ye be to blame,
  Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whyl-er,
  Putte in your hand, and loketh what is ther.'

    This preest took up this silver teyne anon,               1330
  And thanne seyde the chanoun, 'lat us gon
  [550: T. 16800-16836.]
  With thise three teynes, which that we han wroght,
  To som goldsmith, and wite if they been oght.              (780)
  For, by my feith, I nolde, for myn hood,
  But-if that they were silver, fyn and good,                 1335
  And that as swythe preved shal it be.'

    1336. E. it shal; Ln. schal he; _rest_ shal it.

    Un-to the goldsmith with thise teynes three
  They wente, and putte thise teynes in assay
  To fyr and hamer; mighte no man sey nay,
  But that they weren as hem oghte be.                        1340

    1339. E. seye; Cm. sey.

    This sotted preest, who was gladder than he?
  Was never brid gladder agayn the day,
  Ne nightingale, in the sesoun of May,                      (790)
  Nas never noon that luste bet to singe;
  Ne lady lustier in carolinge                                1345
  Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,
  Ne knight in armes to doon an hardy dede
  To stonde in grace of his lady dere,
  Than had this preest this sory craft to lere;
  And to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde,                  1350
  'For love of god, that for us alle deyde,
  And as I may deserve it un-to yow,
  What shal this receit coste? telleth now!'                 (800)

    1344. E. man; _rest_ noon (non).   1353. E. receite; Lichf. Cp. Hl.

    'By our lady,' quod this chanoun, 'it is dere,
  I warne yow wel; for, save I and a frere,                   1355
  In Engelond ther can no man it make.'

    'No fors,' quod he, 'now, sir, for goddes sake,
  What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye.'

    'Y-wis,' quod he, 'it is ful dere, I seye;
  Sir, at o word, if that thee list it have,                  1360
  Ye shul paye fourty pound, so god me save!
  And, nere the freendship that ye dide er this
  To me, ye sholde paye more, y-wis.'                        (810)

    This preest the somme of fourty pound anon
  Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon                     1365
  To this chanoun, for this ilke receit;
  Al his werking nas but fraude and deceit.

    'Sir preest,' he seyde, 'I kepe han no loos
  [551: T. 16837-16871.]
  Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were cloos;
  And as ye love me, kepeth it secree;                        1370
  For, and men knewe al my subtilitee,
  By god, they wolden han so greet envye
  To me, by-cause of my philosophye,                         (820)

  Than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef.'

    1377. E. or; _rest_ and.

    'For your good wil, sir, have ye right good preef,'
  Quod the chanoun, 'and far-wel, grant mercy!'               1380
  He wente his wey and never the preest him sy
  After that day; and whan that this preest sholde
  Maken assay, at swich tyme as he wolde,                    (830)
  Of this receit, far-wel! it wolde nat be!
  Lo, thus byiaped and bigyled was he!                        1385
  Thus maketh he his introduccioun
  To bringe folk to hir destruccioun.--

    1387. E. Cm. _omit_ hir.

    Considereth, sirs, how that, in ech estaat,
  Bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat
  So ferforth, that unnethes is ther noon.                    1390
  This multiplying blent so many oon,
  That in good feith I trowe that it be
  The cause grettest of swich scarsetee.                     (840)
  Philosophres speken so mistily
  In this craft, that men can nat come therby,                1395
  For any wit that men han now a-dayes.
  They mowe wel chiteren, as doon thise Iayes,
  And in her termes sette hir lust and peyne,
  But to hir purpos shul they never atteyne.
  A man may lightly lerne, if he have aught,                  1400

  A mannes mirthe it wol torne un-to grame,                  (850)
  [552: T. 16872-16907.]
  And empten also grete and hevy purses,
  And maken folk for to purchasen curses                      1405
  Of hem, that han hir good therto y-lent.
  O! fy! for shame! they that han been brent,
  Allas! can they nat flee the fyres hete?
  Ye that it use, I rede ye it lete,
  Lest ye lese al; for bet than never is late.                1410
  Never to thryve were to long a date.
  Though ye prolle ay, ye shul it never finde;
  Ye been as bolde as is Bayard the blinde,                  (860)
  That blundreth forth, and peril casteth noon;
  He is as bold to renne agayn a stoon                        1415
  As for to goon besydes in the weye.
  So faren ye that multiplye, I seye.
  If that your yën can nat seen aright,
  Loke that your minde lakke nought his sight.
  For, though ye loke never so brode, and stare,              1420
  Ye shul nat winne a myte on that chaffare,
  But wasten al that ye may rape and renne.
  Withdrawe the fyr, lest it to faste brenne;                (870)
  Medleth na-more with that art, I mene,
  For, if ye doon, your thrift is goon ful clene.             1425

  As his Rosarie maketh mencioun;
  He seith right thus, with-outen any lye,                    1430
  'Ther may no man Mercurie mortifye,
  But it be with his brother knowleching.
  How that he, which that first seyde this thing,            (880)
  Of philosophres fader was, Hermes;
  He seith, how that the dragoun, doutelees,                  1435
  Ne deyeth nat, but-if that he be slayn
  With his brother; and that is for to sayn,
  By the dragoun, Mercurie and noon other
  He understood; and brimstoon by his brother,
  [553: T. 16908-16942.]
  That out of _sol_ and _luna_ were y-drawe.                  1440
  And therfor,' seyde he, 'tak heed to my sawe,
  Let no man bisy him this art for to seche,
  But-if that he thentencioun and speche                     (890)
  Of philosophres understonde can;
  And if he do, he is a lewed man.                            1445

  And this was his demande in soothfastnesse:
  'Tel me the name of the privy stoon?'

    And Plato answerde unto him anoon,                       (900)
  'Tak the stoon that Titanos men name.'

    'Which is that?' quod he. 'Magnesia is the same,'         1455

  The philosophres sworn were everichoon,
  That they sholden discovere it un-to noon,                  1465
  Ne in no book it wryte in no manere;
  For un-to Crist it is so leef and dere
  That he wol nat that it discovered be,
  But wher it lyketh to his deitee
  Man for tenspyre, and eek for to defende                    1470

  [554: T. 16943-9.]
  I rede, as for the beste, lete it goon.                     1475
  For who-so maketh god his adversarie,
  As for to werken any thing in contrarie
  Of his wil, certes, never shal he thryve,
  Thogh that he multiplye terme of his lyve.
  And ther a poynt; for ended is my tale;                     1480

  Wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel toun
  Which that y-cleped is Bob-up-and-doun,
  Under the Blee, in Caunterbury weye?
  Ther gan our hoste for to Iape and pleye,
  And seyde, 'sirs, what! Dun is in the myre!
  Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre,
  That wol awake our felawe heer bihinde?
  A theef mighte him ful lightly robbe and binde.
  See how he nappeth! see, for cokkes bones,
  As he wol falle from his hors at ones.
  Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce?
  Do him come forth, he knoweth his penaunce,
  For he shal telle a tale, by my fey!
  Al-though it be nat worth a botel hey.
  Awake, thou cook,' quod he, 'god yeve thee sorwe,
  What eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe?
  Hastow had fleen al night, or artow dronke,
  Or hastow with som quene al night y-swonke,
  So that thou mayst nat holden up thyn heed?'

    This cook, that was ful pale and no-thing reed,             20
  Seyde to our host, 'so god my soule blesse,
  As ther is falle on me swich hevinesse,
  Noot I nat why, that me were lever slepe
  Than the beste galoun wyn in Chepe.'

    'Wel,' quod the maunciple, 'if it may doon ese              25
  To thee, sir cook, and to no wight displese
  Which that heer rydeth in this companye,
  And that our host wol, of his curteisye,
  I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale;
  For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale,                   30
  Thyn yën daswen eek, as that me thinketh,
  And wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure stinketh,
  That sheweth wel thou art not wel disposed;
  Of me, certein, thou shalt nat been y-glosed.
  Se how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight,                     35
  As though he wolde us swolwe anon-right.
  Hold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kin!
  The devel of helle sette his foot ther-in!
  Thy cursed breeth infecte wol us alle;
  Fy, stinking swyn, fy! foule moot thee falle!                 40
  A! taketh heed, sirs, of this lusty man.
  Now, swete sir, wol ye Iusten atte fan?
  Ther-to me thinketh ye been wel y-shape!
  I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,
  And that is whan men pleyen with a straw.'                    45
  And with this speche the cook wex wrooth and wraw,
  And on the maunciple he gan nodde faste
  For lakke of speche, and doun the hors him caste,
  Wher as he lay, til that men up him took;
  This was a fayr chivachee of a cook!                          50
  Allas! he nadde holde him by his ladel!
  And, er that he agayn were in his sadel,
  Ther was greet showving bothe to and fro,
  To lifte him up, and muchel care and wo,
  [557: T. 17004-17038.]
  So unweldy was this sory palled gost.                         55
  And to the maunciple thanne spak our host,
  'By-cause drink hath dominacioun
  Upon this man, by my savacioun
  I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.
  For, were it wyn, or old or moysty ale,                       60
  That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,
  And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.
  He hath also to do more than y-nough
  To kepe him and his capel out of slough;
  And, if he falle from his capel eft-sone,                     65
  Than shul we alle have y-nough to done,
  In lifting up his hevy dronken cors.
  Telle on thy tale, of him make I no fors.

    But yet, maunciple, in feith thou art to nyce,
  Thus openly repreve him of his vyce.                          70
  Another day he wol, peraventure,
  Reclayme thee, and bringe thee to lure;
  I mene, he speke wol of smale thinges,
  As for to pinchen at thy rekeninges,
  That wer not honeste, if it cam to preef.'                    75

    'No,' quod the maunciple, 'that were a greet mescheef!
  So mighte he lightly bringe me in the snare.
  Yet hadde I lever payen for the mare
  Which he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve;
  I wol nat wratthe him, al-so mote I thryve!                   80
  That that I spak, I seyde it in my bourde;
  And wite ye what? I have heer, in a gourde,
  A draught of wyn, ye, of a rype grape,
  And right anon ye shul seen a good Iape.
  This cook shal drinke ther-of, if I may;                      85

    And certeinly, to tellen as it was,
  Of this vessel the cook drank faste, allas!
  What neded him? he drank y-nough biforn.
  [558: T. 17039-17053.]
  And whan he hadde pouped in this horn,                        90
  To the maunciple he took the gourde agayn;
  And of that drinke the cook was wonder fayn,
  And thanked him in swich wyse as he coude.

    89. So E.; Cm. nedith hym; Hn. Hl. neded it; _rest_ needeth it.   90.

    Than gan our host to laughen wonder loude,
  And seyde, 'I see wel, it is necessarie,                      95
  Wher that we goon, good drink we with us carie;

  HERE BIGINNETH THE MAUNCIPLES TALE OF THE CROWE.

  Whan Phebus dwelled here in this erthe adoun,                105
  As olde bokes maken mencioun,
  He was the moste lusty bachiler
  In al this world, and eek the beste archer;
  He slow Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay
  Slepinge agayn the sonne upon a day;                         110
  And many another noble worthy dede
  He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.

    105. E. world; _rest_ erthe.   108. Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. Of (_for In_).

    Pleyen he coude on every minstralcye,
  And singen, that it was a melodye,                          (10)
  To heren of his clere vois the soun.                         115
  Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
  That with his singing walled that citee,
  Coude never singen half so wel as he.
  Therto he was the semelieste man
  That is or was, sith that the world bigan.                   120
  What nedeth it his fetures to discryve?
  For in this world was noon so fair on lyve.
  He was ther-with fulfild of gentillesse,
  Of honour, and of parfit worthinesse.                       (20)

    This Phebus, that was flour of bachelrye,                  125
  As wel in fredom as in chivalrye,
  For his desport, in signe eek of victorie
  Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,
  Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.

    125. Hn. Cp. bachelrye; E. Bachilrie.

    Now had this Phebus in his hous a crowe,                   130
  [560: T. 17080-17114.]
  Which in a cage he fostred many a day,
  And taughte it speken, as men teche a Iay.
  Whyt was this crowe, as is a snow-whyt swan,
  And countrefete the speche of every man                     (30)
  He coude, whan he sholde telle a tale.                       135
  Ther-with in al this world no nightingale
  Ne coude, by an hondred thousand deel,
  Singen so wonder merily and weel.

    130. E. hadde.   132. Hl. speken; _rest_ speke.   133. E. _om._ is.
    138. E. Hn. myrily.

    Now had this Phebus in his hous a wyf,
  Which that he lovede more than his lyf,                      140
  And night and day dide ever his diligence
  Hir for to plese, and doon hir reverence,
  Save only, if the sothe that I shal sayn,
  Ialous he was, and wolde have hept hir fayn;                (40)
  For him were looth by-iaped for to be.                       145
  And so is every wight in swich degree;
  But al in ydel, for it availleth noght.
  A good wyf, that is clene of werk and thoght,
  Sholde nat been kept in noon await, certayn;
  And trewely, the labour is in vayn                           150
  To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat be.
  This holde I for a verray nycetee,
  To spille labour, for to kepe wyves;
  Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.                      (50)

    139. E. hadde.   143. E. Cm. _om._ if; Hn. that.   that] Hn. if.   147.
    E. Cm. in ydel; _rest_ for naught.

    But now to purpos, as I first bigan:                       155
  This worthy Phebus dooth all that he can
  To plesen hir, weninge by swich plesaunce,
  And for his manhede and his governaunce,
  That no man sholde han put him from hir grace.
  But god it woot, ther may no man embrace                     160
  As to destreyne a thing, which that nature
  Hath naturelly set in a creature.

    157. E. Cm. that; Hn. for; _rest_ by (be).   162. E. natureelly.

    Tak any brid, and put it in a cage,
  And do al thyn entente and thy corage                       (60)
  To fostre it tendrely with mete and drinke,                  165
  [561: T. 17115-17149.]
  Of alle deyntees that thou canst bithinke,
  And keep it al-so clenly as thou may;
  Al-though his cage of gold be never so gay,
  Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand fold,
  Lever in a forest, that is rude and cold,                    170
  Gon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.
  For ever this brid wol doon his bisinesse
  To escape out of his cage, if he may;
  His libertee this brid desireth ay.                         (70)

    163. E. Taak.   170. Cp. Pt. Ln. wilde (_for_ rude); Hl. wyd.   173.
    Cp. when; Ln. Hl. whan; _rest_ if.   174. E. Hn. Cm. this; _rest_ the.

    Lat take a cat, and fostre him wel with milk,              175
  And tendre flesh, and make his couche of silk,
  And lat him seen a mous go by the wal;
  Anon he weyveth milk, and flesh, and al,
  And every deyntee that is in that hous,
  Swich appetyt hath he to ete a mous.                         180
  Lo, here hath lust his dominacioun,
  And appetyt flemeth discrecioun.

    180. E. he hath; Cp. hath sche; _rest_ hath he.

    A she-wolf hath also a vileins kinde;
  The lewedeste wolf that she may finde,                      (80)
  Or leest of reputacion wol she take,                         185
  In tyme whan hir lust to han a make.

    185. Hl. _ins._ him, _and the rest_ that, _before_ wol (_badly_).

    Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men
  That been untrewe, and no-thing by wommen.
  For men han ever a likerous appetyt
  On lower thing to parfourne hir delyt                        190
  Than on hir wyves, be they never so faire,
  Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire.
  Flesh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,
  That we ne conne in no-thing han plesaunce                  (90)
  That souneth in-to vertu any whyle.                          195

    195. Hl. Cm. souneth; _rest_ sowneth.

    This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gyle,
  Deceyved was, for al his Iolitee;
  For under him another hadde she,
  A man of litel reputacioun,
  Noght worth to Phebus in comparisoun.                        200
  [562: T. 17150-17184.]
  The more harm is; it happeth ofte so,
  Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo.

    200. Cp. Hl. Nought; E. Hn. Nat; _rest_ Not; _see_ l. 254.

    And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent,
  His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent,                     (100)
  Hir lemman? certes, this is a knavish speche!                205
  Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche.

    The wyse Plato seith, as ye may rede,
  The word mot nede accorde with the dede.
  If men shal telle proprely a thing,
  The word mot cosin be to the werking.                        210
  I am a boistous man, right thus seye I,
  Ther nis no difference, trewely,
  Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree,
  If of hir body dishonest she be,                           (110)
  And a povre wenche, other than this--                        215
  If it so be, they werke bothe amis--
  But that the gentile, in estaat above,
  She shal be cleped his lady, as in love;
  And for that other is a povre womman,
  She shal be cleped his wenche, or his lemman.                220
  And, god it wool, myn owene dere brother,
  Men leyn that oon as lowe as lyth that other.

    214. E. Cp. dishoneste; Hn. deshoneste.   215. _For_ a, Tyrwhitt
    _reads_ any.   217. E. Cm. hir estaat (stat); _rest om._ hir.

    Right so, bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt
  And an outlawe, or a theef erraunt,                        (120)
  The same I seye, ther is no difference.                      225
  To Alisaundre told was this sentence;
  That, for the tyrant is of gretter might,
  By force of meynee for to sleen doun-right,
  And brennen hous and hoom, and make al plain,
  Lo! therfor is he cleped a capitain;                         230
  And, for the outlawe hath but smal meynee,
  And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,
  Ne bringe a contree to so greet mescheef,
  Men clepen him an outlawe or a theef.                      (130)
  But, for I am a man noght textuel,                           235
  [563: T. 17185-17219.]
  I wol noght telle of textes never a del;
  I wol go to my tale, as I bigan.
  Whan Phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman,
  Anon they wroghten al hir lust volage.

    223. In Hn., titlelees _is glossed by_ sine titulo.   226. Hl. told
    was; _rest_ was told.   235, 236. E. textueel, deel.

    The whyte crowe, that heng ay in the cage,                 240
  Biheld hir werk, and seyde never a word.
  And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the lord,
  This crowe sang 'cokkow! cokkow! cokkow!'

    240. E. they (_for_ that).   E. heeng; Ln. honge; _rest_ heng.   241.

    'What, brid?' quod Phebus, 'what song singestow?         (140)
  Ne were thow wont so merily to singe                         245
  That to myn herte it was a reioisinge
  To here thy vois? allas! what song is this?'

    245. E. Hn. myrily.

    'By god,' quod he, 'I singe nat amis;
  Phebus,' quod he, 'for al thy worthinesse,
  For al thy beautee and thy gentilesse,                       250
  For al thy song and al thy minstralcye,
  For al thy waiting, blered is thyn yë
  With oon of litel reputacioun,
  Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun,                    (150)
  The mountance of a gnat; so mote I thryve!                   255
  For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh him swyve.'

    What wol ye more? the crowe anon him tolde,
  By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde,
  How that his wyf had doon hir lecherye,
  Him to gret shame and to gret vileinye;                      260
  And tolde him ofte, he saugh it with his yën.
  This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen,
  Him thoughte his sorweful herte brast a-two;
  His bowe he bente, and sette ther-inne a flo,              (160)
  And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.                 265
  This is theffect, ther is na-more to sayn;
  For sorwe of which he brak his minstralcye,
  Bothe harpe, and lute, and giterne, and sautrye;
  And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe.
  And after that, thus spak he to the crowe:                   270

    'Traitour,' quod he, 'with tonge of scorpioun,
  Thou hast me broght to my confusioun!
  Allas! that I was wroght! why nere I deed?
  O dere wyf, o gemme of lustiheed,                          (170)
  That were to me so sad and eek so trewe,                     275

  O trouble wit, o ire recchelees,

  O wantrust, ful of fals suspecioun,
  Where was thy wit and thy discrecioun?
  O every man, be-war of rakelnesse,
  Ne trowe no-thing with-outen strong witnesse;              (180)
  Smyt nat to sone, er that ye witen why,                      285
  And beeth avysed wel and sobrely
  Er ye doon any execucioun,

  Allas! a thousand folk hath rakel ire

    And to the crowe, 'o false theef!' seyde he,
  'I wol thee quyte anon thy false tale!
  Thou songe whylom lyk a nightingale;                       (190)
  Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon,                   295
  And eek thy whyte fetheres everichon,
  Ne never in al thy lyf ne shaltou speke.
  Thus shal men on a traitour been awreke;
  Thou and thyn of-spring ever shul be blake,
  Ne never swete noise shul ye make,                           300
  But ever crye agayn tempest and rayn,
  In tokeninge that thurgh thee my wyf is slayn.'
  And to the crowe he stirte, and that anon,
  And pulled his whyte fetheres everichon,                   (200)
  And made him blak, and refte him al his song,                305
  [565: T. 17255-17289.]
  And eek his speche, and out at dore him slong

  Ne telleth never no man in your lyf
  How that another man hath dight his wyf;
  He wol yow haten mortally, certeyn.
  Daun Salomon, as wyse clerkes seyn,                        (210)
  Techeth a man to kepe his tonge wel;                         315
  But as I seyde, I am noght textuel.
  But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame:
  'My sone, thenk on the crowe, a goddes name;
  My sone, keep wel thy tonge and keep thy freend.
  A wikked tonge is worse than a feend.                        320
  My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse;
  My sone, god of his endelees goodnesse
  Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke,
  For man sholde him avyse what he speke.                    (220)
  My sone, ful ofte, for to muche speche,                      325
  Hath many a man ben spilt, as clerkes teche;
  But for a litel speche avysely
  Is no men shent, to speke generally.
  My sone, thy tonge sholdestow restreyne
  At alle tyme, but whan thou doost thy peyne                  330
  To speke of god, in honour and preyere.
  The firste vertu, sone, if thou wolt lere,
  Is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge.--
  Thus lerne children whan that they ben yonge.--            (230)
  My sone, of muchel speking yvel-avysed,                      335
  Ther lasse speking hadde y-nough suffysed,
  Comth muchel harm, thus was me told and taught.
  In muchel speche sinne wanteth naught.
  Wostow wher-of a rakel tonge serveth?
  Right as a swerd forcutteth and forkerveth                   340
  [566: T. 17290-17311.]
  An arm a-two, my dere sone, right so
  A tonge cutteth frendship al a-two.
  A Iangler is to god abhominable;
  Reed Salomon, so wys and honurable;                        (240)
  Reed David in his psalmes, reed Senekke.                     345
  My sone, spek nat, but with thyn heed thou bekke.
  Dissimule as thou were deef, if that thou here
  A Iangler speke of perilous matere.
  The Fleming seith, and lerne it, if thee leste,
  That litel Iangling causeth muchel reste.                    350
  My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seyd,
  Thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd;
  But he that hath misseyd, I dar wel sayn,
  He may by no wey clepe his word agayn.                     (250)
  Thing that is seyd, is seyd; and forth it gooth,             355
  Though him repente, or be him leef or looth.
  He is his thral to whom that he hath sayd
  A tale, of which he is now yvel apayd.
  My sone, be war, and be non auctour newe
  Of tydinges, whether they ben false or trewe.                360
  Wher-so thou come, amonges hye or lowe,
  Kepe wel thy tonge, and thenk up-on the crowe.

  By that the maunciple hadde his tale al ended,
  The sonne fro the south lyne was descended
  So lowe, that he nas nat, to my sighte,
  Degreës nyne and twenty as in highte.
  Foure of the clokke it was tho, as I gesse;                    5
  For eleven foot, or litel more or lesse,
  My shadwe was at thilke tyme, as there,
  Of swich feet as my lengthe parted were
  In six feet equal of proporcioun.
  Ther-with the mones exaltacioun,                              10

  I prey to god, so yeve him right good chaunce,                20
  That telleth this tale to us lustily.

§ 1. Our swete lord god of hevene, that no man wole perisse, but wole that
we comen alle to the knoweleche of him, and to the blisful lyf that is
perdurable, /75 amonesteth us by the prophete Ieremie, that seith in this
wyse: / 'stondeth upon the weyes, and seeth and axeth of olde pathes (that
is to seyn, of olde sentences) which is the goode wey; / and walketh in
that wey, and ye shul finde refresshinge for your soules,' &c. / Manye been
the weyes espirituels that leden folk to oure Lord Iesu Crist, and to the
regne of glorie. / Of whiche weyes, ther is a ful noble wey and a ful
covenable, which may nat faile to man ne to womman, that thurgh sinne hath
misgoon fro the righte wey of Ierusalem celestial; /80 and this wey is
cleped Penitence, of which man sholde gladly herknen and enquere with al
his herte; / to witen what is Penitence, and whennes it is cleped
Penitence, and in how manye maneres been the accions or werkinges of
Penitence, / and how manye spyces ther been of Penitence, and whiche
thinges apertenen and bihoven to Penitence, and whiche thinges destourben
Penitence. /

§ 2. Seint Ambrose seith, that 'Penitence is the pleyninge of man for the
gilt that he hath doon, and na-more to do any thing for which him oghte to
pleyne.' / And som doctour seith: 'Penitence is the waymentinge of man,
that sorweth for his sinne [571] and pyneth him-self for he hath misdoon.'
/85 Penitence, with certeyne circumstances, is verray repentance of a man
that halt him-self in sorwe and other peyne for hise giltes. / And for he
shal be verray penitent, he shal first biwailen the sinnes that he hath
doon, and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have shrift of mouthe, and
to doon satisfaccioun, / and never to doon thing for which him oghte more
to biwayle or to compleyne, and to continue in goode werkes: or elles his
repentance may nat availle. / For as seith seint Isidre: 'he is a Iaper and
a gabber, and no verray repentant, that eftsoone dooth thing, for which him
oghte repente.' / Wepinge, and nat for to stinte to doon sinne, may nat
avaylle. /90 But nathelees, men shal hope that every tyme that man falleth,
be it never so ofte, that he may arise thurgh Penitence, if he have grace:
but certeinly it is greet doute. / For as seith Seint Gregorie: 'unnethe
aryseth he out of sinne, that is charged with the charge of yvel usage.' /
And therfore repentant folk, that stinte for to sinne, and forlete sinne er
that sinne forlete hem, holy chirche holdeth hem siker of hir savacioun. /
And he that sinneth, and verraily repenteth him in his laste ende, holy
chirche yet hopeth his savacioun, by the grete mercy of oure lord Iesu
Crist, for his repentaunce; but tak the siker wey. /

§ 3. And now, sith I have declared yow what thing is Penitence, now shul ye
understonde that ther been three accions of Penitence. /95 The firste
accion of Penitence is, that a man be baptized after that he hath sinned. /
Seint Augustin seith: 'but he be penitent for his olde sinful lyf, he may
nat biginne the newe clene lif.' / For certes, if he be baptized withouten
penitence of his olde gilt, he receiveth the mark of baptisme, but nat the
grace ne the remission of his sinnes, til he have repentance verray. /
Another defaute is this, that men doon deedly sinne after that they han
received baptisme. / The thridde defaute is, that men fallen in venial
sinnes after hir baptisme, fro day to day. /100 Ther-of seith Seint
Augustin, that 'penitence of goode and humble folk is the penitence of
every day.' /

    96. _All but_ E. _om._ accion of Penitence.   97. Hl. but if.   98-100.
    E. Hn. baptesme.   100. Hl. in-to venial synne.

[572] § 4. The spyces of Penitence been three. That oon of hem is solempne,
another is commune, and the thridde is privee. / Thilke penance that is
solempne, is in two maneres; as to be put out of holy chirche in lente, for
slaughtre of children, and swich maner thing. / Another is, whan a man hath
sinned openly, of which sinne the fame is openly spoken in the contree; and
thanne holy chirche by Iugement destreineth him for to do open penaunce. /
Commune penaunce is that preestes enioinen men comunly in certeyn caas; as
for to goon, peraventure, naked in pilgrimages, or bare-foot. /105 Privee
penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee sinnes, of whiche we
shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce. /

    Hl. streyneth.   105. E. Cm. _om._ comunly.   106. E. they shryue hem.

§ 5. Now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray
parfit Penitence. And this stant on three thinges; / Contricioun of herte,
Confessioun of Mouth, and Satisfaccioun. / For which seith Seint Iohn
Crisostom: 'Penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benignely every peyne
that him is enioyned, with contricion of herte, and shrift of mouth, with
satisfaccion; and in werkinge of alle maner humilitee.' / And this is
fruitful Penitence agayn three thinges in whiche we wratthe oure lord Iesu
Crist: /110 this is to seyn, by delyt in thinkinge, by recchelesnesse in
spekinge, and by wikked sinful werkinge. / And agayns thise wikkede giltes
is Penitence, that may be lykned un-to a tree. /

    stondith.   109. Hl. humblete.   112. Hl. these thre wickid.

§ 6. The rote of this tree is Contricion, that hydeth him in the herte of
him that is verray repentant, right as the rote of a tree hydeth him in the
erthe. / Of the rote of Contricion springeth a stalke, that bereth
braunches and leves of Confession, and fruit of Satisfaccion. / For which
Crist seith in his gospel: 'dooth digne fruit of Penitence'; for by this
fruit may men knowe this tree, and nat by the rote that is hid in the herte
of man, ne by the braunches ne by the leves of Confession. /115 And
therefore oure Lord Iesu Crist seith thus: 'by the fruit of hem ye shul
knowen hem.' / Of this rote eek springeth a seed of grace, the which seed
is moder of sikernesse, and this seed is egre and [573] hoot. / The grace
of this seed springeth of god, thurgh remembrance of the day of dome and on
the peynes of helle. / Of this matere seith Salomon, that 'in the drede of
god man forleteth his sinne.' / The hete of this seed is the love of god,
and the desiring of the Ioye perdurable. /120 This hete draweth the herte
of a man to god, and dooth him haten his sinne. / For soothly, ther is
no-thing that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice, ne
no-thing is to him more abhominable than thilke milk whan it is medled with
other mete. / Right so the sinful man that loveth his sinne, him semeth
that it is to him most swete of any-thing; / but fro that tyme that he
loveth sadly our lord Iesu Crist, and desireth the lif perdurable, ther nis
to him no-thing more abhominable. / For soothly, the lawe of god is the
love of god; for which David the prophete seith: 'I have loved thy lawe and
hated wikkednesse and hate'; he that loveth god kepeth his lawe and his
word. /125 This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit, up-on the avision
of the king Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled him to do penitence. /
Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receiven, and he that holdeth
him in verray penitence is blessed; after the sentence of Salomon. /

§ 7. In this Penitence or Contricion man shal understonde foure thinges,
that is to seyn, what is Contricion: and whiche been the causes that moeven
a man to Contricion: and how he sholde be contrit: and what Contricion
availleth to the soule. / Thanne is it thus: that Contricion is the verray
sorwe that a man receiveth in his herte for his sinnes, with sad purpos to
shryve him, and to do penaunce, and nevermore to do sinne. / And this sorwe
shal been in this manere, as seith seint Bernard: 'it shal been hevy and
grevous, and ful sharpe and poinant in herte.' /130 First, for man hath
agilt his lord and his creatour; and more sharpe and poinant, for he hath
agilt his fader celestial; / and yet more sharpe and poinant, for he hath
wrathed and agilt him that boghte him; which with his precious blood hath
delivered us fro the bondes of sinne, and fro the crueltee of the devel and
fro the peynes of helle. /

    131. Cp. agult; Hl. agiltid.

§ 8. The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricion been six. First, a man
shal remembre him of hise sinnes; / but loke [574] he that thilke
remembrance ne be to him no delyt by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for
his gilt. For Iob seith: 'sinful men doon werkes worthy of Confession.' /
And therfore seith Ezechie: 'I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf, in
bitternesse of myn herte.' /135 And god seith in the Apocalips: remembreth
yow fro whennes that ye been falle'; for biforn that tyme that ye sinned,
ye were the children of god, and limes of the regne of god; / but for your
sinne ye been woxen thral and foul, and membres of the feend, hate of
aungels, sclaundre of holy chirche, and fode of the false serpent;
perpetuel matere of the fyr of helle. / And yet more foul and abhominable,
for ye trespassen so ofte tyme, as doth the hound that retourneth to eten
his spewing. / And yet be ye fouler for your longe continuing in sinne and
your sinful usage, for which ye be roten in your sinne, as a beest in his
dong. / Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his sinne,
and no delyt, as god seith by the prophete Ezechiel: /140 'ye shal remembre
yow of youre weyes, and they shuln displese yow.' Sothly, sinnes been the
weyes that leden folk to helle. /

    134. E. looke he; _rest om._ he.   135. Hl. Ln. Ezechiel.   137. E.
    p_er_petueel.

§ 9. The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of sinne is
this: that, as seith seint Peter, 'who-so that doth sinne is thral of
sinne'; and sinne put a man in greet thraldom. / And therfore seith the
prophete Ezechiel: 'I wente sorweful in desdayn of my-self.' And certes,
wel oghte a man have desdayn of sinne, and withdrawe him from that thraldom
and vileinye. / And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere. He seith thus:
'though I wiste that neither god ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it, yet
wolde I have desdayn for to do sinne.' / And the same Seneca also seith: 'I
am born to gretter thinges than to be thral to my body, or than for to
maken of my body a thral.' /145 Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman
maken of his body, than for to yeven his body to sinne. / Al were it the
fouleste cherl, or the fouleste womman that liveth, and leest of value, yet
is he thanne more foule and more in servitute. / Evere fro the hyer degree
that man falleth, the more is he thral, and more to god and to the world
vile and abhominable. / O gode god, wel oghte [575] man have desdayn of
sinne; sith that, thurgh sinne, ther he was free, now is he maked bonde. /
And therfore seyth Seint Augustin: 'if thou hast desdayn of thy servant, if
he agilte or sinne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thy-self sholdest do
sinne.' /150 Take reward of thy value, that thou ne be to foul to thy-self.
/ Allas! wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles
to sinne, and sore been ashamed of hem-self, / that god of his endelees
goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of
body, hele, beautee, prosperitee, / and boghte hem fro the deeth with his
herte blood, that they so unkindely, agayns his gentilesse, quyten him so
vileinsly, to slaughtre of hir owene soules. / O gode god, ye wommen that
been of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon, that
seith: /155 'he lykneth a fair womman, that is a fool of hir body, lyk to a
ring of gold that were in the groyn of a sowe.' / For right as a sowe
wroteth in everich ordure, so wroteth she hir beautee in the stinkinge
ordure of sinne. /

§ 10. The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to Contricion, is drede of
the day of dome, and of the horrible peynes of helle. / For as seint Ierome
seith: 'at every tyme that me remembreth of the day of dome, I quake; / for
whan I ete or drinke, or what-so that I do, evere semeth me that the trompe
sowneth in myn ere: /160 riseth up, ye that been dede, and cometh to the
Iugement.' / O gode god, muchel oghte a man to drede swich a Iugement,
'ther-as we shullen been alle,' as seint Poul seith, 'biforn the sete of
oure lord Iesu Crist'; / wher-as he shal make a general congregacion,
wher-as no man may been absent. / For certes, there availleth noon essoyne
ne excusacion. / And nat only that oure defautes shullen be iuged, but eek
that alle oure werkes shullen openly be knowe. /165 And as seith Seint
Bernard: 'ther ne shal no pledinge availle, ne no sleighte; we shullen
yeven rekeninge of everich ydel word.' / Ther shul we han a Iuge that may
nat been deceived ne corrupt. And why? For, certes, alle our thoghtes been
discovered as to him; ne for preyere ne for mede he shal nat been corrupt.
/ And therfore [576] seith Salomon: 'the wratthe of god ne wol nat spare no
wight, for preyere ne for yifte'; and therfore, at the day of doom, ther
nis noon hope to escape. / Wherfore, as seith Seint Anselm: 'ful greet
angwissh shul the sinful folk have at that tyme; / ther shal the sterne and
wrothe Iuge sitte above, and under him the horrible put of helle open to
destroyen him that moot biknowen hise sinnes, whiche sinnes openly been
shewed biforn god and biforn every creature. /170 And on the left syde, mo
develes than herte may bithinke, for to harie and drawe the sinful soules
to the pyne of helle. / And with-inne the hertes of folk shal be the
bytinge conscience, and with-oute-forth shal be the world al brenninge. /
Whider shal thanne the wrecched sinful man flee to hyden him? Certes, he
may nat hyden him; he moste come forth and shewen him.' / For certes, as
seith seint Ierome: 'the erthe shal casten him out of him, and the see
also; and the eyr also, that shal be ful of thonder-clappes and
lightninges.' / Now sothly, who-so wel remembreth him of thise thinges, I
gesse that his sinne shal nat turne him in-to delyt, but to greet sorwe,
for drede of the peyne of helle. /175 And therfore seith Iob to god:
'suffre, lord, that I may a whyle biwaille and wepe, er I go with-oute
returning to the derke lond, covered with the derknesse of deeth; / to the
lond of misese and of derknesse, where-as is the shadwe of deeth; where-as
ther is noon ordre or ordinance, but grisly drede that evere shal laste.' /
Lo, here may ye seen that Iob preyde respyt a whyle, to biwepe and waille
his trespas; for soothly oon day of respyt is bettre than al the tresor of
the world. / And for-as-muche as a man may acquiten him-self biforn god by
penitence in this world, and nat by tresor, therfore sholde he preye to god
to yeve him respyt a whyle, to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas. / For
certes, al the sorwe that a man mighte make fro the beginning of the world,
nis but a litel thing at regard of the sorwe of helle. /180 The cause why
that Iob clepeth helle 'the lond of derknesse'; / under-stondeth that he
clepeth it 'londe' or erthe, for it is stable, and nevere shal faille;
'derk,' for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material. / For
certes, [577] the derke light, that shal come out of the fyr that evere
shal brenne, shal turne him al to peyne that is in helle; for it sheweth
him to the horrible develes that him tormenten. / 'Covered with the
derknesse of deeth': that is to seyn, that he that is in helle shal have
defaute of the sighte of god; for certes, the sighte of god is the lyf
perdurable. / 'The derknesse of deeth' been the sinnes that the wrecched
man hath doon, whiche that destourben him to see the face of god; right as
doth a derk cloude bitwixe us and the sonne. /185 'Lond of misese':
by-cause that ther been three maneres of defautes, agayn three thinges that
folk of this world han in this present lyf, that is to seyn, honours,
delyces, and richesses. / Agayns honour, have they in helle shame and
confusion. / For wel ye woot that men clepen 'honour' the reverence that
man doth to man; but in helle is noon honour ne reverence. For certes,
na-more reverence shal be doon there to a king than to a knave. / For which
god seith by the prophete Ieremye: 'thilke folk that me despysen shul been
in despyt.' / 'Honour' is eek cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no man
serven other but of harm and torment. 'Honour' is eek cleped greet dignitee
and heighnesse; but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes. /190
And god seith: 'the horrible develes shulle goon and comen up-on the
hevedes of the dampned folk.' And this is for-as-muche as, the hyer that
they were in this present lyf, the more shulle they been abated and
defouled in helle. / Agayns the richesses of this world, shul they han
misese of poverte; and this poverte shal been in foure thinges: / in
defaute of tresor, of which that David seith; 'the riche folk, that
embraceden and oneden al hir herte to tresor of this world, shul slepe in
the slepinge of deeth; and no-thing ne shul they finden in hir handes of al
hir tresor.' / And more-over, the miseise of helle shal been in defaute of
mete and drinke. / For god seith thus by Moyses; 'they shul been wasted
with hunger, and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth,
and the galle of the dragon shal been hir drinke, and the venim of the
dragon hir morsels.' /195 And forther-over, hir miseise shal been in
defaute of clothing: for they shulle be naked in body as of clothing, save
the fyr in which they brenne and othere filthes; / and naked shul they been
of [578] soule, of alle manere vertues, which that is the clothing of the
soule. Where been thanne the gaye robes and the softe shetes and the smale
shertes? / Lo, what seith god of hem by the prophete Isaye: 'that under hem
shul been strawed motthes, and hir covertures shulle been of wormes of
helle.' / And forther-over, hir miseise shal been in defaute of freendes;
for he nis nat povre that hath goode freendes, but there is no freend; /
for neither god ne no creature shal been freend to hem, and everich of hem
shal haten other with deedly hate. /200 'The sones and the doghtren shullen
rebellen agayns fader and mooder, and kinrede agayns kinrede, and chyden
and despysen everich of hem other,' bothe day and night, as god seith by
the prophete Michias. / And the lovinge children, that whylom loveden so
fleshly everich other, wolden everich of hem eten other if they mighte. /
For how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle, whan they
hated ech of hem other in the prosperitee of this lyf? / For truste wel,
hir fleshly love was deedly hate; as seith the prophete David: 'who-so that
loveth wikkednesse he hateth his soule.' / And who-so hateth his owene
soule, certes, he may love noon other wight in no manere. /205 And
therefore, in helle is no solas ne no frendshipe, but evere the more
fleshly kinredes that been in helle, the more cursinges, the more
chydinges, and the more deedly hate ther is among hem. / And forther-over,
they shul have defaute of alle manere delyces; for certes, delyces been
after the appetytes of the fyve wittes, as sighte, heringe, smellinge,
savoringe, and touchinge. / But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of
derknesse and of smoke, and therfore ful of teres; and hir heringe, ful of
waymentinge and of grintinge of teeth, as seith Iesu Crist; / hir
nosethirles shullen be ful of stinkinge stink. And as seith Isaye the
prophete: 'hir savoring shal be ful of bitter galle.' / And touchinge of al
hir body, y-covered with 'fyr that nevere shal quenche, and with wormes
that nevere shul dyen,' as god seith by the mouth of Isaye. /210 And
for-as-muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne, and by hir
deeth flee fro peyne, that may they understonden by the word of Iob, that
seith: 'ther-as is the [579] shadwe of deeth.' / Certes, a shadwe hath the
lyknesse of the thing of which it is shadwe, but shadwe is nat the same
thing of which it is shadwe. / Right so fareth the peyne of helle; it is
lyk deeth for the horrible anguissh, and why? For it peyneth hem evere, as
though they sholde dye anon; but certes they shal nat dye. / For as seith
Seint Gregorie: 'to wrecche caytives shal be deeth with-oute deeth, and
ende with-outen ende, and defaute with-oute failinge. / For hir deeth shal
alwey liven, and hir ende shal everemo biginne, and hir defaute shal nat
faille.' /215 And therfore seith Seint Iohn the Evangelist: 'they shullen
folwe deeth, and they shul nat finde him; and they shul desyren to dye, and
deeth shal flee fro hem.' / And eek Iob seith: that 'in helle is noon ordre
of rule.' / And al-be-it so that god hath creat alle thinges in right
ordre, and no-thing with-outen ordre, but alle thinges been ordeyned and
nombred; yet nathelees they that been dampned been no-thing in ordre, ne
holden noon ordre. / For the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruit. / For, as the
prophete David seith: 'god shal destroie the fruit of the erthe as fro
hem;' ne water ne shal yeve hem no moisture; ne the eyr no refresshing, ne
fyr no light. /220 For as seith seint Basilie: 'the brenninge of the fyr of
this world shal god yeven in helle to hem that been dampned; / but the
light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to hise children'; right
as the gode man yeveth flesh to hise children, and bones to his houndes. /
And for they shullen have noon hope to escape, seith seint Iob atte laste:
that 'ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen with-outen ende.' /
Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come, and this drede shal evere
dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned. And therefore han they lorn
al hir hope, for sevene causes. / First, for god that is hir Iuge shal be
with-outen mercy to hem; ne they may nat plese him, ne noon of hise halwes;
ne they ne may yeve no-thing for hir raunson; /225 ne they have no vois to
speke to him; ne they may nat flee fro peyne; ne they have no goodnesse in
hem, that they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne. / And therfore seith
Salomon: 'the wikked man dyeth; and whan he is deed, he shal have noon hope
to escape fro peyne.' / Who-so thanne wolde wel understande these peynes,
[580] and bithinke him weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his
sinnes, certes, he sholde have more talent to syken and to wepe than for to
singen and to pleye. / For as that seith Salomon: 'who-so that hadde the
science to knowe the peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for sinne,
he wolde make sorwe.' / 'Thilke science,' as seith seint Augustin, 'maketh
a man to waymenten in his herte.' /230

§ 11. The fourthe point, that oghte maken a man to have contricion, is the
sorweful remembrance of the good that he hath left to doon here in erthe;
and eek the good that he hath lorn. / Soothly, the gode werkes that he hath
left, outher they been the gode werkes that he wroghte er he fel in-to
deedly sinne, or elles the gode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in
sinne. / Soothly, the gode werkes, that he dide biforn that he fil in
sinne, been al mortified and astoned and dulled by the ofte sinning. / The
othere gode werkes, that he wroghte whyl he lay in deedly sinne, they been
outrely dede as to the lyf perdurable in hevene. / Thanne thilke gode
werkes that been mortified by ofte sinning, whiche gode werkes he dide whyl
he was in charitee, ne mowe nevere quiken agayn with-outen verray
penitence. /235 And ther-of seith god, by the mouth of Ezechiel: that, 'if
the rightful man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke
wikkednesse, shal he live?' / Nay; for alle the gode werkes that he hath
wroght ne shul nevere been in remembrance; for he shal dyen in his sinne. /
And up-on thilke chapitre seith seint Gregorie thus: 'that we shulle
understonde this principally; / that whan we doon deedly sinne, it is for
noght thanne to rehercen or drawen in-to memorie the gode werkes that we
han wroght biforn.' / For certes, in the werkinge of the deedly sinne, ther
is no trust to no good werk that we han doon biforn; that is to seyn, as
for to have therby the lyf perdurable in hevene. /240 But nathelees, the
gode werkes quiken agayn, and comen agayn, and helpen, and availlen to have
the lyf perdurable in hevene, whan we han contricion. / But soothly, the
gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly sinne, for-as-muche as
they were doon in deedly sinne, they may nevere quiken agayn. / For certes,
thing that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quikene; and nathelees, al-be-it
that [581] they ne availle noght to han the lyf perdurable, yet availlen
they to abregge of the peyne of helle, or elles to geten temporal richesse,
/ or elles that god wole the rather enlumine and lightne the herte of the
sinful man to have repentance; / and eek they availlen for to usen a man to
doon gode werkes, that the feend have the lasse power of his soule. /245
And thus the curteis lord Iesu Crist wole that no good werk be lost; for in
somwhat it shal availle. / But for-as-muche as the gode werkes that men
doon whyl they been in good lyf, been al mortified by sinne folwinge; and
eek, sith that alle the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly
synne, been outrely dede as for to have the lyf perdurable; / wel may that
man, that no good werke ne dooth, singe thilke newe Frenshe song: "_Iay
tout perdu mon temps et mon labour_." / For certes, sinne bireveth a man
bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the goodnesse of grace. / For soothly,
the grace of the holy goost fareth lyk fyr, that may nat been ydel; for fyr
faileth anoon as it forleteth his wirkinge, and right so grace fayleth
anoon as it forleteth his werkinge. /250 Than leseth the sinful man the
goodnesse of glorie, that only is bihight to gode men that labouren and
werken. / Wel may he be sory thanne, that oweth al his lif to god as longe
as he hath lived, and eek as longe as he shal live, that no goodnesse ne
hath to paye with his dette to god, to whom he oweth al his lyf. / For
trust wel, 'he shal yeven acountes,' as seith seint Bernard, 'of alle the
godes that han be yeven him in this present lyf, and how he hath hem
despended; / in so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer of his heed, ne
a moment of an houre ne shal nat perisse of his tyme, that he ne shal yeve
of it a rekening.' /

§ 12. The fifthe thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is remembrance
of the passion that oure lord Iesu Crist suffred for our sinnes. /255 For,
as seith seint Bernard: 'whyl that I live, I shal have remembrance of the
travailles that oure lord Crist suffred in preching; / his werinesse in
travailling, hise temptacions whan he fasted, hise longe wakinges whan he
preyde, hise teres whan that he weep for pitee of good peple; / the wo and
the shame and the filthe that men seyden to him; of the foule spitting that
men spitte in his face, of the buffettes that men yaven [582] him, of the
foule mowes, and of the repreves that men to him seyden; / of the nayles
with whiche he was nailed to the croys, and of al the remenant of his
passion that he suffred for my sinnes, and no-thing for his gilt.' / And ye
shul understonde, that in mannes sinne is every manere of ordre or
ordinance turned up-so-doun. /260 For it is sooth, that god, and reson, and
sensualitee, and the body of man been so ordeyned, that everich of thise
foure thinges sholde have lordshipe over that other; / as thus: god sholde
have lordshipe over reson, and reson over sensualitee, and sensualitee over
the body of man. / But sothly, whan man sinneth, al this ordre or ordinance
is turned up-so-doun. / And therfore thanne, for-as-muche as the reson of
man ne wol nat be subget ne obeisant to god, that is his lord by right,
therfore leseth it the lordshipe that it sholde have over sensualitee, and
eek over the body of man. / And why? For sensualitee rebelleth thanne
agayns reson; and by that wey leseth reson the lordshipe over sensualitee
and over the body. /265 For right as reson is rebel to god, right so is
bothe sensualitee rebel to reson and the body also. / And certes, this
disordinance and this rebellion oure lord Iesu Crist aboghte up-on his
precious body ful dere, and herkneth in which wyse. / For-as-muche thanne
as reson is rebel to god, therfore is man worthy to have sorwe and to be
deed. / This suffred oure lord Iesu Crist for man, after that he hadde be
bitraysed of his disciple, and distreyned and bounde, 'so that his blood
brast out at every nail of hise handes,' as seith seint Augustin. / And
forther-over, for-as-muchel as reson of man ne wol nat daunte sensualitee
whan it may, therfore is man worthy to have shame; and this suffred oure
lord Iesu Crist for man, whan they spetten in his visage. /270 And
forther-over, for-as-muchel thanne as the caitif body of man is rebel bothe
to reson and to sensualitee, therfore is it worthy the deeth. / And this
suffred oure lord Iesu Crist for man up-on the croys, where-as ther was no
part of his body free, withouten greet peyne and bitter passion. / And al
this suffred Iesu Crist, that nevere forfeted. And therfore resonably may
be seyd of Iesu in this manere: 'to muchel am I peyned for the thinges that
I nevere deserved, and to muche defouled for shend-shipe that man is worthy
to have.' / And therfore may the sinful [583] man wel seye, as seith seint
Bernard: 'acursed be the bitternesse of my sinne, for which ther moste be
suffred so muchel bitternesse.' / For certes, after the diverse
discordances of oure wikkednesses, was the passion of Iesu Crist ordeyned
in diverse thinges, /275 as thus. Certes, sinful mannes soule is bitraysed
of the devel by coveitise of temporel prosperitee, and scorned by deceite
whan he cheseth fleshly delyces; and yet is it tormented by inpacience of
adversitee, and bispet by servage and subieccion of sinne; and atte laste
it is slayn fynally. / For this disordinaunce of sinful man was Iesu Crist
first bitraysed, and after that was he bounde, that cam for to unbynden us
of sinne and peyne. / Thanne was he biscorned, that only sholde han been
honoured in alle thinges and of alle thinges. / Thanne was his visage, that
oghte be desired to be seyn of al man-kinde, in which visage aungels
desyren to looke, vileynsly bispet. / Thanne was he scourged that no-thing
hadde agilt; and fynally, thanne was he crucified and slayn. /280 Thanne
was acompliced the word of Isaye: 'he was wounded for oure misdedes, and
defouled for oure felonies.' / Now sith that Iesu Crist took up-on him-self
the peyne of alle oure wikkednesses, muchel oghte sinful man wepen and
biwayle, that for hise sinnes goddes sone of hevene sholde al this peyne
endure. /

§ 13. The sixte thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is the hope of
three thynges; that is to seyn, foryifnesse of sinne, and the yifte of
grace wel for to do, and the glorie of hevene, with which god shal guerdone
a man for hise gode dedes. / And for-as-muche as Iesu Crist yeveth us thise
yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee, therfore is he cleped
_Iesus Nazarenus rex Iudeorum._ / Iesus is to seyn 'saveour' or
'salvacion,' on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of sinnes, which
that is proprely salvacion of sinnes. /285 And therfore seyde the aungel to
Ioseph: 'thou shall clepen his name Iesus, that shal saven his peple of hir
sinnes.' / And heer-of seith seint Peter: 'ther is noon other name under
hevene that is yeve to any man, by which a man may be saved, but only
Iesus.' / _Nazarenus_ is as muche for to seye as 'florisshinge,' in which a
man shal hope, that he that yeveth him remission of sinnes shal yeve him
eek grace wel [584] for to do. For in the flour is hope of fruit in tyme
cominge; and in foryifnesse of sinnes hope of grace wel for to do. / 'I was
atte dore of thyn herte,' seith Iesus, 'and cleped for to entre; he that
openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of sinne. / I wol entre in-to him by my
grace, and soupe with him,' by the goode werkes that he shal doon; whiche
werkes been the foode of god; 'and he shal soupe with me,' by the grete
Ioye that I shal yeven him. /290 Thus shal man hope, for hise werkes of
penaunce, that god shall yeven him his regne; as he bihoteth him in the
gospel. /

§ 14. Now shal a man understonde, in which manere shal been his contricion.
I seye, that it shal been universal and total; this is to seyn, a man shal
be verray repentant for alle hise sinnes that he hath doon in delyt of his
thoght; for delyt is ful perilous. / For ther been two manere of
consentinges; that oon of hem is cleped consentinge of affeccion, when a
man is moeved to do sinne, and delyteth him longe for to thinke on that
sinne; / and his reson aperceyveth it wel, that it is sinne agayns the lawe
of god, and yet his reson refreyneth nat his foul delyt or talent, though
he se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of god; al-though his
reson ne consente noght to doon that sinne in dede, / yet seyn somme
doctours that swich delyt that dwelleth longe, it is ful perilous, al be it
nevere so lite. /295 And also a man sholde sorwe, namely, for al that evere
he hath desired agayn the lawe of god with perfit consentinge of his reson;
for ther-of is no doute, that it is deedly sinne in consentinge. / For
certes, ther is no deedly sinne, that it nas first in mannes thought, and
after that in his delyt; and so forth in-to consentinge and in-to dede. /
Wherfore I seye, that many men ne repenten hem nevere of swiche thoghtes
and delytes, ne nevere shryven hem of it, but only of the dede of grete
sinnes outward. / Wherfore I seye, that swiche wikked delytes and wikked
thoghtes been subtile bigyleres of hem that shullen be dampned. /
More-over, man oghte to sorwe for hise wikkede wordes as wel as for hise
wikkede dedes; for certes, the repentance of a singuler sinne, and nat
repente of alle hise othere sinnes, or elles repenten him of alle hise
othere sinnes, and nat of a singuler sinne, may nat availle. /300 For
certes, god almighty is al good; and ther-fore he foryeveth al, [585] or
elles right noght. / And heer-of seith seint Augustin: 'I woot certainly /
that god is enemy to everich sinnere'; and how thanne? He that observeth o
sinne, shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of hise othere sinnes?
Nay. / And forther-over, contricion sholde be wonder sorweful and
anguissous, and therfore yeveth him god pleynly his mercy; and therfore,
whan my soule was anguissous with-inne me, I hadde remembrance of god that
my preyere mighte come to him. / Forther-over, contricion moste be
continuel, and that man have stedefast purpos to shryven him, and for to
amenden him of his lyf. /305 For soothly, whyl contricion lasteth, man may
evere have hope of foryifnesse; and of this comth hate of sinne, that
destroyeth sinne bothe in himself, and eek in other folk, at his power. /
For which seith David: 'ye that loven god hateth wikkednesse.' For trusteth
wel, to love god is for to love that he loveth, and hate that he hateth. /

    303. E. _om._ I woot certeinly.   305. E. continueel.

§ 15. The laste thing that man shal understonde in contricion is this;
wher-of avayleth contricion. I seye, that som tyme contricion delivereth a
man fro sinne; / of which that David seith: 'I seye,' quod David, that is
to seyn, 'I purposed fermely to shryve me; and thow, Lord, relesedest my
sinne.' / And right so as contricion availleth noght, with-outen sad purpos
of shrifte, if man have oportunitee, right so litel worth is shrifte or
satisfaccion with-outen contricion. /310 And more-over, contricion
destroyeth the prison of helle, and maketh wayk and feble alle the
strengthes of the develes, and restoreth the yiftes of the holy goost and
of alle gode vertues; / and it clenseth the soule of sinne, and delivereth
the soule fro the peyne of helle, and fro the companye of the devel, and
fro the servage of sinne, and restoreth it to alle godes espirituels, and
to the companye and communion of holy chirche. / And forther-over, it
maketh him that whylom was sone of ire to be sone of grace; and alle thise
thinges been preved by holy writ. / And therfore, he that wolde sette his
entente to thise thinges, he were ful wys; for soothly, he ne sholde nat
thanne in al his lyf have corage to sinne, but yeven his body and al his
herte to the service of Iesu Crist, and ther-of doon him hommage. / For
soothly, oure swete lord Iesu Crist hath spared [586] us so debonairly in
our folies, that if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule, a sory song we

§ 16. The seconde partie of Penitence is Confession, that is signe of

    317. E. wheither.

sinnes to the preest; / this is to seyn 'verray,' for he moste confessen
him of alle the condiciouns that bilongen to his sinne, as ferforth as he
can. / Al moot be seyd, and no thing excused ne hid ne forwrapped, and
noght avaunte him of his gode werkes. /320 And forther over, it is
necessarie to understonde whennes that sinnes springen, and how they
encresen, and whiche they been. /

    320. him of his] E. Cm. thee of thy.   321. E. encreessen.

§ 18. Of the springinge of sinnes seith seint Paul in this wise: that
'right as by a man sinne entred first in-to this world, and thurgh that
sinne deeth, right so thilke deeth entred in-to alle men that sinneden.' /
And this man was Adam, by whom sinne entred in-to this world whan he brak
the comaundement of god. / And therfore, he that first was so mighty that
he sholde not have dyed, bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye, whether
he wolde or noon; and all his progenie in this world that in thilke man
sinneden. / Loke that in thestaat of innocence, when Adam and Eve naked
weren in paradys, and no-thing ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse, /325 how
that the serpent, that was most wyly of alle othere bestes that god hadde
maked, seyde to the womman: 'why comaunded god to yow, ye sholde nat eten
of every tree in paradys?' / The womman answerde: 'of the fruit,' quod she,
'of the trees in paradys we feden us; but soothly, of the fruit of the tree
that is in the middel of paradys, god forbad us for to ete, ne nat touchen
it, lest per-aventure we should dyen.' / The serpent seyde to the womman:
'nay, nay, ye shul nat dyen of deeth; for sothe, god woot, that what day
that ye eten ther-of, youre eyen shul opene, and ye shul been as goddes,
knowinge [587] good and harm.' / The womman thanne saugh that the tree was
good to feding, and fair to the eyen, and delytable to the sighte; she tok
of the fruit of the tree, and eet it, and yaf to hir housbonde, and he eet;
and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden. / And whan that they knewe that
they were naked, they sowed of fige-leves a manere of breches to hiden hir
membres. /330 There may ye seen that deedly sinne hath first suggestion of
the feend, as sheweth here by the naddre; and afterward, the delyt of the
flesh, as sheweth here by Eve; and after that, the consentinge of resoun,
as sheweth here by Adam. / For trust wel, thogh so were that the feend
tempted Eve, that is to seyn the flesh, and the flesh hadde delyt in the
beautee of the fruit defended, yet certes, til that resoun, that is to
seyn, Adam, consented to the etinge of the fruit, yet stood he in thestaat
of innocence. / Of thilke Adam toke we thilke sinne original; for of him
fleshly descended be we alle, and engendred of vile and corrupt matere. /
And whan the soule is put in our body, right anon is contract original
sinne; and that, that was erst but only peyne of concupiscence, is
afterward bothe peyne and sinne. / And therfore be we alle born sones of
wratthe and of dampnacion perdurable, if it nere baptesme that we receyven,
which binimeth us the culpe; but for sothe, the peyne dwelleth with us, as
to temptacion, which peyne highte concupiscence. /335 Whan it is wrongfully
disposed or ordeyned in man, it maketh him coveite, by coveitise of flesh,
fleshly sinne, by sighte of hise eyen as to erthely thinges. and coveitise
of hynesse by pryde of herte. /

§ 19. Now as for to speken of the firste coveitise, that is, concupiscence
after the lawe of oure membres, that weren lawe-fulliche y-maked and by
rightful Iugement of god; / I seye, for-as-muche as man is nat obeisaunt to
god, that is his lord, therfore is the flesh to him disobeisaunt thurgh
concupiscence, which yet is cleped norissinge of sinne and occasion of
sinne. / Therfore, al the whyle that a man hath in him the peyne of
concupiscence, it is impossible but he be tempted somtyme, and moeved in
his flesh to sinne. And this thing may nat faille as longe as he liveth; it
may wel wexe feble and faille, by vertu of baptesme and by the grace of god
thurgh penitence; /340 but fully [588] ne shal it nevere quenche, that he
ne shal som tyme be moeved in him-self, but-if he were al refreyded by
siknesse, or by malefice of sorcerie or colde drinkes. / For lo, what seith
seint Paul: 'the flesh coveiteth agayn the spirit, and the spirit agayn the
flesh; they been so contrarie and so stryven, that a man may nat alwey doon
as he wolde.' / The same seint Paul, after his grete penaunce in water and
in lond (in water by night and by day, in greet peril and in greet peyne,
in lond, in famine, in thurst, in cold and clothlees, and ones stoned
almost to the deeth) / yet seyde he: 'allas! I, caytif man, who shal
delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytif body?' / And seint Ierome, whan he
longe tyme hadde woned in desert, where-as he hadde no companye but of
wilde bestes, where-as he ne hadde no mete but herbes and water to his
drinke, ne no bed but the naked erthe, for which his flesh was blak as an
Ethiopen for hete and ny destroyed for cold, /345 yet seyde he: that 'the
brenninge of lecherie boiled in al his body.' / Wherfore I woot wel
sikerly, that they been deceyved that seyn, that they ne be nat tempted in
hir body. / Witnesse on Seint Iame the Apostel, that seith: that 'every
wight is tempted in his owen concupiscence': that is to seyn, that everich
of us hath matere and occasion to be tempted of the norissinge of sinne
that is in his body. / And therfore seith Seint Iohn the Evaungelist: 'if
that we seyn that we beth with-oute sinne, we deceyve us-selve, and trouthe
is nat in us.' /

§ 20. Now shal ye understonde in what manere that sinne wexeth or encreseth
in man. The firste thing is thilke norissinge of sinne, of which I spak
biforn, thilke fleshly concupiscence. /350 And after that comth the
subieccion of the devel, this is to seyn, the develes bely, with which he
bloweth in man the fyr of fleshly concupiscence. / And after that, a man
bithinketh him whether he wol doon, or no, thilke thing to which he is
tempted. / And thanne, if that a man withstonde and weyve the firste
entysinge of his flesh and of the feend, thanne is it no sinne; and if it
so be that he do nat so, thanne feleth he anon a flambe of delyt. / And
thanne is it good to be war, and kepen him wel, or elles he wol falle anon
in-to consentinge of sinne; and thanne wol he do it, if he may have tyme
and place. / And of this matere seith Moyses by the devel in this manere:
'the feend seith, I wole [589] chace and pursue the man by wikked
suggestion, and I wole hente him by moevynge or stiringe of sinne. I wol
departe my pryse or my praye by deliberacion, and my lust shal been
accompliced in delyt; I wol drawe my swerd in consentinge:' /355 for
certes, right as a swerd departeth a thing in two peces, right so
consentinge departeth god fro man: 'and thanne wol I sleen him with myn
hand in dede of sinne'; thus seith the feend. / For certes, thanne is a man
al deed in soule. And thus is sinne accompliced by temptacion, by delyt,
and by consentinge; and thanne is the sin cleped actuel. /

§ 21. For sothe, sinne is in two maneres; outher it is venial, or deedly
sinne. Soothly, whan man loveth any creature more than Iesu Crist oure
creatour, thanne is it deedly sinne. And venial synne is it, if man love
Iesu Crist lasse than him oghte. / For sothe, the dede of this venial sinne
is ful perilous; for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to god more
and more. / And therfore, if a man charge him-self with manye swiche venial
sinnes, certes, but-if so be that he som tyme descharge him of hem by
shrifte, they mowe ful lightly amenuse in him al the love that he hath to
Iesu Crist; /360 and in this wise skippeth venial in-to deedly sinne. For
certes, the more that a man chargeth his soule with venial sinnes, the more
is he enclyned to fallen in-to deedly sinne. / And therfore, lat us nat be
necligent to deschargen us of venial sinnes. For the proverbe seith: that
manye smale maken a greet. / And herkne this ensample. A greet wawe of the
see comth som-tyme with so greet a violence that it drencheth the ship. And
the same harm doth som-tyme the smale dropes of water, that entren thurgh a
litel crevace in-to the thurrok, and in-to the botme of the ship, if men be
so necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by tyme. / And therfore,
al-thogh ther be a difference bitwixe thise two causes of drenchinge,
algates the ship is dreynt. / Right so fareth it somtyme of deedly sinne,
and of anoyouse veniale sinnes, whan they multiplye in a man so greetly,
that thilke worldly thinges that he loveth, thurgh whiche he sinneth
venially, is as greet in his herte as the love of god, or more. /365 And
therfore, the love of every thing, that is nat biset in god ne doon
principally for goddes sake, al-though that a man love [590] it lasse than
god, yet is it venial sinne; / and deedly sinne, whan the love of any thing
weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of god, or more. / 'Deedly
sinne,' as seith seint Augustin, 'is, whan a man turneth his herte fro god,
which that is verray sovereyn bountee, that may nat chaunge, and yeveth his
herte to thing that may chaunge and flitte'; / and certes, that is every
thing, save god of hevene. For sooth is, that if a man yeve his love, the
which that he oweth al to god with al his herte, un-to a creature, certes,
as muche of his love as he yeveth to thilke creature, so muche he bireveth
fro god; / and therfore doth he sinne. For he, that is dettour to god, ne
yeldeth nat to god al his dette, that is to seyn, al the love of his herte.

§ 22. Now sith man understondeth generally, which is venial sinne, thanne
is it covenable to tellen specially of sinnes whiche that many a man
per-aventure ne demeth hem nat sinnes, and ne shryveth him nat of the same
thinges; and yet nathelees they been sinnes. / Soothly, as thise clerkes
wryten, this is to seyn, that at every tyme that a man eteth or drinketh
more than suffyseth to the sustenaunce of his body, in certein he dooth
sinne. / And eek whan he speketh more than nedeth, it is sinne. Eke whan he
herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre. / Eke whan he is in hele
of body and wol nat faste, whan othere folk faste, withouten cause
resonable. Eke whan he slepeth more than nedeth, or whan he comth by thilke
enchesoun to late to chirche, or to othere werkes of charite. / Eke whan he
useth his wyf, withouten sovereyn desyr of engendrure, to the honour of
god, or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the dette of his body. /375 Eke
whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner, if he may. Eke if he love
wyf or child, or other worldly thing, more than resoun requyreth. Eke if he
flatere or blandishe more than him oghte for any necessitee. / Eke if he
amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre. Eke if he apparailleth his
mete more deliciously than nede is, or ete it to hastily by likerousnesse.
/ Eke if he tale vanitees at chirche or at goddes service, or that he be a
talker ot ydel wordes of folye or of vileinye; for he shal yelden acountes
of it at the day of dome. / Eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do [591]
thinges that he may nat perfourne. Eke whan that he, by lightnesse or
folie, misseyeth or scorneth his neighebore. / Eke whan he hath any wikked
suspecion of thing, ther he ne woot of it no soothfastnesse. /380 Thise
thinges and mo with-oute nombre been sinnes, as seith seint Augustin. /

Now shal men understonde, that al-be-it so that noon erthely man may eschue
alle venial sinnes, yet may he refreyne him by the brenninge love that he
hath to oure lord Iesu Crist, and by preyeres and confession and othere
gode werkes, so that it shal but litel greve. / For, as seith seint
Augustin: 'if a man love god in swiche manere, that al that evere he doth
is in the love of god, and for the love of god verraily, for he brenneth in
the love of god: / loke, how muche that a drope of water that falleth in a
fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth or greveth, so muche anoyeth a venial sinne
un-to a man that is parfit in the love of Iesu Crist.' / Men may also
refreyne venial sinne by receyvinge worthily of the precious body of Iesu
Crist; /385 by receyving eek of holy water; by almesdede; by general
confession of _Confiteor_ at masse and at complin; and by blessinge of
bisshopes and of preestes, and by othere gode werkes. /

§ 23. Now is it bihovely thing to telle whiche been the deedly sinnes, this
is to seyn, chieftaines of sinnes; alle they renne in o lees, but in
diverse maneres. Now been they cleped chieftaines for-as-muche as they been
chief, and springers of alle othere sinnes. / Of the roote of thise sevene
sinnes thanne is Pryde, the general rote of alle harmes; for of this rote
springen certein braunches, as Ire, Envye, Accidie or Slewthe, Avarice or
Coveitise (to commune understondinge), Glotonye, and Lecherye. / And
everich of thise chief sinnes hath hise braunches and hise twigges, as shal
be declared in hir chapitres folwinge. /

DE SUPERBIA.

§ 24. And thogh so be that no man can outrely telle the [592] nombre of the
twigges and of the harmes that cometh of Pryde, yet wol I shewe a partie of
hem, as ye shul understonde. /390 Ther is Inobedience, Avauntinge,
Ipocrisie, Despyt, Arrogance, Impudence, Swellinge of herte, Insolence,
Elacion, Impacience, Strif, Contumacie, Presumpcion, Irreverence,
Pertinacie, Veyne Glorie; and many another twig that I can nat declare. /
Inobedient, is he that disobeyeth for despyt to the comandements of god and
to hise sovereyns, and to his goostly fader. / Avauntour, is he that
bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he hath doon. / Ipocrite, is he
that hydeth to shewe him swiche as he is, and sheweth him swiche as he
noght is. / Despitous, is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebore, that is
to seyn, of his evene-cristene, or hath despyt to doon that him oghte to
do. /395 Arrogant, is he that thinketh that he hath thilke bountees in him
that he hath noght, or weneth that he sholde have hem by hise desertes; or
elles he demeth that he be that he nis nat. / Impudent, is he that for his
pride hath no shame of hise sinnes. / Swellinge of herte, is whan a man
reioyseth him of harm that he hath doon. / Insolent, is he that despyseth
in his Iugement alle othere folk as to regard of his value, and of his
conning, and of his speking, and of his bering. / Elacion, is whan he ne
may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe. /400 Impacient, is he that
wol nat been y-taught ne undernome of his vyce, and by stryf werreieth
trouthe witingly, and deffendeth his folye. / _Contumax_, is he that thurgh
his indignacion is agayns everich auctoritee or power of hem that been hise
sovereyns. / Presumpcion, is whan a man undertaketh an empryse that him
oghte nat do, or elles that he may nat do; and that is called Surquidrie.
Irreverence, is whan men do nat honour thereas hem oghte to doon, and
waiten to be reverenced. / Pertinacie, is whan man deffendeth his folye,
and trusteth to muchel in his owene wit. / Veyne glorie, is for to have
pompe and delyt in his temporel hynesse, and glorifie him in this worldly
estaat. /405 Ianglinge, is whan men speken to muche biforn folk, and
clappen as a mille, and taken no kepe what they seye. /

§ 25. And yet is ther a privee spece of Pryde, that waiteth first to be
salewed er he wole salewe, al be he lasse worth than that [593] other is,
per-aventure; and eek he waiteth or desyreth to sitte, or elles to goon
above him in the wey, or kisse pax, or been encensed, or goon to offring
biforn his neighebore, / and swiche semblable thinges; agayns his duetee,
per-aventure, but that he hath his herte and his entente in swich a proud
desyr to be magnifyed and honoured biforn the peple. /

§ 26. Now been ther two maneres of Pryde; that oon of hem is with-inne the
herte of man, and that other is with-oute. / Of whiche soothly thise
forseyde thinges, and mo than I have seyd, apertenen to pryde that is in
the herte of man; and that othere speces of pryde been with-oute. /410 But
natheles that oon of thise speces of pryde is signe of that other, right as
the gaye leefsel atte taverne is signe of the wyn that is in the celer. /
And this is in manye thinges: as in speche and contenaunce, and in
outrageous array of clothing; / for certes, if ther ne hadde be no sinne in
clothing, Crist wolde nat have noted and spoken of the clothing of thilke
riche man in the gospel. / And, as seith Seint Gregorie, that precious
clothing is coupable for the derthe of it, and for his softenesse, and for
his strangenesse and degysinesse, and for the superfluitee, or for the
inordinat scantnesse of it. / Allas! may men nat seen, as in oure dayes,
the sinful costlewe array of clothinge, and namely in to muche
superfluitee, or elles in to desordinat scantnesse? /415

§ 27. As to the firste sinne, that is in superfluitee of clothinge, which
that maketh it so dere, to harm of the peple; / nat only the cost of
embroudinge, the degyse endentinge or barringe, oundinge, palinge,
windinge, or bendinge, and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee; / but ther
is also costlewe furringe in hir gounes, so muche pounsoninge of chisels to
maken holes, so muche dagginge of sheres; / forth-with the superfluitee in
lengthe of the forseide gounes, trailinge in the dong and in the myre, on
horse and eek on fote, as wel of man as of womman, that al thilke trailing
is verraily as in effect wasted, consumed, thredbare, and roten with donge,
rather than it is yeven to the povre; to greet [594] damage of the forseyde
povre folk. / And that in sondry wyse: this is to seyn, that the more that
clooth is wasted, the more it costeth to the peple for the scantnesse; /420
and forther-over, if so be that they wolde yeven swich pounsoned and dagged
clothing to the povre folk, it is nat convenient to were for hir estaat, ne
suffisant to bete hir necessitee, to kepe hem fro the distemperance of the
firmament. / Upon that other syde, to speken of the horrible disordinat
scantnesse of clothing, as been thise cutted sloppes or hainselins, that
thurgh hir shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres of man, to wikked
entente. / Allas! somme of hem shewen the boce of hir shap, and the
horrible swollen membres, that semeth lyk the maladie of hirnia, in the
wrappinge of hir hoses; / and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the
hindre part of a she-ape in the fulle of the mone. / And more-over, the
wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh the degysinge, in
departinge of hir hoses in whyt and reed, semeth that half hir shameful
privee membres weren flayn. /425 And if so be that they departen hire hoses
in othere colours, as is whyt and blak, or whyt and blew, or blak and reed,
and so forth; / thanne semeth it, as by variance of colour, that half the
partie of hir privee membres were corrupt by the fyr of seint Antony, or by
cancre, or by other swich meschaunce. / Of the hindre part of hir buttokes,
it is ful horrible for to see. For certes, in that partie of hir body
ther-as they purgen hir stinkinge ordure, / that foule partie shewe they to
the peple proudly in despyt of honestetee, the which honestetee that Iesu
Crist and hise freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve. / Now as of the
outrageous array of wommen, god woot, that though the visages of somme of
hem seme ful chaast and debonaire, yet notifie they in hir array of atyr
likerousnesse and pryde. /430 I sey nat that honestetee in clothinge of man
or womman is uncovenable, but certes the superfluitee or disordinat
scantitee of clothinge is reprevable. / Also the sinne of aornement or of
apparaille is in thinges that apertenen to rydinge, as in to manye delicat
horses that been holden for delyt, that been so faire, fatte, and costlewe;
/ and also to many a vicious knave that is sustened [595] by cause of hem;
in to curious harneys, as in sadeles, in crouperes, peytrels, and brydles
covered with precious clothing and riche, barres and plates of gold and of
silver. / For which god seith by Zakarie the prophete, 'I wol confounde the
ryderes of swiche horses.' / This folk taken litel reward of the rydinge of
goddes sone of hevene, and of his harneys whan he rood up-on the asse, and
ne hadde noon other harneys but the povre clothes of hise disciples; ne we
ne rede nat that evere he rood on other beest. /435 I speke this for the
sinne of superfluitee, and nat for reasonable honestetee, whan reson it
requyreth. / And forther, certes pryde is greetly notified in holdinge of
greet meinee, whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit. / And
namely, whan that meinee is felonous and damageous to the peple, by
hardinesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices. / For certes, swiche
lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of helle, whanne they
sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meinee. / Or elles whan this folk of lowe
degree, as thilke that holden hostelries, sustenen the thefte of hir
hostilers, and that is in many manere of deceites. /440 Thilke manere of
folk been the flyes that folwen the hony, or elles the houndes that folwen
the careyne. Swiche forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes; /
for which thus seith David the prophete, 'wikked deeth mote come up-on
thilke lordshipes, and god yeve that they mote descenden in-to helle al
doun; for in hir houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses,' and nat god of
hevene. / And certes, but-if they doon amendement, right as god yaf his
benison to Laban by the service of Iacob, and to Pharao by the service of
Joseph, right so god wol yeve his malison to swiche lordshipes as sustenen
the wikkednesse of hir servaunts, but-if they come to amendement. / Pryde
of the table appereth eek ful ofte; for certes, riche men been cleped to
festes, and povre folk been put awey and rebuked. / Also in excesse of
diverse metes and drinkes; and namely, swiche manere bake metes and
dish-metes, brenninge of wilde fyr, and peynted and castelled with papir,
and semblable wast; so that it is abusion for to thinke. /445 And eek in to
greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee of minstralcie, by whiche a
man is stired the more to delyces of luxurie, / [596] if so be that he
sette his herte the lasse up-on oure lord Iesu Crist, certein it is a
sinne; and certeinly the delyces mighte been so grete in this caas, that
man mighte lightly falle by hem in-to deedly sinne. / The especes that
sourden of pryde, soothly whan they sourden of malice ymagined, avysed, and
forncast, or elles of usage, been deedly synnes, it is no doute. / And whan
they sourden by freletee unavysed sodeinly, and sodeinly withdrawen ayein,
al been they grevouse sinnes, I gesse that they ne been nat deedly. / Now
mighte men axe wher-of that Pryde sourdeth and springeth, and I seye:
somtyme it springeth of the goodes of nature, and som-tyme of the goodes of
fortune, and som-tyme of the goodes of grace. /450 Certes, the goodes of
nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in goodes of soule. / Certes,
goodes of body been hele of body, as strengthe, delivernesse, beautee,
gentrye, franchise. / Goodes of nature of the soule been good wit, sharp
understondynge, subtil engin, vertu naturel, good memorie. / Goodes of
fortune been richesses, highe degrees of lordshipes, preisinges of the
peple. / Goodes of grace been science, power to suffre spirituel travaille,
benignitee, vertuous contemplacion, withstondinge of temptacion, and
semblable thinges. /455 Of whiche forseyde goodes, certes it is a ful greet
folye a man to pryden him in any of hem alle. / Now as for to speken of
goodes of nature, god woot that som-tyme we han hem in nature as muche to
oure damage as to oure profit. / As, for to speken of hele of body; certes
it passeth ful lightly, and eek it is ful ofte encheson of the siknesse of
oure soule; for god woot, the flesh is a ful greet enemy to the soule: and
therfore, the more that the body is hool, the more be we in peril to falle.
/ Eke for to pryde him in his strengthe of body, it is an heigh folye; for
certes, the flesh coveiteth agayn the spirit, and ay the more strong that
the flesh is, the sorier may the soule be: / and, over al this, strengthe
of body and worldly hardinesse causeth ful ofte many a man to peril and
meschaunce. /460 Eek for to pryde him of his gentrye is ful greet folye;
for ofte tyme the gentrye of the body binimeth the gentrye of the soule;
and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o moder; and alle we been of o nature
roten and corrupt, both riche and povre. / [597] For sothe, o manere
gentrye is for to preise, that apparailleth mannes corage with vertues and
moralitees, and maketh him Cristes child. / For truste wel, that over what
man sinne hath maistrie, he is a verray cherl to sinne. /

attayne to heighe vertuouse thinges. / Now certes, a man to pryde him in
the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folye; for thilke yiftes of grace
that sholde have turned him to goodnesse and to medicine, turneth him to

REMEDIUM CONTRA PECCATUM SUPERBIE.

§ 29. Now sith that so is, that ye han understonde what is pryde, and
whiche been the speces of it, and whennes pride sourdeth and springeth;
/475 now shul ye understonde which is the remedie agayns the sinne of
pryde, and that is, humilitee or mekenesse. / That is a vertu, thurgh which
a man hath verray knoweleche of him-self, and holdeth of him-self no prys
ne deyntee as in regard of hise desertes, consideringe evere his freletee.
/ Now [598] been ther three maneres of humilitee; as humilitee in herte,
and another humilitee in his mouth; the thridde in hise werkes. / The
humilitee in herte is in foure maneres: that oon is, whan a man holdeth
him-self as noght worth biforn god of hevene. Another is, whan he ne
despyseth noon other man. / The thridde is, whan he rekketh nat thogh men
holde him noght worth. The ferthe is, whan he nis nat sory of his
humiliacion. /480 Also, the humilitee of mouth is in foure thinges: in
attempree speche, and in humblesse of speche, and whan he biknoweth with
his owene mouth that he is swich as him thinketh that he is in his herte.
Another is, whan he preiseth the bountee of another man, and nothing
ther-of amenuseth. / Humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres: the
firste is, whan he putteth othere men biforn him. The seconde is, to chese
the loweste place over-al. The thridde is, gladly to assente to good
conseil. / The ferthe is, to stonde gladly to the award of hise sovereyns,
or of him that is in hyer degree; certein, this is a greet werk of

SEQUITUR DE INUIDIA.

§ 30. After Pryde wol I speken of the foule sinne of Envye, which is, as by
the word of the philosophre, sorwe of other mannes prosperitee; and after
the word of seint Augustin, it is sorwe of other mannes wele, and Ioye of
othere mennes harm. / This foule sinne is platly agayns the holy goost.
Al-be-it so that every sinne is agayns the holy goost, yet nathelees, for
as muche as bountee aperteneth proprely to the holy goost, and Envye comth
proprely of malice, therfore it is proprely agayn the bountee of the holy
goost. /485 Now hath malice two speces, that is to seyn, hardnesse of herte
in wikkednesse, or elles the flesh of man is so blind, that he considereth
nat that he is in sinne, or rekketh nat that he is in sinne; which is the
hardnesse of the devel. / That other spece of malice is, whan a man
werreyeth trouthe, whan he woot that it is trouthe. And eek, whan he
werreyeth the grace that god hath yeve to his neighebore; and al this is by
Envye. / Certes, thanne is Envye the worste sinne that is. For soothly,
alle othere sinnes been som-tyme only agayns o special vertu; / but certes,
Envye is agayns alle vertues and agayns alle goodnesses; for it is [599]
sory of alle the bountees of his neighebore; and in this manere it is
divers from alle othere sinnes. / For wel unnethe is ther any sinne that it
ne hath som delyt in itself, save only Envye, that evere hath in itself
anguish and sorwe. /490 The speces of Envye been thise: ther is first,
sorwe of other mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee; and prosperitee is
kindely matere of Ioye; thanne is Envye a sinne agayns kinde. / The seconde
spece of Envye is Ioye of other mannes harm; and that is proprely lyk to
the devel, that evere reioyseth him of mannes harm. / Of thise two speces
comth bakbyting; and this sinne of bakbyting or detraccion hath certeine
speces, as thus. Som man preiseth his neighebore by a wikke entente; / for
he maketh alwey a wikked knotte atte laste ende. Alwey he maketh a 'but'
atte laste ende, that is digne of more blame, than worth is al the
preisinge. / The seconde spece is, that if a man be good and dooth or seith
a thing to good entente, the bakbyter wol turne all thilke goodnesse
up-so-doun to his shrewed entente. /495 The thridde is, to amenuse the
bountee of his neighebore. / The fourthe spece of bakbyting is this; that
if men speke goodnesse of a man, thanne wol the bakbyter seyn, 'parfey,
swich a man is yet bet than he'; in dispreisinge of him that men preise. /
The fifte spece is this; for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to the
harm that men speke of other folk. This sinne is ful greet, and ay
encreseth after the wikked entente of the bakbyter. / After bakbyting
cometh grucching or murmuracion; and somtyme it springeth of inpacience
agayns god, and somtyme agayns man. / Agayns god it is, whan a man
gruccheth agayn the peynes of helle, or agayns poverte, or los of catel, or
agayn reyn or tempest; or elles gruccheth that shrewes han prosperitee, or
elles for that goode men han adversitee. /500 And alle thise thinges sholde
men suffre paciently, for they comen by the rightful Iugement and ordinance
of god. / Som-tyme comth grucching of avarice; as Iudas grucched agayns the
Magdaleyne, whan she enoynte the heved of oure lord Iesu Crist with hir
precious oynement. / This maner murmure is swich as whan man gruccheth of
goodnesse that him-self dooth, or that other folk doon of hir owene catel.
/ Som-tyme comth murmure of pryde; as whan Simon the Pharisee grucched
agayn the Magdaleyne, whan she approched to Iesu Crist, and weep at his
feet for hir sinnes. / [600] And somtyme grucching sourdeth of Envye; whan
men discovereth a mannes harm that was privee, or bereth him on hond thing
that is fals. /505 Murmure eek is ofte amonges servaunts, that grucchen
whan hir sovereyns bidden hem doon leveful thinges; / and, for-as-muche as
they dar nat openly withseye the comaundements of hir sovereyns, yet wol
they seyn harm, and grucche, and murmure prively for verray despyt; /
whiche wordes men clepen the develes _Pater-noster_, though so be that the
devel ne hadde nevere _Pater-noster_, but that lewed folk yeven it swich a
name. / Som tyme grucching comth of ire or prive hate, that norisseth
rancour in herte, as afterward I shal declare. / Thanne cometh eek
bitternesse of herte; thurgh which bitternesse every good dede of his
neighebor semeth to him bitter and unsavory. /510 Thanne cometh discord,
that unbindeth alle manere of frendshipe. Thanne comth scorninge, as whan a
man seketh occasioun to anoyen his neighebor, al do he never so weel. /
Thanne comth accusinge, as whan man seketh occasion to anoyen his
neighebor, which that is lyk to the craft of the devel, that waiteth bothe
night and day to accusen us alle. / Thanne comth malignitee, thurgh which a
man anoyeth his neighebor prively if he may; / and if he noght may, algate
his wikked wil ne shal nat wante, as for to brennen his hous prively, or
empoysone or sleen hise bestes, and semblable thinges. /

REMEDIUM CONTRA PECCATUM INUIDIE.

§ 31. Now wol I speke of the remedie agayns this foule sinne of Envye.
First, is the love of god principal, and loving of his neighebor as
him-self; for soothly, that oon ne may nat been withoute that other. /515
And truste wel, that in the name of thy neighebore thou shalt understonde
the name of thy brother; for certes alle we have o fader fleshly, and o
moder, that is to seyn, Adam and Eve; and eek o fader espirituel, and that
is god of hevene. / Thy neighebore artow holden for to love, and wilne him
alle goodnesse; and therfore seith god, 'love thy neighebore as thyselve,'
that is to seyn, to salvacion bothe of lyf and of soule. / And more-over,
thou shalt love him in word, and in benigne amonestinge, and chastysinge;
and conforten him in hise anoyes, and preye [601] for him with al thyn
herte. / And in dede thou shall love him in swich wyse, that thou shalt
doon to him in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene
persone. / And therfore, thou ne shalt doon him no damage in wikked word,
ne harm in his body, ne in his catel, ne in his soule, by entysing of
wikked ensample. /520 Thou shalt nat desyren his wyf, ne none of hise
thinges. Understond eek, that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his
enemy. / Certes man shal loven his enemy by the comandement of god; and
soothly thy frend shaltow love in God. / I seye, thyn enemy shaltow love
for goddes sake, by his comandement. For if it were reson that a man sholde
haten his enemy, for sothe god nolde nat receiven us to his love that been
hise enemys. / Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym,
he shal doon three thinges, as thus. / Agayns hate and rancour of herte, he
shal love him in herte. Agayns chyding and wikkede wordes, he shal preye
for his enemy. And agayn the wikked dede of his enemy, he shal doon him
bountee. /525 For Crist seith, 'loveth youre enemys, and preyeth for hem
that speke yow harm; and eek for hem that yow chacen and pursewen, and doth
bountee to hem that yow haten.' Lo, thus comaundeth us oure lord Iesu
Crist, to do to oure enemys. / For soothly, nature dryveth us to loven oure
freendes, and parfey, oure enemys han more nede to love than oure freendes;
and they that more nede have, certes, to hem shal men doon goodnesse; / and
certes, in thilke dede have we remembrance of the love of Iesu Crist, that
deyde for hise enemys. / And in-as-muche as thilke love is the more grevous
to perfourne, in-so-muche is the more gretter the merite; and therfore the
lovinge of oure enemy hath confounded the venim of the devel. / For right
as the devel is disconfited by humilitee, right so is he wounded to the
deeth by love of oure enemy. /530 Certes, thanne is love the medicine that
casteth out the venim of Envye fro mannes herte. / The speces of this pas
shullen be more largely in hir chapitres folwinge declared. /

SEQUITUR DE IRA.

§ 32. After Envye wol I discryven the sinne of Ire. For soothly, who-so
hath envye upon his neighebor, anon he wole comunly [602] finde him a
matere of wratthe, in word or in dede, agayns him to whom he hath envye. /
And as wel comth Ire of Pryde, as of Envye; for soothly, he that is proude
or envious is lightly wrooth. /

§ 33. This sinne of Ire, after the discryving of seint Augustin, is wikked
wil to been avenged by word or by dede. /535 Ire, after the philosophre, is
the fervent blood of man y-quiked in his herte, thurgh which he wole harm
to him that he hateth. / For certes the herte of man, by eschaufinge and
moevinge of his blood, wexeth so trouble, that he is out of alle Iugement
of resoun. / But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two maneres; that oon
of hem is good, and that other is wikked. / The gode Ire is by Ialousye of
goodnesse, thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse and agayns
wikkednesse; and therfore seith a wys man, that 'Ire is bet than pley.' /
This Ire is with debonairetee, and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse; nat
wrooth agayns the man, but wrooth with the misdede of the man; as seith the
prophete David, _Irascimini et nolite peccare_. /540 Now understondeth,
that wikked Ire is in two maneres, that is to seyn, sodeyn Ire or hastif
Ire, withouten avisement and consentinge of resoun. / The mening and the
sens of this is, that the resoun of man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn
Ire; and thanne it is venial. / Another Ire is ful wikked, that comth of
felonye of herte avysed and cast biforn; with wikked wil to do vengeance,
and therto his resoun consenteth; and soothly this is deedly sinne. / This
Ire is so displesant to god, that it troubleth his hous and chaceth the
holy goost out of mannes soule, and wasteth and destroyeth the lyknesse of
god, that is to seyn, the vertu that is in mannes soule; / and put in him
the lyknesse of the devel, and binimeth the man fro god that is his
rightful lord. /545 This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel; for it
is the develes fourneys, that is eschaufed with the fyr of helle. / For
certes, right so as fyr is more mighty to destroyen erthely thinges than
any other element, right so Ire is mighty to destroyen alle spirituel
thinges. / Loke how that fyr of smale gledes, that been almost dede under
asshen, wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brimstoon; right so
Ire wol everemo quiken agayn, whan it is touched by the pryde that is
covered in mannes herte. / For certes fyr ne may nat comen out of no-thing,
but-if it were first in the same thing naturelly; as fyr is drawen out of
flintes [603] with steel. / And right so as pryde is ofte tyme matere of
Ire, right so is rancour norice and keper of Ire. /550 Ther is a maner
tree, as seith seint Isidre, that whan men maken fyr of thilke tree, and
covere the coles of it with asshen, soothly the fyr of it wol lasten al a
yeer or more. / And right so fareth it of rancour; whan it is ones
conceyved in the hertes of som men, certein, it wol lasten peraventure from
oon Estre-day unto another Estre-day, and more. / But certes, thilke man is
ful fer fro the mercy of god al thilke while. /

that ay bloweth and encreseth the fyr by chydinge and wikked wordes. /
Thanne stant Envye, and holdeth the hote iren upon the herte of man with a
peire of longe tonges of long rancour. /555 And thanne stant the sinne of
contumelie or stryf and cheeste, and batereth and forgeth by vileyns
reprevinges. / Certes, this cursed sinne anoyeth bothe to the man him-self
and eek to his neighebor. For soothly, almost al the harm that any man
dooth to his neighebore comth of wratthe. / For certes, outrageous wratthe
doth al that evere the devel him comaundeth; for he ne spareth neither
Crist, ne his swete mooder. / And in his outrageous anger and Ire, allas!
allas! ful many oon at that tyme feleth in his herte ful wikkedly, bothe of
Crist and of alle hise halwes. / Is nat this a cursed vice? Yis, certes.
Allas! it binimeth from man his wit and his resoun, and al his debonaire
lyf espirituel that sholde kepen his soule. /560 Certes, it binimeth eek
goddes due lordshipe, and that is mannes soule, and the love of hise
neighebores. It stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe. It reveth him the quiete
of his herte, and subverteth his soule. /

§ 35. Of Ire comen thise stinkinge engendrures: first hate, that is old
wratthe; discord, thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he hath
loved ful longe. / And thanne cometh werre, and every manere of wrong that
man dooth to his neighebore, in body or in catel. / Of this cursed sinne of
Ire cometh eek manslaughtre. And understonde wel, that homicyde, that is
manslaughtre, is in dyverse wyse. Som manere of homicyde is spirituel, and
som is bodily. / Spirituel manslaughtre is in six [604] thinges. First, by
hate; as seint Iohn seith, 'he that hateth his brother is homicyde.' /565
Homicyde is eek by bakbytinge; of whiche bakbyteres seith Salomon, that
'they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hir neighebores.' For soothly,
as wikke is to binime his good name as his lyf. / Homicyde is eek, in
yevinge of wikked conseil by fraude; as for to yeven conseil to areysen
wrongful custumes and taillages. / Of whiche seith Salomon, 'Leon rorynge
and bere hongry been lyke to the cruel lordshipes,' in withholdinge or
abregginge of the shepe (or the hyre), or of the wages of servaunts, or
elles in usure or in withdrawinge of the almesse of povre folk. / For which
the wyse man seith, 'fedeth him that almost dyeth for honger'; for soothly,
but-if thou fede him, thou sleest him; and alle thise been deadly sinnes. /
Bodily manslaughtre is, whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in other
manere; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man, or elles yevest him conseil
to sleen a man. /570 Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres. That oon is
by lawe; right as a Iustice dampneth him that is coupable to the deeth. But
lat the Iustice be war that he do it rightfully, and that he do it nat for
delyt to spille blood, but for kepinge of rightwisenesse. / Another
homicyde is, that is doon for necessitee, as whan o man sleeth another in
his defendaunt, and that he ne may noon otherwise escape from his owene
deeth. / But certeinly, if he may escape withouten manslaughtre of his
adversarie, and sleeth him, he doth sinne, and he shal bere penance as for
deedly sinne. / Eek if a man, by caas or aventure, shete an arwe or caste a
stoon with which he sleeth a man, he is homicyde. / Eek if a womman by
necligence overlyeth hir child in hir sleping, it is homicyde and deedly
sinne. /575 Eek whan man destourbeth concepcion of a child, and maketh a
womman outher bareyne by drinkinge venemouse herbes, thurgh which she may
nat conceyve, or sleeth a child by drinkes wilfully, or elles putteth
certeine material thinges in hir secree places to slee the child; / or
elles doth unkindely sinne, by which man or womman shedeth hir nature in
manere or in place ther-as a child may nat be conceived; or elles, if a
womman have conceyved and hurt hir-self, [605] and sleeth the child, yet is
it homicyde. / What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for
drede of worldly shame? Certes, an horrible homicyde. / Homicyde is eek if
a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherye, thurgh which the child
is perissed, or elles smyteth a womman witingly, thurgh which she leseth
hir child. Alle thise been homicydes and horrible deedly sinnes. / Yet
comen ther of Ire manye mo sinnes, as wel in word as in thoght and in dede;
as he that arretteth upon god, or blameth god, of thing of which he is
him-self gilty; or despyseth god and alle hise halwes, as doon thise
cursede hasardours in diverse contrees. /580 This cursed sinne doon they,
whan they felen in hir hertes ful wikkedly of god and of hise halwes. /
Also, whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter, thilke
sinne is so greet, that unnethe may it been relesed, but that the mercy of
god passeth alle hise werkes; it is so greet and he so benigne. / Thanne
comth of Ire attry angre; whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to
forleten his sinne, / than wole he be angry and answeren hokerly and
angrily, and deffenden or excusen his sinne by unstedefastnesse of his
flesh; or elles he dide it for to holde companye with hise felawes, or
elles, he seith, the fend entyced him; / or elles he dide it for his
youthe, or elles his complexioun is so corageous, that he may nat forbere;
or elles it is his destinee, as he seith, unto a certein age; or elles, he
seith, it cometh him of gentillesse of hise auncestres; and semblable
thinges. /585 Alle this manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir sinnes, that
they ne wol nat delivere hem-self. For soothly, no wight that excuseth him
wilfully of his sinne may nat been delivered of his sinne, til that he
mekely biknoweth his sinne. / After this, thanne cometh swering, that is
expres agayn the comandement of god; and this bifalleth ofte of anger and
of Ire. / God seith: 'thou shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn
or in ydel.' Also oure lord Iesu Crist seith by the word of seint Mathew:
'_Nolite iurare omnino_: / ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere; neither by
hevene, for it is goddes trone; ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his
feet; ne by Ierusalem, for it is the citee of a greet king; ne by thyn
heed, for thou mayst nat make an heer whyt ne blak. / But seyeth by youre
word, "ye, ye," and "nay, nay"; and what [606] that is more, it is of
yvel,' seith Crist. /590 For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so sinfully, in
dismembringe of Crist by soule, herte, bones, and body. For certes, it
semeth that ye thinke that the cursede Iewes ne dismembred nat y-nough the
preciouse persone of Crist, but ye dismembre him more. / And if so be that
the lawe compelle yow to swere, thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in
youre swering, as seith Ieremye _quarto capitulo_, '_Iurabis in veritate,
in iudido et in iustida_: thou shalt kepe three condicions; thou shalt
swere in trouthe, in doom, and in rightwisnesse.' / This is to seyn, thou
shalt swere sooth; for every lesinge is agayns Crist. For Crist is verray
trouthe. And think wel this, that every greet swerere, nat compelled
lawefully to swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his hous whyl he useth
swich unleveful swering. / Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art
constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe. / Eek thou shalt nat
swere for envye ne for favour, ne for mede, but for rightwisnesse; for
declaracioun of it to the worship of god and helping of thyne
evene-cristene. /595 And therfore, every man that taketh goddes name in
ydel, or falsly swereth with his mouth, or elles taketh on him the name of
Crist, to be called a Cristene man, and liveth agayns Cristes livinge and
his techinge, alle they taken goddes name in ydel. / Loke eek what seint
Peter seith, _Actuum quarto capitulo_, '_Non est aliud nomen sub celo_,'
&c. 'Ther nis noon other name,' seith seint Peter, 'under hevene, yeven to
men, in which they mowe be saved;' that is to seyn, but the name of Iesu
Crist. / Take kepe eek how that the precious name of Crist, as seith seint
Paul _ad Philipenses secundo_, '_In nomine Iesu_, &c.: that in the name of
Iesu every knee of hevenely creatures, or erthely, or of helle sholden
bowe'; for it is so heigh and so worshipful, that the cursede feend in
helle sholde tremblen to heren it y-nempned. / Thanne semeth it, that men
that sweren so horribly by his blessed name, that they despyse him more
boldely than dide the cursede Iewes, or elles the devel, that trembleth

milk of losengerie. / For sothe, Salomon seith, that 'flaterie is wors than
detraccioun.' For som-tyme detraccion maketh an hautein man be the more
humble, for he dredeth detraccion; but certes flaterye, that maketh a man
to enhauncen his herte and his contenaunce. / Flatereres been the develes
enchauntours; for they make a man to wene of him-self be lyk that he nis
nat lyk. /615 They been lyk to Iudas that bitraysed [god; and thise
flatereres bitraysen] a man to sellen him to his enemy, that is, to the
devel. / Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that singen evere
_Placebo_. / I rekene flaterye in the vyces of Ire; for ofte tyme, if o man

§ 41. Speke we now of swich cursinge as comth of irous herte. Malisoun
generally may be seyd every maner power or harm. Swich cursinge bireveth
man fro the regne of god, as seith seint Paul. / And ofte tyme swich
cursinge wrongfully retorneth agayn to him that curseth, as a brid that
retorneth agayn to his owene nest. /620 And over alle thing men oghten
eschewe to cursen hir children, and yeven to the devel hir engendrure, as
ferforth as in hem is; certes, it is greet peril and greet sinne. /

§ 42. Lat us thanne speken of chydinge and reproche, whiche been ful grete
woundes in mannes herte; for they unsowen the semes of frendshipe in mannes
herte. / For certes, unnethes may a man pleynly been accorded with him that
hath him openly revyled and repreved in disclaundre. This is a ful grisly
sinne, as Crist seith in the gospel. / And tak kepe now, that he that
repreveth his neighebor, outher he repreveth him by som harm of peyne that
he hath on his body, as 'mesel,' 'croked harlot,' or by som sinne that he
dooth. / Now if he repreve him by harm of peyne, thanne turneth the repreve
to Iesu Crist; for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of god, and by his
suffrance, be it meselrie, or maheym, or maladye. /625 And if he repreve
him uncharitably of sinne, as, 'thou holour,' 'thou dronkelewe harlot,' and
so forth; thanne aperteneth that to the reioysinge of the devel, that evere
hath Ioye that men doon sinne. / And certes, chydinge may nat come but out
of a vileyns herte. For after the habundance of the herte speketh the mouth
ful ofte. / And ye shul understonde [609] that loke, by any wey, whan any
man shal chastyse another, that he be war from chydinge or reprevinge. For
trewely, but he be war, he may ful lightly quiken the fyr of angre and of
wratthe, which that he sholde quenche, and per-aventure sleeth him which
that he mighte chastyse with benignitee. / For as seith Salomon, 'the
amiable tonge is the tree of lyf,' that is to seyn, of lyf espirituel: and
sothly, a deslavee tonge sleeth the spirites of him that repreveth, and eek
of him that is repreved. / Lo, what seith seint Augustin: 'ther is no-thing
so lyk the develes child as he that ofte chydeth.' Seint Paul seith eek:
'I, servant of god, bihove nat to chyde.' /630 And how that chydinge be a
vileyns thing bitwixe alle manere folk, yet it is certes most uncovenable
bitwixe a man and his wyf; for there is nevere reste. And therfore seith
Salomon, 'an hous that is uncovered and droppinge, and a chydinge wyf, been
lyke.' / A man that is in a droppinge hous in many places, though he
eschewe the droppinge in o place, it droppeth on him in another place; so
fareth it by a chydinge wyf. But she chyde him in o place, she wol chyde
him in another. / And therfore, 'bettre is a morsel of breed with Ioye than
an hous ful of delyces, with chydinge,' seith Salomon. / Seint Paul seith:
'O ye wommen, be ye subgetes to youre housbondes as bihoveth in god; and ye
men, loveth youre wyves.' _Ad Colossenses, tertio_. /

whan he scorneth a man for hise gode werkes. /635 For certes, swiche
scorneres faren lyk the foule tode, that may nat endure to smelle the sote
savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth. / Thise scorneres been parting

in him-self, that he that wole anoye another man, he anoyeth first

SEQUITUR REMEDIUM CONTRA PECCATUM IRE.

§ 48. The remedye agayns Ire is a vertu that men clepen Mansuetude, that is
Debonairetee; and eek another vertu, that men callen Pacience or Suffrance.
/

    654. Cm. (_only_) that Ihon de Bonania clepith debonayretee.

§ 49. Debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the stiringes and the
moevynges of mannes corage in his herte, in swich manere that they ne
skippe nat out by angre ne by Ire. /655 Suffrance suffreth swetely alle the
anoyaunces and the wronges that men doon to man outward. / Seint Ierome
seith thus of debonairetee, that 'it doth noon harm to no wight, ne seith;
ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn, he ne eschaufeth nat agayns, his
resoun.' / This vertu som-tyme comth of nature; for, as seith the
philosophre, 'a man is a quik thing, by nature debonaire and tretable to
goodnesse; but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace, thanne is it the
more worth.' /

§ 50. Pacience, that is another remedye agayns Ire, is a vertu that
suffreth swetely every mannes goodnesse, and is nat wrooth for noon harm
that is doon to him. / The philosophre seith, that 'pacience is thilke
vertu that suffreth debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every
wikked word.' /660 This vertu maketh a man lyk to god, and maketh him
goddes owene dere child, as seith Crist. This vertu disconfiteth thyn
enemy. And therfore seith the wyse man, 'if thou wolt venquisse thyn enemy,
lerne to suffre.' / And thou shalt understonde, that man suffreth foure
manere of grevances in outward thinges, agayns the whiche foure he moot
have foure manere of paciences. /

    659. E. Ln. it is a; _rest_ is a.

§ 51. The firste grevance is of wikkede wordes; thilke suffrede Iesu Crist
with-outen grucching, ful paciently, whan the Iewes despysed and repreved
him ful ofte. / Suffre thou therfore paciently; for the wyse man seith: 'if
thou stryve with a [612] fool, though the fool be wrooth or though he
laughe, algate thou shalt have no reste.' / That other grevance outward is
to have damage of thy catel. Ther-agayns suffred Crist ful paciently, whan
he was despoyled of al that he hadde in this lyf, and that nas but hise
clothes. /665 The thridde grevance is a man to have harm in his body. That
suffred Crist ful paciently in al his passioun. / The fourthe grevance is
in outrageous labour in werkes. Wherfore I seye, that folk that maken hir
servants to travaillen to grevously, or out of tyme, as on halydayes,
soothly they do greet sinne. / Heer-agayns suffred Crist ful paciently, and
taughte us pacience, whan he bar up-on his blissed shulder the croys, up-on
which he sholde suffren despitous deeth. / Heer may men lerne to be
pacient; for certes, noght only Cristen men been pacient for love of Iesu
Crist, and for guerdoun of the blisful lyf that is perdurable; but certes,

Pacience comth Obedience, thurgh which a man is obedient to Crist and to
alle hem to whiche he oghte to been obedient in Crist. / And understond wel
that obedience is perfit, whan that a man doth gladly and hastily, with
good herte entierly, al that he sholde do. /675 Obedience generally, is to

SEQUITUR DE ACCIDIA.

§ 53. After the sinnes of Envie and of Ire, now wol I speken of the sinne
of Accidie. For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, [613] and Ire troubleth
a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. / Envye and Ire
maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of Accidie, and
binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse. Thanne is Accidie the anguissh of
a trouble herte; and seint Augustin seith: 'it is anoy of goodnesse and
Ioye of harm.' / Certes, this is a dampnable sinne; for it doth wrong to
Iesu Crist, in-as-muche as it binimeth the service that men oghte doon to
Crist with alle diligence, as seith Salomon. / But Accidie dooth no swich
diligence; he dooth alle thing with anoy, and with wrawnesse, slaknesse,
and excusacioun, and with ydelnesse and unlust; for which the book seith:
'acursed be he that doth the service of god necligently.' /680 Thanne is
Accidie enemy to everich estaat of man; for certes, the estaat of man is in
three maneres. / Outher it is thestaat of innocence, as was thestaat of
Adam biforn that he fil into sinne; in which estaat he was holden to
wirche, as in heryinge and adouringe of god. / Another estaat is the estaat
of sinful men, in which estaat men been holden to laboure in preyinge to
god for amendement of hir sinnes, and that he wole graunte hem to arysen
out of hir sinnes. / Another estaat is thestaat of grace, in which estaat
he is holden to werkes of penitence; and certes, to alle thise thinges is
Accidie enemy and contrarie. For he loveth no bisinesse at al. / Now
certes, this foule sinne Accidie is eek a ful greet enemy to the lyflode of
the body; for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporel necessitee; for it
forsleweth and forsluggeth, and destroyeth alle goodes tem-poreles by
reccheleesnesse. /685

been dampned been so bounde, that they ne may neither wel do ne wel thinke.
/ Of Accidie comth first, that a man is anoyed and encombred for to doon
any goodnesse, and maketh that god hath abhominacion of swich Accidie, as
seith seint Iohan. /

    687. E. _om._ as ... Iohan.

§ 55. Now comth Slouthe, that wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne no penaunce.
For soothly, Slouthe is so tendre, and so delicat, as seith Salomon, that
he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce, and therfore he shendeth al
that he dooth. / Agayns [614] this roten-herted sinne of Accidie and
Slouthe sholde men exercise hem-self to doon gode werkes, and manly and
vertuously cacchen corage wel to doon; thinkinge that oure lord Iesu Crist
quyteth every good dede, be it never so lyte. / Usage of labour is a greet
thing; for it maketh, as seith seint Bernard, the laborer to have stronge
armes and harde sinwes; and Slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre. /690
Thanne comth drede to biginne to werke any gode werkes; for certes, he that
is enclyned to sinne, him thinketh it is so greet an empryse for to
undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse, / and casteth in his herte that the
circumstaunces of goodnesse been so grevouse and so chargeaunt for to
suffre, that he dar nat undertake to do werkes of goodnesse, as seith seint
Gregorie. /

§ 56. Now comth wanhope, that is despeir of the mercy of god, that comth
somtyme of to muche outrageous sorwe, and somtyme of to muche drede;
imagininge that he hath doon so muche sinne, that it wol nat availlen him,
though he wolde repenten him and forsake sinne: / thurgh which despeir or
drede he abaundoneth al his herte to every maner sinne, as seith seint
Augustin. / Which dampnable sinne, if that it continue un-to his ende, it
is cleped sinning in the holy gost. /695 This horrible sinne is so
perilous, that he that is despeired, ther nis no felonye ne no sinne that
he douteth for to do; as shewed wel by Iudas. / Certes, aboven alle sinnes
thanne is this sinne most displesant to Crist, and most adversarie. /
Soothly, he that despeireth him is lyk the coward champioun recreant, that
seith creant withoute nede. Allas! allas! nedeles is he recreant and
nedeles despeired. / Certes, the mercy of god is evere redy to every
penitent, and is aboven alle hise werkes. / Allas! can nat a man bithinke
him on the gospel of seint Luk, 15., where-as Crist seith that 'as wel shal
ther be Ioye in hevene upon a sinful man that doth penitence, as up-on
nynety and nyne rightful men that neden no penitence?' /700 Loke forther,
in the same gospel, the Ioye and the feste of the gode man that hadde lost
his sone, whan his sone with repentaunce was retourned to his fader. / Can
they nat remembren hem eek, that, as seith seint Luk _xxiii_º _capitulo_,
how that the theef that was hanged [615] bisyde Iesu Crist, seyde: 'Lord,
remembre of me, whan thou comest in-to thy regne?' / 'For sothe,' seyde
Crist, 'I seye to thee, to-day shaltow been with me in Paradys.' / Certes,
ther is noon so horrible sinne of man, that it ne may, in his lyf, be
destroyed by penitence, thurgh vertu of the passion and of the deeth of
Crist. / Allas! what nedeth man thanne to been despeired, sith that his
mercy so redy is and large? Axe and have. /705 Thanne cometh Sompnolence,
that is, sluggy slombringe, which maketh a man be hevy and dul, in body and
in soule; and this sinne comth of Slouthe. / And certes, the tyme that, by
wey of resoun, men sholde nat slepe, that is by the morwe; but-if ther were
cause resonable. / For soothly, the morwe-tyde is most covenable, a man to

REMEDIUM CONTRA PECCATUM ACCIDIE.

§ 60. Agayns this horrible sinne of Accidie, and the branches of the same,
ther is a vertu that is called _Fortitudo_ or Strengthe; that is, an
affeccioun thurgh which a man despyseth anoyous thinges. / This vertu is so
mighty and so vigorous, that it dar withstonde mightily and wysely kepen
him-self fro perils that been wikked, and wrastle agayn the assautes of the

that is to seyn, greet corage. For certes, ther bihoveth greet corage
agains Accidie, lest that it ne swolwe the soule by the sinne of sorwe, or
destroye it by wanhope. / This vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thinges
and grevouse thinges, by hir owene wil, wysely and resonably. / And for as
muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man more by queyntise and by sleighte
than by strengthe, therfore men shal withstonden him by wit and by resoun
and by discrecioun. / Thanne arn ther the vertues of feith, and hope in god
and in hise seintes, to acheve and acomplice the gode werkes in the whiche
he purposeth fermely to continue. / Thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse;
and that is, whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme cominge of the gode
werkes that a man hath bigonne. /735 Thanne comth Magnificence, that is to
seyn, whan a man dooth and perfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse that he
hath bigonne; and that is the ende why that men sholde do gode werkes; for
in the acomplissinge of grete goode werkes lyth the grete guerdoun. /
Thanne is ther Constaunce, that is, stablenesse of corage; and this sholde

SEQUITUR DE AUARICIA.

§ 62. After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice and of Coveitise, of which sinne
seith seint Paule, that 'the rote of alle harmes is Coveitise': _Ad
Timotheum, sexto capitulo_. / For soothly, whan the herte of a man is
confounded in it-self and troubled, and that the soule hath lost the
confort of god, thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thinges. /740

    739. Pt. _Capitulo_; _rest om._

§ 63. Avarice, after the descripcion of seint Augustin, is likerousnesse in
herte to have erthely thinges. / Som other folk seyn, that Avarice is, for
to purchacen manye erthely thinges, and nothing yeve to hem that han nede.
/ And understond, that Avarice ne stant nat only in lond ne catel, but
somtyme in science [618] and in glorie, and in every manere of outrageous
thing is Avarice and Coveitise. / And the difference bitwixe Avarice and
Coveitise is this. Coveitise is for to coveite swiche thinges as thou hast
nat; and Avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thinges as thou hast,
with-oute rightful nede. / Soothly, this Avarice is a sinne that is ful
dampnable; for al holy writ curseth it, and speketh agayns that vyce; for
it dooth wrong to Iesu Crist. /745 For it bireveth him the love that men to
him owen, and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun; / and maketh that the
avaricious man hath more hope in his catel than in Iesu Crist, and dooth
more observance in kepinge of his tresor than he dooth to service of Iesu
Crist. / And therfore seith seint Paul _ad Ephesios, quinto_, that 'an
avaricious man is in the thraldom of ydolatrie.' /

    743. E. vnderstoond.   748. E. Hl. _om._ in _after_ is; Pt. hath more
    hope in his thraldome; Ln. is thral. _No_ MS. _has the precise reading
    given; but it is clear that_ in _has been dropped_.

§ 64. What difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an avaricious man, but
that an ydolastre, per aventure, ne hath but o mawmet or two, and the
avaricious man hath manye? For certes, every florin in his cofre is his
mawmet. / And certes, the sinne of Mawmetrye is the firste thing that God
deffended in the ten comaundments, as bereth witnesse _Exodi, capitulo
xx_º: /750 'Thou shall have no false goddes bifore me, ne thou shall make
to thee no grave thing.' Thus is an avaricious man, that loveth his tresor
biforn god, an ydolastre, / thurgh this cursed sinne of Avarice. Of
Coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes, thurgh whiche men been distreyned
by tailages, custumes, and cariages, more than hir duetee or resoun is. And
eek they taken of hir bonde-men amerciments, whiche mighten more resonably
ben cleped extorcions than amerciments. / Of whiche amerciments and
raunsoninge of bondemen, somme lordes stywardes seyn, that it is rightful;
for-as-muche as a cherl hath no temporel thing that it ne is his lordes, as
they seyn. / But certes, thise lordshipes doon wrong, that bireven hir
bonde-folk thinges that they nevere yave hem: _Augustinus de Civitate,
libro nono_. / Sooth is, that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste
cause of thraldom is for sinne; _Genesis, quinto_. /755

§ 65. Thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom, but nat nature. /
Wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifyen hem in hir lordshipes,
sith that by naturel condicion they been nat [619] lordes of thralles; but
for that thraldom comth first by the desert of sinne. / And forther-over,
ther-as the lawe seith, that temporel godes of bonde-folk been the godes of
hir lordshipes, ye, that is for to understonde, the godes of the emperour,
to deffenden hem in hir right, but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem. /
And therfore seith Seneca: 'thy prudence sholde live benignely with thy
thralles.' / Thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple; for
humble folk been Cristes freendes; they been contubernial with the lord.

§ 66. Think eek, that of swich seed as cherles springeth, of swich seed
springen lordes. As wel may the cherl be saved as the lord. / The same
deeth that taketh the cherl, swich deeth taketh the lord. Wherfore I rede,
do right so with thy cherl, as thou woldest that thy lord dide with thee,
if thou were in his plyt. / Every sinful man is a cherl to sinne. I rede
thee, certes, that thou, lord, werke in swiche wyse with thy cherles, that
they rather love thee than drede. / I woot wel ther is degree above degree,
as reson is; and skile it is, that men do hir devoir ther-as it is due; but
certes, extorcions and despit of youre underlinges is dampnable. /

§ 67. And forther-over understand wel, that thise conquerours or tiraunts
maken ful ofte thralles of hem, that been born of as royal blood as been
they that hem conqueren. /765 This name of thraldom was nevere erst couth,
til that Noe seyde, that his sone Canaan sholde be thral to hise bretheren
for his sinne. / What seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions
to holy chirche? Certes, the swerd, that men yeven first to a knight whan
he is newe dubbed, signifyeth that he sholde deffenden holy chirche, and
nat robben it ne pilen it; and who so dooth, is traitour to Crist. / And,
as seith seint Augustin, 'they been the develes wolves, that stranglen the
sheep of Iesu Crist'; and doon worse than wolves. / For soothly, whan the
wolf hath ful his wombe, he stinteth to strangle sheep. But soothly, the
pilours and destroyours of goddes holy chirche ne do nat so; for they ne
stinte nevere to pile. / Now, as I have seyd, sith so is that sinne was
first cause of thraldom, thanne is it thus; that thilke tyme that al this
world was in sinne, thanne was al this world in thraldom and subieccioun.
/770 But certes, sith the tyme of grace cam, god ordeyned that som folk
sholde be more heigh [620] in estaat and in degree, and som folk more lowe,
and that everich sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree. / And
therfore, in somme contrees ther they byen thralles, whan they han turned
hem to the feith, they maken hir thralles free out of thraldom. And
therfore, certes, the lord oweth to his man that the man oweth to his lord.
/ The Pope calleth him-self servant of the servaunts of god; but
for-as-muche as the estaat of holy chirche ne mighte nat han be, ne the
commune profit mighte nat han be kept, ne pees and reste in erthe, but-if
god hadde ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men lower: /
therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned to kepe and mayntene and deffenden hir
underlinges or hir subgets in resoun, as ferforth as it lyth in hir power;
and nat to destroyen hem ne confounde. / Wherfore I seye, that thilke
lordes that been lyk wolves, that devouren the possessiouns or the catel of
povre folk wrongfully, with-outen mercy or mesure, /775 they shul receyven,
by the same mesure that they han mesured to povre folk, the mercy of Iesu
Crist, but-if it be amended. / Now comth deceite bitwixe marchant and
marchant. And thow shalt understonde, that marchandyse is in two maneres;
that oon is bodily, and that other is goostly. That oon is honeste and
leveful, and that other is deshoneste and unleveful. / Of thilke bodily
marchandyse, that is leveful and honeste, is this; that, there-as god hath
ordeyned that a regne or a contree is suffisaunt to him-self, thanne is it
honeste and leveful, that of habundaunce of this contree, that men helpe
another contree that is more nedy. / And therfore, ther mote been marchants
to bringen fro that o contree to that other hire marchandyses. / That other
marchandise, that men haunten with fraude and trecherie and deceite, with
lesinges and false othes, is cursed and dampnable.  /780 Espirituel
marchandyse is proprely Symonye, that is, ententif desyr to byen thing
espirituel, that is, thing that aperteneth to the seintuarie of god and to
cure of the soule. / This desyr, if so be that a man do his diligence to
parfournen it, al-be-it that his desyr ne take noon effect, yet is it to
him a deedly sinne; and if he be ordred, he is irreguler. / Certes, Symonye
is cleped of Symon Magus, that wolde han boght, for temporel catel, the
yifte that god hadde yeven, by the holy goost, to seint Peter and to [621]
the apostles. / And therfore understond, that bothe he that selleth and he
that byeth thinges espirituels, been cleped Symonials; be it by catel, be
it by procuringe, or by fleshly preyere of hise freendes, fleshly freendes,
or espirituel freendes. / Fleshly, in two maneres; as by kinrede or othere
freendes. Soothly, if they praye for him that is nat worthy and able, it is
Symonye if he take the benefice; and if he be worthy and able, ther nis
noon. /785 That other manere is, whan a man or womman preyen for folk to
avauncen hem, only for wikked fleshly affeccioun that they have un-to the
persone; and that is foul Symonye. / But certes, in service, for which men
yeven thinges espirituels un-to hir servants, it moot been understonde that
the service moot been honeste, and elles nat; and eek that it be with-outen
bargayninge, and that the persone be able. / For, as seith Seint Damasie,
'alle the sinnes of the world, at regard of this sinne, am as thing of
noght'; for it is the gretteste sinne that may be, after the sinne of
Lucifer and Antecrist. / For, by this sinne, god forleseth the chirche, and
the soule that he boghte with his precious blood, by hem that yeven
chirches to hem that been nat digne. / For they putten in theves, that
stelen the soules of Iesu Christ and destroyen his patrimoine. /790 By
swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the lasse reverence of
the sacraments of holy chirche; and swiche yeveres of chirches putten out
the children of Crist, and putten in-to the chirche the develes owene sone.
/ They sellen the soules that lambes sholde kepen to the wolf that
strangleth hem. And therfore shul they nevere han part of the pasture of
lambes, that is, the blisse of hevene. / Now comth hasardrye with hise
apurtenaunces, as tables and rafles; of which comth deceite, false othes,
chydinges, and alle ravines, blaspheminge and reneyinge of god, and hate of
hise neighebores, wast of godes, misspendinge of tyme, and somtyme
manslaughtre. / Certes, hasardours ne mowe nat been with-outen greet sinne
whyles they haunte that craft. / Of avarice comen eek lesinges, thefte,
fals witnesse, and false othes. And ye shul understonde that thise been
grete sinnes, and expres agayn the comaundements of god, as I have seyd.
/795 Fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede. In word, as for to bireve
thy neighebores goode name by thy fals witnessing, or [622] bireven him his
catel or his heritage by thy fals witnessing; whan thou, for ire or for
mede, or for envye, berest fals witnesse, or accusest him or excusest him
by thy fals witnesse, or elles excusest thy-self falsly. / Ware yow,
questemongeres and notaries! Certes, for fals witnessing was Susanna in ful
gret sorwe and peyne, and many another mo. / The sinne of thefte is eek
expres agayns goddes heste, and that in two maneres, corporel and
espirituel. / Corporel, as for to take thy neighebores catel agayn his wil,
be it by force or by sleighte, be it by met or by mesure. / By steling eek
of false enditements upon him, and in borwinge of thy neighebores catel, in
entente nevere to payen it agayn, and semblable thinges. /800 Espirituel
thefte is Sacrilege, that is to seyn, hurtinge of holy thinges, or of
thinges sacred to Crist, in two maneres; by reson of the holy place, as
chirches or chirche-hawes, / for which every vileyns sinne that men doon in
swiche places may be cleped sacrilege, or every violence in the semblable
places. Also, they that withdrawen falsly the rightes that longen to holy
chirche. / And pleynly and generally, sacrilege is to reven holy thing fro
holy place, or unholy thing out of holy place, or holy thing out of unholy

RELEVACIO CONTRA PECCATUM AVARICIE.

§ 68. Now shul ye understonde, that the relevinge of Avarice is
misericorde, and pitee largely taken. And men mighten axe, why that
misericorde and pitee is relevinge of Avarice? / Certes, the avaricious man
sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the nedeful man; for he delyteth him in
the kepinge of his tresor, and nat in the rescowinge ne relevinge of his
evene-cristene. And therfore fore speke I first of misericorde. /805 Thanne
is misericorde, as seith the philosophre, a vertu, by which the corage of
man is stired by the misese of him that is misesed. / Up-on which
misericorde folweth pitee, in parfourninge of charitable werkes of
misericorde. / And certes, thise thinges moeven a man to misericorde of
Iesu Crist, that he yaf him-self for oure gilt, and suffred deeth for
misericorde, and forgaf us oure originale sinnes; / and therby relessed us
fro the peynes of helle, and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by
penitence, and yeveth grace wel to do, and atte laste [623] the blisse of
hevene. / The speces of misericorde been, as for to lene and for to yeve
and to foryeven and relesse, and for to han pitee in herte, and compassioun
of the meschief of his evene-cristene, and eek to chastyse there as nede
is. /810 Another manere of remedie agayns Avarice is resonable largesse;
but soothly, here bihoveth the consideracioun of the grace of Iesu Crist,
and of hise temporel goodes, and eek of the godes perdurables that Crist
yaf to us; / and to han remembrance of the deeth that he shal receyve, he
noot whanne, where, ne how; and eek that he shal forgon al that he hath,

elles to doon y-nogh to the unmesurable appetyt and desordeynce coveityse
to eten or to drinke. / This sinne corrumped al this world, as is wel
shewed in the sinne of Adam and of Eve. Loke eek, what seith seint Paul of
Glotonye. / 'Manye,' seith seint Paul, 'goon, of whiche I have ofte seyd to
yow, and now I seye it wepinge, that they been the enemys of the croys of
Crist; of whiche the ende is deeth, and of whiche hir wombe is hir god, and

that is usaunt to this sinne of Glotonye, he ne may no sinne withstonde. He
moot been in servage of alle vyces, for it is the develes hord ther he
hydeth him and resteth. / This [624] sinne hath manye speces. The firste is
dronkenesse, that is the horrible sepulture of mannes resoun; and therfore,
whan a man is dronken, he hath lost his resoun; and this is deedly sinne. /
But soothly, whan that a man is nat wont to strong drinke, and peraventure
ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the drinke, or hath feblesse in his heed,
or hath travailed, thurgh which he drinketh the more, al be he sodeynly
caught with drinke, it is no deedly sinne, but venial. / The seconde spece
of Glotonye is, that the spirit of a man wexeth al trouble; for dronkenesse
bireveth him the discrecioun of his wit. / The thridde spece of Glotonye
is, whan a man devoureth his mete, and hath no rightful manere of etinge.
/825 The fourthe is whan, thurgh the grete habundaunce of his mete, the
humours in his body been destempred. / The fifthe is, foryetelnesse by to

§ 72. Agayns Glotonye is the remedie Abstinence, as seith Galien; but that
holde I nat meritorie, if he do it only for the hele of his body. Seint
Augustin wole, that Abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience. /
Abstinence, he seith, is litel worth, but if a man have good wil ther-to,
and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee, and that men doon it
for godes sake, and in hope to have the blisse of hevene. /

§ 73. The felawes of Abstinence been Attemperaunce, that holdeth the mene
in alle thinges: eek Shame, that eschueth alle deshonestee: Suffisance,
that seketh no riche metes ne drinkes, ne dooth no fors of to outrageous
apparailinge of mete. / Mesure also, that restreyneth by resoun the
deslavee appetyt of etinge: [625] Sobrenesse also, that restreyneth the
outrage of drinke: / Sparinge also, that restreyneth the delicat ese to
sitte longe at his mete and softely; wherfore som folk stonden of hir owene
wil, to eten at the lasse leyser. /835

SEQUITUR DE LUXURIA.

§ 74. After Glotonye, thanne comth Lecherie; for thise two sinnes been so
ny cosins, that ofte tyme they wol nat departe. / God woot, this sinne is
ful displesaunt thing to god; for he seyde himself, 'do no lecherie.' And
therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this sinne in the olde lawe. / If
womman thral were taken in this sinne, she sholde be beten with staves to
the deeth. And if she were a gentil womman, she sholde be slayn with
stones. And if she were a bisshoppes doghter, she sholde been brent, by
goddes comandement. / Forther over, by the sinne of Lecherie, god dreynte
al the world at the diluge. And after that, he brente fyve citees with
thonder-leyt, and sank hem in-to helle. /

§ 75. Now lat us speke thanne of thilke stinkinge sinne of Lecherie that
men clepe Avoutrie of wedded folk, that is to seyn, if that oon of hem be
wedded, or elles bothe. /840 Seint Iohn seith, that avoutiers shullen been
in helle in a stank brenninge of fyr and of brimston; in fyr, for the
lecherie; in brimston, for the stink of hir ordure. / Certes, the brekinge
of this sacrement is an horrible thing; it was maked of god him-self in
paradys, and confermed by Iesu Crist, as witnesseth seint Mathew in the
gospel: 'A man shal lete fader and moder, and taken him to his wyf, and
they shullen be two in o flesh.' / This sacrement bitokneth the knittinge
togidre of Crist and of holy chirche. / And nat only that god forbad
avoutrie in dede, but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy
neighebores wyf. / In this heeste, seith seint Augustin, is forboden alle
manere coveitise to doon lecherie. Lo what seith seint Mathew in the
gospel: that 'who-so seeth a womman to coveitise of his lust, he hath doon
lecherie with hir in his herte.' /845 Here may ye seen that nat only the
dede of this sinne is forboden, but eek the desyr to doon that sinne. /
This cursed sinne anoyeth grevousliche [626] hem that it haunten. And
first, to hir soule; for he oblygeth it to sinne and to peyne of deeth that
is perdurable. / Un-to the body anoyeth it grevously also, for it dreyeth
him, and wasteth, and shent him, and of his blood he maketh sacrifyce to
the feend of helle; it wasteth his catel and his substaunce. / And certes,
if it be a foul thing, a man to waste his catel on wommen, yet is it a
fouler thing whan that, for swich ordure, wommen dispenden up-on men hir
catel and substaunce. / This sinne, as seith the prophete, bireveth man and
womman hir gode fame, and al hir honour; and it is ful pleasaunt to the
devel; for ther-by winneth he the moste partie of this world. /850 And
right as a marchant delyteth him most in chaffare that he hath most
avantage of, right so delyteth the feend in this ordure. /

§ 76. This is that other hand of the devel, with fyve fingres, to cacche
the peple to his vileinye. / The firste finger is the fool lookinge of the
fool womman and of the fool man, that sleeth, right as the basilicok sleeth
folk by the venim of his sighte; for the coveitise of eyen folweth the
coveitise of the herte. / The seconde finger is the vileyns touchinge in
wikkede manere; and ther-fore seith Salomon, that who-so toucheth and
handleth a womman, he fareth lyk him that handleth the scorpioun that
stingeth and sodeynly sleeth thurgh his enveniminge; as who-so toucheth
warm pich, it shent hise fingres. / The thridde, is foule wordes, that
fareth lyk fyr, that right anon brenneth the herte. /855 The fourthe finger
is the kissinge; and trewely he were a greet fool that wolde kisse the
mouth of a brenninge ovene or of a fourneys. / And more fooles been they
that kissen in vileinye; for that mouth is the mouth of helle: and namely,
thise olde dotardes holours, yet wol they kisse, though they may nat do,
and smatre hem. / Certes, they been lyk to houndes; for an hound, whan he
comth by the roser or by othere [busshes], though he may nat pisse, yet
wole he heve up his leg and make a contenaunce to pisse. / And for that
many man weneth that he may nat sinne, for no likerousnesse that he doth
with his wyf; certes, that opinion is fals. God woot, a man may sleen
him-self with his owene knyf, and make him-selven dronken of his owene
tonne. / Certes, be it wyf, be it child, or any worldly thing that he
loveth [627] biforn god, it is his maumet, and he is an ydolastre. /860 Man
sholde loven his wyf by discrecioun, paciently and atemprely; and thanne is
she as though it were his suster. / The fifthe finger of the develes hand
is the stinkinge dede of Lecherie. / Certes, the fyve fingres of Glotonie
the feend put in the wombe of a man, and with hise fyve fyngres of Lecherie
he gripeth him by the reynes, for to throwen him in-to the fourneys of
helle; / ther-as they shul han the fyr and the wormes that evere shul
lasten, and wepinge and wailinge, sharp hunger and thurst, and grimnesse of
develes that shullen al to-trede hem, with-outen respit and withouten ende.
/ Of Lecherie, as I seyde, sourden diverse speces; as fornicacioun, that is
bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried; and this is deedly sinne and
agayns nature. /865 Al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is agayns
nature. / Parfay, the resoun of a man telleth eek him wel that it is deedly
sinne, for-as-muche as god forbad Lecherie. And seint Paul yeveth hem the
regne, that nis dewe to no wight but to hem that doon deedly sinne. /
Another sinne of Lecherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede; for he
that so dooth, certes, he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste degree that is
in this present lyf, / and bireveth hir thilke precious fruit that the book
clepeth 'the hundred fruit.' I ne can seye it noon other weyes in English,
but in Latin it highte _Centesimus fructus_. / Certes, he that so dooth is
cause of manye damages and vileinyes, mo than any man can rekene; right as
he som-tyme is cause of alle damages that bestes don in the feeld, that
breketh the hegge or the closure; thurgh which he destroyeth that may nat
been restored. /870 For certes, na-more may maydenhede be restored than an
arm that is smiten fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe. / She may have
mercy, this woot I wel, if she do penitence; but nevere shal it be that she
nas corrupt. / And al-be-it so that I have spoken somwhat of Avoutrie, it
is good to shewen mo perils that longen to Avoutrie, for to eschue that
foule sinne. / Avoutrie in Latin is for to seyn, approchinge of other
mannes bed, thurgh which tho that whylom weren o flessh abaundone hir
bodyes to othere persones. / Of this sinne, as seith the wyse man, folwen
manye harmes. First, brekinge of feith; and certes, in feith is the keye of
Cristendom. /875 And whan that feith is broken and lorn, soothly Cristendom
stant [628] veyn and with-outen fruit. / This sinne is eek a thefte; for
thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thing agayns his wille. /
Certes, this is the fouleste thefte that may be, whan a womman steleth hir
body from hir housbonde and yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen hir; and
steleth hir soule fro Crist, and yeveth it to the devel. / This is a fouler
thefte, than for to breke a chirche and stele the chalice; for thise
Avoutiers breken the temple of god spiritually, and stelen the vessel of
grace, that is, the body and the soule, for which Crist shal destroyen hem,
as seith Seint Paul. / Soothly of this thefte douted gretly Joseph, whan
that his lordes wyf preyed him of vileinye, whan he seyde, 'lo, my lady,
how my lord hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world;
ne no-thing of hise thinges is out of my power, but only ye that been his
wyf. /880 And how sholde I thanne do this wikkednesse, and sinne so
horribly agayns god, and agayns my lord? God it forbede.' Allas! al to
litel is swich trouthe now y-founde! / The thridde harm is the filthe
thurgh which they breken the comandement of god, and defoulen the auctour
of matrimoine, that is Crist. / For certes, in-so-muche as the sacrement of
mariage is so noble and so digne, so muche is it gretter sinne for to
breken it; for god made mariage in paradys, in the estaat of Innocence, to
multiplye man-kinde to the service of god. / And therfore is the brekinge
ther-of more grevous. Of which brekinge comen false heires ofte tyme, that
wrongfully occupyen folkes heritages. And therfore wol Crist putte hem out
of the regne of hevene, that is heritage to gode folk. / Of this brekinge
comth eek ofte tyme, that folk unwar wedden or sinnen with hir owene
kinrede; and namely thilke harlottes that haunten bordels of thise fool
wommen, that mowe be lykned to a commune gonge, where-as men purgen hir
ordure. /885 What seye we eek of putours that liven by the horrible sinne
of putrie, and constreyne wommen to yelden to hem a certeyn rente of hir
bodily puterie, ye, somtyme of his owene wyf or his child; as doon this
baudes? Certes, thise been cursede sinnes. / Understond eek, that avoutrie
is set gladly in the ten comandements bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre; for
it is the gretteste thefte that may be; for it is thefte of body and of
soule. / And it is lyk to homicyde; for it kerveth a-two and [629] breketh
a-two hem that first were maked o flesh, and therfore, by the olde lawe of
god, they sholde be slayn. / But nathelees, by the lawe of Iesu Crist, that
is lawe of pitee, whan he seyde to the womman that was founden in avoutrie,
and sholde han been slayn with stones, after the wil of the Iewes, as was
hir lawe: 'Go,' quod Iesu Crist, 'and have na-more wil to sinne'; or,
'wille na-more to do sinne.' / Soothly, the vengeaunce of avoutrie is
awarded to the peynes of helle, but-if so be that it be destourbed by
penitence. /890 Yet been ther mo speces of this cursed sinne; as whan that
oon of hem is religious, or elles bothe; or of folk that been entred in-to
ordre, as subdekne or dekne, or preest, or hospitaliers. And evere the hyer
that he is in ordre, the gretter is the sinne. / The thinges that gretly
agreggen hir sinne is the brekinge of hir avow of chastitee, whan they
receyved the ordre. / And forther-over, sooth is, that holy ordre is chief
of al the tresorie of god, and his especial signe and mark of chastitee; to
shewe that they been ioyned to chastitee, which that is most precious lyf
that is. / And thise ordred folk been specially tytled to god, and of the
special meynee of god; for which, whan they doon deedly sinne, they been
the special traytours of god and of his peple; for they liven of the peple,
to preye for the peple, and whyle they been suche traitours, hir preyers
availen nat to the peple. / Preestes been aungeles, as by the dignitee of
hir misterye; but for sothe, seint Paul seith, that 'Sathanas transformeth
him in an aungel of light.' /895 Soothly, the preest that haunteth deedly
sinne, he may be lykned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the
aungel of light; he semeth aungel of light, but for sothe he is aungel of
derknesse. / Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie, as sheweth in the
book of Kinges, that they weren the sones of Belial, that is, the devel. /
Belial is to seyn 'with-outen Iuge'; and so faren they; hem thinketh they
been free, and han no Iuge, na-more than hath a free bole that taketh which
cow that him lyketh in the toun. / So faren they by wommen. For right as a
free bole is y-nough for al a toun, right so is a wikked preest corrupcioun
y-nough for al a parisshe, or for al a contree. / Thise preestes, as seith
the book, ne conne nat the misterie of preesthode to the peple, ne god ne
knowe they nat; they ne helde hem nat apayd, as seith the book, [630] of
soden flesh that was to hem offred, but they toke by force the flesh that
is rawe. /900 Certes, so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of rosted
flesh and sode flesh, with which the peple fedden hem in greet reverence,
but they wole have raw flesh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres. / And
certes, thise wommen that consenten to hir harlotrie doon greet wrong to
Crist and to holy chirche and alle halwes, and to alle soules; for they
bireven alle thise him that sholde worshipe Crist and holy chirche, and
preye for cristene soules. / And therfore han swiche preestes, and hir
lemmanes eek that consenten to hir lecherie, the malisoun of al the court
cristen, till they come to amendement. / The thridde spece of avoutrie is
som-tyme bitwixe a man and his wyf; and that is whan they take no reward in
hir assemblinge, but only to hire fleshly delyt, as seith seint Ierome; /
and ne rekken of nothing but that they been assembled; by-cause that they
been maried, al is good y-nough, as thinketh to hem. /905 But in swich folk
hath the devel power, as seyde the aungel Raphael to Thobie; for in hir
assemblinge they putten Iesu Crist out of hir herte, and yeven hem-self to
alle ordure. / The fourthe spece is, the assemblee of hem that been of hire
kinrede, or of hem that been of oon affinitee, or elles with hem with
whiche hir fadres or hir kinrede han deled in the sinne of lecherie; this
sinne maketh hem lyk to houndes, that taken no kepe to kinrede. / And
certes, parentele is in two maneres, outher goostly or fleshly; goostly, as
for to delen with hise godsibbes. / For right so as he that engendreth a
child is his fleshly fader, right so is his godfader his fader espirituel.
For which a womman may in no lasse sinne assemblen with hir godsib than
with hir owene fleshly brother. / The fifthe spece is thilke abhominable
sinne, of which that no man unnethe oghte speke ne wryte, nathelees it is
openly reherced in holy writ. /910 This cursednesse doon men and wommen in
diverse entente and in diverse manere; but though that holy writ speke of
horrible sinne, certes, holy writ may nat been defouled, na-more than the
sonne that shyneth on the mixen. / Another sinne aperteneth to lecherie,
that comth in slepinge; and this sinne cometh ofte to hem that been
maydenes, and eek to hem that been corrupt; and this sinne men clepen
pollucioun, that [631] comth in foure maneres. / Somtyme, of languissinge
of body; for the humours been to ranke and habundaunt in the body of man.
Somtyme of infermetee; for the feblesse of the vertu retentif, as phisik
maketh mencioun. Som-tyme, for surfeet of mete and drinke. / And somtyme of
vileyns thoghtes, that been enclosed in mannes minde whan he goth to slepe;
which may nat been with-oute sinne. For which men moste kepen hem wysely,
or elles may men sinnen ful grevously. /

REMEDIUM CONTRA PECCATUM LUXURIE.

§ 77. Now comth the remedie agayns Lecherie, and that is, generally,
Chastitee and Continence, that restreyneth alle the desordeynee moevinges
that comen of fleshly talentes. /915 And evere the gretter merite shal he
han, that most restreyneth the wikkede eschaufinges of the ordure of this
sinne. And this is in two maneres, that is to seyn, chastitee in mariage,
and chastitee of widwehode. / Now shaltow understonde, that matrimoine is
leefful assemblinge of man and of womman, that receyven by vertu of the
sacrement the bond, thurgh which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf,
that is to seyn, whyl that they liven bothe. / This, as seith the book, is
a ful greet sacrement. God maked it, as I have seyd, in paradys, and wolde
him-self be born in mariage. / And for to halwen mariage, he was at a
weddinge, where-as he turned water in-to wyn; which was the firste miracle
that he wroghte in erthe biforn hise disciples. / Trewe effect of mariage
clenseth fornicacioun and replenisseth holy chirche of good linage; for
that is the ende of mariage; and it chaungeth deedly sinne in-to venial
sinne bitwise hem that been y-wedded, and maketh the hertes al oon of hem
that been y-wedded, as wel as the bodies. /920 This is verray mariage, that
was establissed by god er that sinne bigan, whan naturel lawe was in his
right point in paradys; and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o
womman, and o womman but o man, as seith Seint Augustin, by manye resouns.
/

    917. E. boond.   921. E. Cm. _om._ This is.   E. natureel.

§ 78. First, for mariage is figured bitwixe Crist and holy chirche. And
that other is, for a man is heved of a womman; algate, by ordinaunce it
sholde be so. / For if a womman had mo men [632] than oon, thanne sholde
she have mo hevedes than oon, and that were an horrible thing biforn god;
and eek a womman ne mighte nat plese to many folk at ones. And also ther ne
sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem; for everich wolde axen his
owene thing. / And forther-over, no man ne sholde knowe his owene
engendrure, ne who sholde have his heritage; and the womman sholde been the
lasse biloved, fro the time that she were conioynt to many men. /

    923. E. no (_for_ mo) _before_ men.

§ 79. Now comth, how that a man sholde bere him with his wyf; and namely,
in two thinges, that is to seyn in suffraunce and reverence, as shewed
Crist whan he made first womman. /925 For he ne made hir nat of the heved
of Adam, for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe. / For ther-as the
womman hath the maistrie, she maketh to muche desray; ther neden none
ensamples of this. The experience of day by day oghte suffyse. / Also
certes, god ne made nat womman of the foot of Adam, for she ne sholde nat
been holden to lowe; for she can nat paciently suffre: but god made womman
of the rib of Adam, for womman sholde be felawe un-to man. / Man sholde
bere him to his wyf in feith, in trouthe, and in love, as seith seint Paul:
that 'a man sholde loven his wyf as Crist loved holy chirche, that loved it
so wel that he deyde for it.' So sholde a man for his wyf, if it were nede.
/

    927. Hl. disaray; Pt. Ln. disaraye.

§ 80. Now how that a womman sholde be subget to hir housbonde, that telleth
seint Peter. First, in obedience. /930 And eek, as seith the decree, a
womman that is a wyf, as longe as she is a wyf, she hath noon auctoritee to
swere ne bere witnesse with-oute leve of hir housbonde, that is hir lord;
algate, he sholde be so by resoun. / She sholde eek serven him in alle
honestee, and been attempree of hir array. I wot wel that they sholde
setten hir entente to plesen hir housbondes, but nat by hir queyntise of
array. / Seint Ierome seith, that wyves that been apparailled in silk and
in precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen hem in Iesu Crist. What seith seint
Iohn eek in this matere? / Seint Gregorie eek seith, that no wight seketh
precious array but only for veyne glorie, to been honoured the more biforn
the peple. / It is a greet folye, a womman to have a fair array outward and
in hir-self be foul inward. /935 [633] A wyf sholde eek be mesurable in
lokinge and in beringe and in laughinge, and discreet in alle hir wordes
and hir dedes. / And aboven alle worldly thing she sholde loven hir
housbonde with al hir herte, and to him be trewe of hir body / so sholde an
housbonde eek be to his wyf. For sith that al the body is the housbondes,
so sholde hir herte been, or elles ther is bitwixe hem two, as in that, no
parfit mariage. / Thanne shal men understonde that for three thinges a man
and his wyf fleshly mowen assemble. The firste is in entente of engendrure
of children to the service of god, for certes that is the cause fynal of
matrimoine. / Another cause is, to yelden everich of hem to other the dette
of hir bodies, for neither of hem hath power over his owene body. The
thridde is, for to eschewe lecherye and vileinye. The ferthe is for sothe
deadly sinne. /940 As to the firste, it is meritorie; the seconde also;
for, as seith the decree, that she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to
hir housbonde the dette of hir body, ye, though it be agayn hir lykinge and
the lust of hir herte. / The thridde manere is venial sinne, and trewely
scarsly may ther any of thise be with-oute venial sinne, for the corrupcion
and for the delyt. / The fourthe manere is for to understonde, if they
assemble only for amorous love and for noon of the forseyde causes, but for
to accomplice thilke brenninge delyt, they rekke nevere how ofte, sothly it
is deedly sinne; and yet, with sorwe, somme folk wol peynen hem more to
doon than to hir appetyt suffyseth. /

§ 81. The seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene widewe, and
eschue the embracinges of man, and desyren the embracinge of Iesu Crist. /
Thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hir housbondes, and eek
wommen that han doon lecherie and been releeved by Penitence. /945 And
certes, if that a wyf coude kepen hir al chaast by licence of hir
housbonde, so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte, it were to
hire a greet merite. / Thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be
clene in herte as well as in body and in thoght, and mesurable in clothinge
and in contenaunce; and been abstinent in etinge and drinkinge, in
spekinge, and in dede. They been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed
Magdelene, that fulfilleth holy chirche of good odour. / The thridde manere
of chastitee is [634] virginitee, and it bihoveth that she be holy in herte
and clene of body; thanne is she spouse to Iesu Crist, and she is the lyf
of angeles. / She is the preisinge of this world, and she is as thise
martirs in egalitee; she hath in hir that tonge may nat telle ne herte
thinke. / Virginitee baar oure lord Iesu Crist, and virgin was him-selve.

§ 83. Another remedie agayns Lecherie is, that a man or a womman eschue the

DE CONFESSIONE.

§ 85. Now for-as-muche as the second partie of Penitence stant in
Confessioun of mouth, as I bigan in the firste chapitre, I seye, seint
Augustin seith: / sinne is every word and every dede, and al that men
coveiten agayn the lawe of Iesu Crist; and this is for to sinne in herte,
in mouth, and in dede, by thy fyve wittes, that been sighte, heringe,
smellinge, tastinge or savouringe, and felinge. / Now is it good to
understonde that that agreggeth muchel every sinne. /960 Thou shall
considere what thou art that doost the sinne, whether thou be male or
femele, yong or old, gentil or thral, free or servant, hool or syk, wedded
or sengle, ordred or unordred, wys or fool, clerk or seculer; / if she be
of [635] thy kinrede, bodily or goostly, or noon; if any of thy kinrede
have sinned with hir or noon, and manye mo thinges. /

    960. Pt. Hl. the circumstances that; Ln. the circumstance that (_for_
    that that).   961. E. seculeer.

§ 86. Another circumstaunce is this; whether it be doon in fornicacioun, or
in avoutrie, or noon; incest, or noon; mayden, or noon; in manere of
homicyde, or noon; horrible grete sinnes, or smale; and how longe thou hast
continued in sinne. / The thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast
do sinne; whether in other mennes hous or in thyn owene; in feeld or in
chirche, or in chirche-hawe; in chirche dedicat, or noon. / For if the
chirche be halwed, and man or womman spille his kinde inwith that place by
wey of sinne, or by wikked temptacion, the chirche is entredited til it be
reconciled by the bishop; /965 and the preest that dide swich a vileinye,
to terme of al his lyf, he sholde na-more singe masse; and if he dide, he
sholde doon deedly sinne at every tyme that he so songe masse. / The
fourthe circumstaunce is, by whiche mediatours or by whiche messagers, as
for entycement, or for consentement to bere companye with felaweshipe; for
many a wrecche, for to bere companye, wil go to the devel of helle. /
Wher-fore they that eggen or consenten to the sinne been parteners of the
sinne, and of the dampnacioun of the sinner. / The fifthe circumstaunce is,
how manye tymes that he hath sinned, if it be in his minde, and how ofte
that he hath falle. / For he that ofte falleth in sinne, he despiseth the
mercy of god, and encreesseth his sinne, and is unkinde to Crist; and he
wexeth the more feble to withstonde sinne, and sinneth the more lightly,
/970 and the latter aryseth, and is the more eschew for to shryven him,
namely, to him that is his confessour. / For which that folk, whan they
falle agayn in hir olde folies, outher they forleten hir olde confessours
al outrely, or elles they departen hir shrift in diverse places; but
soothly, swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of god of hise sinnes. /
The sixte circumstaunce is, why that a man sinneth, as by whiche
temptacioun; and if him-self procure thilke temptacioun, or by the
excytinge of other folk; or if he sinne with a womman by force, or by hir
owene assent; / or if the womman, maugree hir heed, hath been afforced, or
noon; this shal she telle; for coveitise, or for poverte, and if it was hir
procuringe or noon; and swiche manere harneys. / The seventhe [636]
circumstaunce is, in what manere he hath doon his sinne, or how that she
hath suffred that folk han doon to hir. /975 And the same shal the man
telle pleynly, with alle circumstaunces; and whether he hath sinned with
comune bordel-wommen, or noon; / or doon his sinne in holy tymes, or noon;
in fasting-tymes, or noon; or biforn his shrifte, or after his latter
shrifte; / and hath, per-aventure, broken ther-fore his penance enioyned;
by whos help and whos conseil; by sorcerie or craft; al moste be told. /
Alle thise thinges, after that they been grete or smale, engreggen the
conscience of man. And eek the preest that is thy Iuge, may the bettre been
avysed of his Iugement in yevinge of thy penaunce, and that is after thy
contricioun. / For understond wel, that after tyme that a man hath defouled
his baptesme by sinne, if he wole come to salvacioun, ther is noon other
wey but by penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun; /980 and namely by the
two, if ther be a confessour to which he may shryven him; and the thridde,
if he have lyf to parfournen it. /

§ 87. Thanne shal man looke and considere, that if he wole maken a trewe
and a profitable confessioun, ther moste be foure condiciouns. / First, it
moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte, as seyde the king Ezekias to
god: 'I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn
herte.' / This condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes. The firste is,
that confessioun moste be shamefast, nat for to covere ne hyden his sinne,
for he hath agilt his god and defouled his soule. / And her-of seith seint
Augustin: 'the herte travailleth for shame of his sinne'; and for he hath
greet shamefastnesse, he is digne to have greet mercy of god. /985 Swich
was the confession of the publican, that wolde nat heven up hise eyen to
hevene, for he hadde offended god of hevene; for which shamefastnesse he
hadde anon the mercy of god. / And ther-of seith seint Augustin, that swich
shamefast folk been next foryevenesse and remissioun. / Another signe is
humilitee in confessioun; of which seith seint Peter, 'Humbleth yow under
the might of god.' The hond of god is mighty in confession, for ther-by god
foryeveth thee thy sinnes; for he allone hath the power. / And this
humilitee shal been in herte, and in signe outward; for right as he hath
humilitee to god [637] in his herte, right so sholde he humble his body
outward to the preest that sit in goddes place. / For which in no manere,
sith that Crist is sovereyn and the preest mene and mediatour bitwixe Crist
and the sinnere, and the sinnere is the laste by wey of resoun, /990 thanne
sholde nat the sinnere sitte as heighe as his confessour, but knele biforn
him or at his feet, but-if maladie destourbe it. For he shal nat taken kepe
who sit there, but in whos place that he sitteth. / A man that hath
trespased to a lord, and comth for to axe mercy and maken his accord, and
set him doun anon by the lord, men wolde holden him outrageous, and nat
worthy so sone for to have remissioun ne mercy. / The thridde signe is, how
that thy shrift sholde be ful of teres, if man may; and if man may nat wepe
with hise bodily eyen, lat him wepe in herte. / Swich was the confession of
seint Peter; for after that he hadde forsake Iesu Crist, he wente out and
weep ful bitterly. / The fourthe signe is, that he ne lette nat for shame
to shewen his confessioun. /995 Swich was the confessioun of the Magdelene,
that ne spared, for no shame of hem that weren atte feste, for to go to
oure lord Iesu Crist and biknowe to him hir sinnes. / The fifthe signe is,
that a man or a womman be obeisant to receyven the penaunce that him is
enioyned for hise sinnes; for certes Iesu Crist, for the giltes of a man,
was obedient to the deeth. /

§ 88. The seconde condicion of verray confession is, that it be hastily
doon; for certes, if a man hadde a deedly wounde, evere the lenger that he
taried to warisshe him-self, the more wolde it corrupte and haste him to
his deeth; and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to hele. / And right so
fareth sinne, that longe tyme is in a man unshewed. / Certes, a man oghte
hastily shewen hise sinnes for manye causes; as for drede of deeth, that
cometh ofte sodenly, and is in no certeyn what tyme it shal be, ne in what
place; and eek the drecchinge of o synne draweth in another; /1000 and eek
the lenger that he tarieth, the ferther he is fro Crist. And if he abyde to
his laste day, scarsly may he shryven him or remembre him of hise sinnes,
or repenten him, for the grevous maladie of his deeth. / And for-as-muche
as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Iesu Crist, whanne he hath spoken, he
shal crye to Iesu Crist at his laste day, and scarsly wol he herkne him. /
And understond that this condicioun moste han foure thinges. [638] Thy
shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed; for wikked haste doth no
profit; and that a man conne shryve him of hise sinnes be it of pryde, or
of envye, and so forth of the speces and circumstances; / and that he have
comprehended in his minde the nombre and the greetnesse of hise sinnes, and
how longe that he hath leyn in sinne; / and eek that he be contrit of hise
sinnes, and in stedefast purpos, by the grace of god, nevere eft to falle
in sinne; and eek that he drede and countrewaite him-self, that he flee the
occasiouns of sinne to whiche he is enclyned. /1005 Also thou shalt shryve
thee of alle thy sinnes to o man, and nat a parcel to o man and a parcel to
another; that is to understonde, in entente to departe thy confessioun as
for shame or drede; for it nis but stranglinge of thy soule. / For certes,
Iesu Crist is entierly al good; in him nis noon inperfeccioun; and therfore
outher he foryeveth al parfitly or never a deel. / I seye nat that if thou
be assigned to the penitauncer for certein sinne, that thou art bounde to
shewen him al the remenaunt of thy sinnes, of whiche thou hast be shriven
to thy curat, but-if it lyke to thee of thyn humilitee; this is no
departinge of shrifte. / Ne I seye nat, ther-as I speke of divisioun of
confessioun, that if thou have lycence for to shryve thee to a discreet and
an honeste preest, where thee lyketh, and by lycence of thy curat, that
thou ne mayst wel shryve thee to him of alle thy sinnes. / But lat no
blotte be bihinde; lat no sinne been untold, as fer as thou hast
remembraunce. /1010 And whan thou shalt be shriven to thy curat, telle him
eek alle the sinnes that thou hast doon sin thou were last y-shriven; this
is no wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte. /

    stedefast.   1008, 1009, 1011. E. curaat.

§ 89. Also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns. First, that thou
shryve thee by thy free wil, noght constreyned, ne for shame of folk, ne
for maladie, ne swiche thinges; for it is resoun that he that trespasseth
by his free wil, that by his free wil he confesse his trespas; / and that
noon other man telle his sinne but he him-self, ne he shal nat nayte ne
denye his sinne, ne wratthe him agayn the preest for his amonestinge to
leve sinne. / The seconde condicioun is, that thy shrift be laweful; that
is to seyn, that thou that shryvest thee, and eek the preest that hereth
thy confessioun, been verraily in the feith of holy chirche; / and that a
man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of Iesu Crist, as [639] Caym or Iudas.
/1015 And eek a man moot accusen him-self of his owene trespas, and nat
another; but he shal blame and wyten him-self and his owene malice of his
sinne, and noon other; / but nathelees, if that another man be occasioun or
entycer of his sinne, or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his
sinne is agregged, or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven him but he
telle the persone with which he hath sinned; thanne may he telle; / so that
his entente ne be nat to bakbyte the persone, but only to declaren his
confessioun. /

§ 90. Thou ne shall nat eek make no lesinges in thy confessioun; for
humilitee, per-aventure, to seyn that thou hast doon sinnes of whiche that
thou were nevere gilty. / For Seint Augustin seith: if thou, by cause of
thyn humilitee, makest lesinges on thy-self, though thou ne were nat in
sinne biforn, yet artow thanne in sinne thurgh thy lesinges. /1020 Thou
most eek shewe thy sinne by thyn owene propre mouth, but thou be wexe
doumb, and nat by no lettre; for thou that hast doon the sinne, thou shalt
have the shame therfore. / Thou shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by
faire subtile wordes, to covere the more thy sinne; for thanne bigylestow
thy-self and nat the preest; thou most tellen it pleynly, be it nevere so
foul ne so horrible. / Thou shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that is
discreet to conseille thee, and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for veyne
glorie, ne for ypocrisye, ne for no cause, but only for the doute of Iesu
Crist and the hele of thy soule. / Thou shalt nat eek renne to the preest
sodeynly, to tellen him lightly thy sinne, as who-so telleth a Iape or a
tale, but avysely and with greet devocioun. / And generally, shryve thee
ofte. If thou ofte falle, ofte thou aryse by confessioun. /1025 And thogh
thou shryve thee ofter than ones of sinne, of which thou hast be shriven,
it is the more merite. And, as seith seint Augustin, thou shalt have the
more lightly relesing and grace of god, bothe of sinne and of peyne. / And
certes, ones a yere atte leeste wey it is laweful for to been housled; for
certes ones a yere alle thinges renovellen. /

EXPLICIT SECUNDA PARS PENITENCIE; ET SEQUITUR TERCIA PARS EIUSDEM, DE
SATISFACCIONE.

§ 91. Now have I told you of verray Confessioun, that is the seconde partie
of Penitence. /

    1028. E. toolde.

[640] The thridde partie of Penitence is Satisfaccioun; and that stant most
generally in almesse and in bodily peyne. / Now been ther three manere of
almesses; contricion of herte, where a man offreth himself to god; another
is, to han pitee of defaute of hise neighebores; and the thridde is, in
yevinge of good conseil goostly and bodily, where men han nede, and namely
in sustenaunce of mannes fode. /1030 And tak keep, that a man hath need of
thise thinges generally; he hath need of fode, he hath nede of clothing,
and herberwe, he hath nede of charitable conseil, and visitinge in prisone
and in maladie, and sepulture of his dede body. / And if thou mayst nat
visite the nedeful with thy persone, visite him by thy message and by thy
yiftes. / Thise been generally almesses or werkes of charitee of hem that
han temporel richesses or discrecioun in conseilinge. Of thise werkes
shaltow heren at the day of dome. /

    1031. Hl. keep; Pt. Ln. kepe; E. Cm. _om._   1033. E. temporeel.

§ 92. Thise almesses shaltow doon of thyne owene propre thinges, and
hastily, and prively if thou mayst; / but nathelees, if thou mayst nat doon
it prively, thou shalt nat forbere to doon almesse though men seen it; so
that it be nat doon for thank of the world, but only for thank of Iesu
Crist. /1035 For as witnesseth Seint Mathew, _capitulo quinto_, 'A citee
may nat been hid that is set on a montayne; ne men lighte nat a lanterne
and put it under a busshel; but men sette it on a candle-stikke, to yeve
light to the men in the hous. / Right so shal youre light lighten bifore
men, that they may seen youre gode werkes, and glorifie youre fader that is
in hevene.' /

§ 93. Now as to speken of bodily peyne, it stant in preyeres, in wakinges,
in fastinges, in vertuouse techinges of orisouns. / And ye shul
understonde, that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a pilous wil of
herte, that redresseth it in god and expresseth it by word outward, to
remoeven harmes and to han thinges espirituel and durable, and somtyme
temporel thinges; of whiche orisouns, certes, in the orisoun of the
_Pater-noster_, hath Iesu Crist enclosed most thinges. / Certes, it is
privileged of three thinges in his dignitee, for which it is more digne
than any other preyere; for that Iesu Crist him-self maked it; /1040 and it
is short, for it sholde be coud the more lightly, and for to withholden it
the more esily in herte, and helpen him-self the ofter with the orisoun; /
[641] and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seyen it, and for a man may
nat excusen him to lerne it, it is so short and so esy; and for it
comprehendeth in it-self alle gode preyeres. / The exposicioun of this holy
preyere, that is so excellent and digne, I bitake to thise maistres of
theologie; save thus muchel wol I seyn: that, whan thou prayest that god
sholde foryeve thee thy giltes as thou foryevest hem that agilten to thee,
be ful wel war that thou be nat out of charitee. / This holy orisoun
amenuseth eek venial sinne; and therfore it aperteneth specially to
penitence. /

    1039. E. espiritueel; temporele.

§ 94. This preyere moste be trewely seyd and in verray feith, and that men
preye to god ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly; and alwey a man shal
putten his wil to be subget to the wille of god. /1045 This orisoun moste
eek been seyd with greet humblesse and ful pure; honestly, and nat to the
anoyaunce of any man or womman. It moste eek been continued with the werkes
of charitee. / It avayleth eek agayn the vyces of the soule; for, as seith
seint Ierome, 'By fastinge been saved the vyces of the flesh, and by
preyere the vyces of the soule.' /

    1047. vyces (3)] E. vertues; Cm. vertu.

§ 95. After this, thou shalt understonde, that bodily peyne stant in
wakinge; for Iesu Crist seith, 'waketh, and preyeth that ye ne entre in
wikked temptacioun.' / Ye shul understanden also, that fastinge stant in
three thinges; in forberinge of bodily mete and drinke, and in forberinge
of worldly Iolitee, and in forberinge of deedly sinne; this is to seyn,
that a man shal kepen him fro deedly sinne with al his might. /

§ 96. And thou shalt understanden eek, that god ordeyned fastinge; and to
fastinge appertenen foure thinges. /1050 Largenesse to povre folk,
gladnesse of herte espirituel, nat to been angry ne anoyed, ne grucche for
he fasteth; and also resonable houre for to ete by mesure; that is for to
seyn, a man shal nat ete in untyme, ne sitte the lenger at his table to ete
for he fasteth. /

    1051. E. espiritueel.

§ 97. Thanne shaltow understonde, that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or
techinge, by word or by wrytinge, or in ensample. Also in weringe of heyres
or of stamin, or of haubergeons on hir naked flesh, for Cristes sake, and
swiche manere penances. / But war thee wel that swiche manere penances on
thy flesh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thy-self; for
bettre is to caste [642] awey thyn heyre, than for to caste away the
sikernesse of Iesu Crist. / And therfore seith seint Paul: 'Clothe yow, as
they that been chosen of god, in herte of misericorde, debonairetee,
suffraunce, and swich manere of clothinge'; of whiche Iesu Crist is more
apayed than of heyres, or haubergeons, or hauberkes. /

wronges that been doon to thee, and eek in pacient suffraunce of maladies,
or lesinge of worldly catel, or of wyf, or of child, or othere freendes. /

§ 99. Thanne shaltow understonde, whiche thinges destourben penaunce; and
this is in foure maneres, that is, drede, shame, hope, and wanhope, that
is, desperacion. / And for to speke first of drede; for which he weneth
that he may suffre no penaunce; / ther-agayns is remedie for to thinke,
that bodily penaunce is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of
helle, that is so cruel and so long, that it lasteth with-outen ende. /

    1058. weneth] E. demeth.   1059. E. crueel; peynes.

§ 100. Now again the shame that a man hath to shryven him, and namely,
thise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to
shryven hem; /1060 agayns that shame, sholde a man thinke that, by wey of
resoun, that he that hath nat been ashamed to doon foule thinges, certes
him oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thinges, and that is confessiouns. /
A man sholde eek thinke, that god seeth and wool alle hise thoghtes and
alle hise werkes; to him may no thing been hid ne covered. / Men sholden
eek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day of dome, to hem
that been nat penitent and shriven in this present lyf. / For alle the
creatures in erthe and in helle shullen seen apertly al that they hyden in
this world. /

    1061. ashamed (1)] E. shamed.

§ 101. Now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe
to shryven hem, that stant in two maneres. /1065 That oon is, that he
hopeth for to live longe and for to purchacen muche richesse for his delyt,
and thanne he wol shryven him; and, as he seith, him semeth thanne tymely
y-nough to come to shrifte. Another is, surquidrie that he hath in Cristes
mercy. / Agayns the firste vyce, he shal thinke, that oure lyf is in no
sikernesse; and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben in aventure,
and passen as a shadwe on the wal. / And, as seith seint Gregorie, [643]
that it aperteneth to the grete rightwisnesse of god, that nevere shal the
peyne stinte of hem that nevere wolde withdrawen hem fro sinne, hir
thankes, but ay continue in sinne; for thilke perpetuel wil to do sinne
shul they han perpetuel peyne. /

    1065. E. _om._ the.   1069. E. perpetueel (_twice_).

§ 102. Wanhope is in two maneres: the firste wanhope is in the mercy of
Crist; that other is that they thinken, that they ne mighte nat longe
persevere in goodnesse. /1070 The firste wanhope comth of that he demeth
that he hath sinned so greetly and so ofte, and so longe leyn in sinne,
that he shal nat be saved. / Certes, agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he
thinke, that the passion of Iesu Crist is more strong for to unbinde than
sinne is strong for to binde. / Agayns the seconde wanhope, he shal thinke,
that as ofte as he falleth he may aryse agayn by penitence. And thogh he
never so longe have leyn in sinne, the mercy of Crist is alwey redy to
receiven him to mercy. / Agayns the wanhope, that he demeth that he sholde
nat longe persevere in goodnesse, he shal thinke, that the feblesse of the
devel may no-thing doon but-if men wol suffren him; / and eek he shal han
strengthe of the help of god, and of al holy chirche, and of the
proteccioun of aungels, if him list. /1075

§ 103. Thanne shal men understonde what is the fruit of penaunce; and,
after the word of Iesu Crist, it is the endelees blisse of hevene, / ther
Ioye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce, ther alle harmes been
passed of this present lyf; ther-as is the sikernesse fro the peyne of
helle; ther-as is the blisful companye that reioysen hem everemo, everich
of otheres Ioye; / ther-as the body of man, that whylom was foul and derk,
is more cleer than the sonne; ther-as the body, that whylom was syk,
freele, and feble, and mortal, is inmortal, and so strong and so hool that
ther may no-thing apeyren it; / ther-as ne is neither hunger, thurst, ne
cold, but every soule replenissed with the sighte of the parfit knowinge of
god. / This blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espirituel, and the
glorie by lowenesse; the plentee of Ioye by hunger and thurst, and the
reste by travaille; and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of sinne. /1080

lord Iesu Crist, of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse. / And if ther
be any thing that displese hem, I preye hem also that they arrette it to
the defaute of myn unconninge, and nat to my wil, that wolde ful fayn have
seyd bettre if I hadde had conninge. / For oure boke seith, 'al that is
writen is writen for oure doctrine'; and that is myn entente. / Wherfore I
biseke yow mekely for the mercy of god, that ye preye for me, that Crist
have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes: / --and namely, of my
translacions and endytinges of worldly vanitees, the whiche I revoke in my
retracciouns: /1085 as is the book of Troilus; The book also of Fame; The
book of the nynetene Ladies; The book of the Duchesse; The book of seint
Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes; The tales of Caunterbury,
thilke that sounen in-to sinne; / The book of the Leoun; and many another
book, if they were in my remembrance; and many a song and many a lecherous
lay; that Crist for his grete mercy foryeve me the sinne. / But of the
translacion of Boece de Consolacione, and othere bokes of Legendes of
seintes, and omelies, and moralitee, and devocioun, / that thanke I oure
lord Iesu Crist and his blisful moder, and alle the seintes of hevene; /
bisekinge hem that they from hennes-forth, un-to my lyves ende, sende me
grace to biwayle my giltes, and to studie to the salvacioun of my
soule:--and graunte me grace of verray penitence, confessioun and
satisfaccioun to doon in this present lyf; /1090 thurgh the benigne grace
of him that is king of kinges and preest over alle preestes, that boghte us
with the precious blood of his herte; / so that I may been oon of hem at

  Litheth, and lesteneth · and herkeneth aright,
  And ye schulle heere a talking · of a doughty knight;
  Sire Iohan of Boundys · was his righte name,
  He cowde of norture y-nough · and mochil of game.
  Thre sones the knight hadde · that with his body he wan;       5
  The eldest was a moche schrewe · and sone he bigan.
  His bretheren loved wel here fader · and of him were agast,
  The eldest deserved his fadres curs · and had it at the last.
  The goode knight his fader · livede so yore,
  That deth was comen him to · and handled him ful sore.        10
  The goode knight cared sore · syk ther he lay,
  How his children scholde · liven after his day.
  He hadde ben wyde-wher · but non housbond he was,
  Al the lond that he hadde · it was verrey purchas.
  Fayn he wolde it were · dressed among hem alle,               15
  That ech of hem hadde his part · as it mighte falle.
  Tho sente he in-to cuntre · after wyse knightes,
  To helpe delen his londes · and dressen hem to-rightes.
  He sente hem word by lettres · they schulden hye blyve,
  If they wolde speke with him · whyl he was on lyve.           20

  Tho the knightes herden · syk that he lay,
  Hadde they no reste · nother night ne day,
  Til they comen to him · ther he lay stille
  On his deth-bedde · to abyde goddes wille.
  Than seyde the goode knight · syk ther he lay,                25
  'Lordes, I you warne · for soth, withoute nay,
  I may no lenger liven · heer in this stounde;
  [646]
  For thurgh goddes wille · deth draweth me to grounde.'
  Ther nas non of hem alle · that herde him aright,
  That they ne hadden reuthe · of that ilke knight,             30
  And seyde, 'sir, for goddes love · ne dismay you nought;
  God may do bote of bale · that is now y-wrought.'

    Than spak the goode knight · syk ther he lay,
  'Boote of bale god may sende · I wot it is no nay;
  But I byseke you, knightes · for the love of me,              35
  Goth and dresseth my lond · among my sones three.
  And sires, for the love of god · deleth hem nat amis,
  And forgetith nat Gamelyn · my yonge sone that is.
  Taketh heed to that on · as wel as to that other;
  Selde ye see ony eyr · helpen his brother.'                   40

    36. Hl. thre.   37. Hl. And sires; _rest om._ sires.

    Tho leete they the knight lyen · that was nought in hele,
  And wenten in-to counsel · his londes for to dele;
  For to delen hem alle · to oon, that was her thought,
  And for Gamelyn was yongest · he schulde have nought.
  Al the lond that ther was · they dalten it in two,            45
  And leeten Gamelyn the yonge · withoute londe go,
  And ech of hem seyde · to other ful lowde,
  His bretheren mighte yeve him lond · whan he good cowde.
  Whan they hadde deled · the lond at here wille,
  They comen ayein to the knight · ther he lay ful stille,      50
  And tolden him anon-right · how they hadden wrought;
  And the knight ther he lay · lyked it right nought.
  Than seyde the knight · 'by seynt Martyn,
  For al that ye have y-doon · yit is the lond myn;
  For goddes love, neyhebours · stondeth alle stille,           55
  And I wil dele my lond · right after my wille.
  Iohan, myn eldeste sone · schal have plowes fyve,
  That was my fadres heritage · whyl he was on lyve;
  And my middeleste sone · fyve plowes of lond,
  That I halp for to gete · with my righte hond;                60
  And al myn other purchas · of londes and leedes,
  That I biquethe Gamelyn · and alle my goode steedes.
  And I biseke yow, goode men · that lawe conne of londe,
  For Gamelynes love · that my queste stonde.'
  Thus dalte the knight · his lond by his day,                  65
  Right on his deth-bedde · syk ther he lay;
  And sone aftirward · he lay stoon-stille,
  And deyde whan tyme com · as it was Cristes wille.
  [647]
  And anon as he was deed · and under gras y-grave,
  Sone the elder brother · gyled the yonge knave;               70
  He took into his hond · his lond and his leede,
  And Gamelyn himselfe · to clothen and to feede.
  He clothed him and fedde him · yvel and eek wrothe,
  And leet his londes for-fare · and his houses bothe,
  His parkes and his woodes · and dede nothing wel;             75
  And seththen he it aboughte · on his faire fel.
  So longe was Gamelyn · in his brotheres halle,
  For the strengest, of good wil · they doutiden him alle;
  Ther was non ther-inne · nowther yong ne old,
  That wolde wraththe Gamelyn · were he never so bold.          80
  Gamelyn stood on a day · in his brotheres yerde,
  And bigan with his hond · to handlen his berde;
  He thoughte on his londes · that layen unsawe,
  And his faire okes · that down were y-drawe;
  His parkes were y-broken · and his deer bireved;              85
  Of alle his goode steedes · noon was him bileved;
  His howses were unhiled · and ful yvel dight;
  Tho thoughte Gamelyn · it wente nought aright.
  Afterward cam his brother · walkinge thare,
  And seyde to Gamelyn · 'is our mete yare?'                    90
  Tho wraththed him Gamelyn · and swor by goddes book,
  'Thou schalt go bake thy-self · I wil nought be thy cook!'
  'How? brother Gamelyn · how answerest thou now?
  Thou spake never such a word · as thou dost now.'
  'By my faith,' seyde Gamelyn · 'now me thinketh neede,        95
  Of alle the harmes that I have · I tok never ar heede.
  My parkes ben to-broken · and my deer bireved,
  Of myn armure and my steedes · nought is me bileved;
  Al that my fader me biquath · al goth to schame,
  And therfor have thou goddes curs · brother by thy name!'    100
  Than bispak his brother · that rape was of rees,
  'Stond stille, gadeling · and hold right thy pees;
  Thou schalt be fayn for to have · thy mete and thy wede;
  What spekest thou, Gamelyn · of lond other of leede?'
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · the child that was ying,              105
  'Cristes curs mot he have · that clepeth me gadeling!
  I am no worse gadeling · ne no worse wight,
  But born of a lady · and geten of a knight.'
  Ne durste he nat to Gamelyn · ner a-foote go,
  But clepide to him his men · and seyde to hem tho,           110
  [648]
  'Goth and beteth this boy · and reveth him his wit,
  And lat him lerne another tyme · to answere me bet.'
  Thanne seyde the child · yonge Gamelyn,
  'Cristes curs mot thou have · brother art thou myn!
  And if I schal algate · be beten anon,                       115
  Cristes curs mot thou have · but thou be that oon!'
  And anon his brother · in that grete hete
  Made his men to fette staves · Gamelyn to bete.
  Whan that everich of hem · a staf hadde y-nome,
  Gamelyn was war anon · tho he seigh hem come;                120
  Tho Gamelyn seigh hem come · he loked over-al,
  And was war of a pestel · stood under a wal;
  Gamelyn was light of foot · and thider gan he lepe,
  And drof alle his brotheres men · right on an hepe.
  He loked as a wilde lyoun · and leyde on good woon;          125
  Tho his brother say that · he bigan to goon;
  He fley up in-til a loft · and schette the dore fast;
  Thus Gamelyn with the pestel · made hem alle agast.
  Some for Gamelynes love · and some for his eye,
  Alle they drowe by halves · tho he gan to pleye.             130
  'What! how now?' seyde Gamelyn · 'evel mot ye thee!
  Wil ye biginne contek · and so sone flee?'
  Gamelyn soughte his brother · whider he was flowe,
  And saugh wher he loked · out at a windowe.
  'Brother,' sayde Gamelyn · 'com a litel ner,                 135
  And I wil teche thee a play · atte bokeler.'
  His brother him answerde · and swor by seynt Richer,
  'Whyl the pestel is in thin hond · I wil come no neer:
  Brother, I wil make thy pees · I swere by Cristes ore;
  Cast away the pestel · and wraththe thee no-more.'           140
  'I mot neede,' sayde Gamelyn · 'wraththe me at oones,
  For thou wolde make thy men · to breke myne boones,
  Ne hadde I had mayn · and might in myn armes,
  To have y-put hem fro me · they wolde have do me harmes.'
  'Gamelyn,' sayde his brother · 'be thou nought wroth,        145
  For to seen thee have harm · it were me right loth;
  I ne dide it nought, brother · but for a fonding,
  For to loken if thou were strong · and art so ying.'
  'Com a-doun than to me · and graunte me my bone
  Of thing I wil thee aske · and we schul saughte sone.'       150
  Doun than cam his brother · that fikil was and fel,
  [649]
  And was swithe sore · agast of the pestel.
  He seyde, 'brother Gamelyn · aske me thy boone,
  And loke thou me blame · but I graunte sone.'
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · 'brother, y-wis,                      155
  And we schulle ben at oon · thou most me graunte this:
  Al that my fader me biquath · whyl he was on lyve,
  Thou most do me it have · yif we schul nat stryve.'
  'That schalt thou have, Gamelyn · I swere by Cristes ore!
  Al that thy fader thee biquath · though thou woldest have more;  160
  Thy lond, that lyth laye · ful wel it schal be sowe,
  And thyn howses reysed up · that ben leyd so lowe.'
  Thus seyde the knight · to Gamelyn with mowthe,
  And thoughte eek of falsnes · as he wel couthe.
  The knight thoughte on tresoun · and Gamelyn on noon,        165
  And wente and kiste his brother · and, whan they were at oon,
  Allas! yonge Gamelyn · nothing he ne wiste
  With which a false tresoun · his brother him kiste!

  Moche worschip it were · brother, to us alle,                185
  Might I the ram and the ring · bring home to this halle.'
  A steede ther was sadeled · smertely and skeet;
  Gamelyn did a paire spores · fast on his feet.
  He sette his foot in the styrop · the steede he bistrood,
  [650]
  And toward the wrasteling · the yonge child rood.            190

  As sone as Gamelyn com · ther the place was,                 195
  He lighte doun of his steede · and stood on the gras,

  'Goode man,' seyde Gamelyn · 'why makestow this fare?
  Is ther no man that may · you helpe out of this care?'       200
  'Allas!' seyde this frankeleyn · 'that ever was I bore!
  For tweye stalworthe sones · I wene that I have lore;

  For he hath slayn my two sones · but-if god hem borwe.
  I wold yeve ten pound · by Iesu Crist! and more,             205

  'Goode man,' sayde Gamelyn · 'wilt thou wel doon,
  Hold myn hors, whyl my man · draweth of my schoon,
  And help my man to kepe · my clothes and my steede,
  And I wil into place go · to loke if I may speede.'          210
  'By god!' sayde the frankeleyn · 'anon it schal be doon;

    Barfoot and ungert · Gamelyn in cam,                       215
  Alle that weren in the place · heede of him they nam,
  How he durste auntre him · of him to doon his might
  That was so doughty champioun · in wrastling and in fight.
  Up sterte the champioun · rapely and anoon,
  Toward yonge Gamelyn · he bigan to goon,                     220
  And sayde, 'who is thy fader · and who is thy sire?
  For sothe thou art a gret fool · that thou come hire!'
  Gamelyn answerde · the champioun tho,
  'Thou knewe wel my fader · whyl he couthe go,
  Whyles he was on lyve · by seint Martyn!                     225
  Sir Iohan of Boundys was his name · and I Gamelyn.'
  'Felaw,' seyde the champioun · 'al-so mot I thryve,
  I knew wel thy fader · whyl he was on lyve;
  And thyself, Gamelyn · I wil that thou it heere,
  [651]
  Whyl thou were a yong boy · a moche schrewe thou were.'      230
  Than seyde Gamelyn · and swor by Cristes ore,
  'Now I am older woxe · thou schalt me finde a more!'
  'By god!' sayde the champioun · 'welcome mote thou be!
  Come thou ones in myn hond · schalt thou never thee.'
  It was wel withinne the night · and the moone schon,         235
  Whan Gamelyn and the champioun · togider gonne goon.
  The champioun caste tornes · to Gamelyn that was prest,
  And Gamelyn stood stille · and bad him doon his best.
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · to the champioun,
  'Thou art faste aboute · to bringe me adoun;                 240
  Now I have y-proved · many tornes of thyne,
  Thow most,' he seyde, 'proven · on or two of myne.'
  Gamelyn to the champioun · yede smertely anon,
  Of all the tornes that he cowthe · he schewed him but oon,
  And caste him on the lefte syde · that three ribbes to-brak,  245
  And ther-to his oon arm · that yaf a gret crak.
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · smertely anoon,
  'Schal it be holde for a cast · or elles for noon?'
  'By god!' seyde the champioun · 'whether that it be,
  He that cometh ones in thin hand · schal he never thee!'     250
  Than seyde the frankeleyn · that had his sones there,
  'Blessed be thou, Gamelyn · that ever thou bore were!'
  The frankeleyn seyde to the champioun · of him stood him noon eye,
  'This is yonge Gamelyn · that taughte thee this pleye.'
  Agein answerd the champioun · that lyked nothing wel,        255
  'He is a lither mayster · and his pley is right fel;
  Sith I wrastled first · it is y-go ful yore,
  But I was nevere in my lyf · handeled so sore.'
  Gamelyn stood in the place · allone withoute serk,
  And seyde, 'if ther be eny mo · lat hem come to werk;        260
  The champioun that peyned him · to werke so sore,
  It semeth by his continaunce · that he wil no-more.'
  Gamelyn in the place · stood as stille as stoon,
  For to abyde wrasteling · but ther com noon;
  Ther was noon with Gamelyn · wolde wrastle more,             265
  For he handled the champioun · so wonderly sore.
  Two gentil-men ther were · that yemede the place,
  Comen to Gamelyn · (god yeve him goode grace!)
  And sayde to him, 'do on · thyn hosen and thy schoon,
  [652]
  For sothe at this tyme · this feire is y-doon.'              270
  And than seyde Gamelyn · 'so mot I wel fare,
  I have nought yet halven-del · sold up my ware.'
  Tho seyde the champioun · 'so brouke I my sweere,
  He is a fool that ther-of byeth · thou sellest it so deere.'
  Tho sayde the frankeleyn · that was in moche care,           275
  'Felaw,' he seyde · 'why lakkest thou his ware?
  By seynt Iame in Galys · that many man hath sought,
  Yet it is to good cheep · that thou hast y-bought.'
  Tho that wardeynes were · of that wrasteling
  Come and broughte Gamelyn · the ram and the ring,            280
  And seyden, 'have, Gamelyn · the ring and the ram,
  For the beste wrasteler · that ever here cam.'
  Thus wan Gamelyn · the ram and the ring,
  And wente with moche Ioye · home in the morning.
  His brother seih wher he cam · with the grete rowte,         285
  And bad schitte the gate · and holde him withoute.
  The porter of his lord · was ful sore agast,
  And sterte anon to the gate · and lokked it fast.

    Now litheth, and lesteneth · bothe yonge and olde,
  And ye schul heere gamen · of Gamelyn the bolde.             290
  Gamelyn come ther-to · for to have comen in,
  And thanne was it y-schet · faste with a pin;
  Than seyde Gamelyn · 'porter, undo the yat,
  For many good mannes sone · stondeth ther-at.'
  Than answerd the porter · and swor by goddes berde,          295
  'Thow ne schalt, Gamelyn · come into this yerde.'
  'Thow lixt,' sayde Gamelyn · 'so browke I my chin!'
  He smot the wiket with his foot · and brak awey the pin.
  The porter seyh tho · it might no better be,
  He sette foot on erthe · and bigan to flee.                  300
  'By my faith,' seyde Gamelyn · 'that travail is y-lore,
  For I am of foot as light as thou · though thou haddest swore.'
  Gamelyn overtook the porter · and his teene wrak,
  And gerte him in the nekke · that the bon to-brak,
  And took him by that oon arm · and threw him in a welle,     305
  Seven fadmen it was deep · as I have herd telle.
  Whan Gamelyn the yonge · thus hadde pleyd his play,
  Alle that in the yerde were · drewen hem away;
  They dredden him ful sore · for werkes that he wroughte,
  And for the faire company · that he thider broughte.         310
  [653]
  Gamelyn yede to the gate · and leet it up wyde;
  He leet in alle maner men · that gon in wolde or ryde,
  And seyde, 'ye be welcome · withouten eny greeve,
  For we wiln be maistres heer · and aske no man leve.
  Yestirday I lefte' · seyde yonge Gamelyn,                    315
  'In my brother seller · fyve tonne of wyn;
  I wil not that this compaignye · parten a-twinne,
  And ye wil doon after me · whyl eny sope is thrinne,
  And if my brother grucche · or make foul cheere,
  Other for spense of mete or drink · that we spenden heere,   320
  I am oure catour · and bere oure aller purs,
  He schal have for his grucching · seint Maries curs.
  My brother is a niggoun · I swer by Cristes ore,
  And we wil spende largely · that he hath spared yore;
  And who that maketh grucching · that we here dwelle,         325
  He schal to the porter · into the draw-welle.'
  Seven dayes and seven night · Gamelyn held his feste,
  With moche mirth and solas · that was ther, and no cheste;
  In a little toret · his brother lay y-steke,
  And sey hem wasten his good · but durste he not speke.       330
  Erly on a morning · on the eighte day,
  The gestes come to Gamelyn · and wolde gon here way.
  'Lordes,' seyde Gamelyn · 'wil ye so hyë?
  Al the wyn is not yet dronke · so brouke I myn yë.'
  Gamelyn in his herte · was he ful wo,                        335
  Whan his gestes took her leve · from him for to go;
  He wolde they had lenger abide · and they seyde 'nay,'
  But bitaughte Gamelyn · god, and good day.
  Thus made Gamelyn his feest · and broughte it wel to ende,
  And after his gestes · toke leve to wende.                   340

    Litheth, and lesteneth · and holdeth youre tonge,
  And ye schul heere gamen · of Gamelyn the yonge;
  Herkeneth, lordinges · and lesteneth aright,
  Whan alle gestes were goon · how Gamelyn was dight.
  Al the whyl that Gamelyn · heeld his mangerye,               345
  His brother thoughte on him be wreke · with his treccherye.
  Tho Gamelyns gestes · were riden and y-goon,
  Gamelyn stood allone · frendes had he noon;
  Tho after ful soone · withinne a litel stounde,
  [654]
  Gamelyn was y-taken · and ful harde y-bounde.                350
  Forth com the false knight · out of the soleer,
  To Gamelyn his brother · he yede ful neer,
  And sayde to Gamelyn · 'who made thee so bold
  For to stroye my stoor · of myn houshold?'
  'Brother,' seyde Gamelyn · 'wraththe thee right nought,      355
  For it is many day y-gon · siththen it was bought;
  For, brother, thou hast y-had · by seynt Richer,
  Of fiftene plowes of lond · this sixtene yer,
  And of alle the beestes · thou hast forth bred,
  That my fader me biquath · on his deth-bed;                  360
  Of al this sixtene yeer · I yeve thee the prow,
  For the mete and the drink · that we have spended now.'
  Thanne seyde the false knight · (evel mot he thee!)
  'Herkne, brother Gamelyn · what I wol yeve thee;
  For of my body, brother · heir geten have I noon,            365
  I wil make thee myn heir · I swere by seint Iohan.'
  '_Par ma foy!_' sayde Gamelyn · 'and if it so be,
  And thou thenke as thou seyst · god yelde it thee!'
  Nothing wiste Gamelyn · of his brotheres gyle;
  Therfore he him bigyled · in a litel whyle.                  370
  'Gamelyn,' seyde he · 'o thing I thee telle;
  Tho thou threwe my porter · in the draw-welle,
  I swor in that wraththe · and in that grete moot,
  That thou schuldest be bounde · bothe hand and foot;
  Therfore I thee biseche · brother Gamelyn,                   375
  Lat me nought be forsworen · brother art thou myn;
  Lat me binde thee now · bothe hand and feet,
  For to holde myn avow · as I thee biheet.'
  'Brother,' sayde Gamelyn · 'al-so mot I thee!
  Thou schalt not be forsworen · for the love of me.'          380
  Tho made they Gamelyn to sitte · mighte he nat stonde,
  Til they hadde him bounde · bothe foot and honde.
  The false knight his brother · of Gamelyn was agast,
  And sente aftir feteres · to feteren him fast.
  His brother made lesinges · on him ther he stood,            385
  And tolde hem that comen in · that Gamelyn was wood.
  Gamelyn stood to a post · bounden in the halle,
  Tho that comen in ther · lokede on him alle.
  Ever stood Gamelyn · even upright;
  [655]
  But mete ne drink had he non · neither day ne night.         390
  Than seyde Gamelyn · 'brother, by myn hals,
  Now I have aspyed · thou art a party fals;
  Had I wist that tresoun · that thou haddest y-founde,
  I wolde have yeve thee strokes · or I had be bounde!'
  Gamelyn stood bounden · stille as eny stoon;                 395
  Two dayes and two nightes · mete had he noon.
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · that stood y-bounde stronge,
  'Adam spenser · me thinkth I faste to longe;
  Adam spenser · now I byseche thee,
  For the mochel love · my fader loved thee,                   400
  If thou may come to the keyes · lese me out of bond,
  And I wil parte with thee · of my free lond.'
  Thanne seyde Adam · that was the spencer,
  'I have served thy brother · this sixtene yeer,
  If I leete thee goon · out of his bour,                      405
  He wolde say afterward · I were a traytour.'
  'Adam,' sayde Gamelyn · 'so brouke I myn hals!
  Thou schalt finde my brother · atte laste fals;
  Therfor, brother Adam · louse me out of bond,
  And I wil parte with thee · of my free lond.'                410
  'Up swich a forward' · seyde Adam, 'y-wis,
  I wil do therto · al that in me is.'
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'al-so mot I thee,
  I wol holde thee covenant · and thou wil me.'
  Anon as Adames lord · to bedde was y-goon,                   415
  Adam took the keyes, and leet · Gamelyn out anoon;
  He unlokked Gamelyn · bothe handes and feet,
  In hope of avauncement · that he him biheet.
  Than seyde Gamelyn · 'thanked be goddes sonde!
  Now I am loosed · bothe foot and honde;                      420
  Had I now eten · and dronken aright,
  Ther is noon in this hous · schulde binde me this night.'
  Adam took Gamelyn · as stille as ony stoon,
  And ladde him in-to spence · rapely and anon,
  And sette him to soper · right in a privee stede,            425
  He bad him do gladly · and Gamelyn so dede.
  Anon as Gamelyn hadde · eten wel and fyn,
  And therto y-dronke wel · of the rede wyn,
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'what is now thy reed?
  Wher I go to my brother · and girde of his heed?'            430
  'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam · 'it schal not be so.
  I can teche thee a reed · that is worth the two.
  [656]
  I wot wel for sothe · that this is no nay,
  We schul have a mangery · right on Soneday;
  Abbotes and priours · many heer schal be,                    435
  And other men of holy chirche · as I telle thee;
  Thow schalt stonde up by the post · as thou were hond-fast,
  And I schal leve hem unloke · awey thou may hem cast.
  Whan that they have eten · and wasschen here hondes,
  Thou schalt biseke hem alle · to bring thee out of bondes;   440
  And if they wille borwe thee · that were good game,
  Then were thou out of prisoun · and I out of blame;
  And if everich of hem · say unto us 'nay,'
  I schal do an other · I swere by this day!
  Thou schalt have a good staf · and I wil have another,       445
  And Cristes curs have that oon · that faileth that other!'
  'Ye, for gode!' sayde Gamelyn · 'I say it for me,
  If I fayle on my syde · yvel mot I thee!
  If we schul algate · assoile hem of here sinne,
  Warne me, brother Adam · whan I schal biginne.'              450
  'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam · 'by seynte Charite,
  I wil warne thee biforn · whan that it schal be;
  Whan I twinke on thee · loke for to goon,
  And cast awey the feteres · and com to me anoon.'
  'Adam,' seide Gamelyn · 'blessed be thy bones!               455
  That is a good counseil · yeven for the nones;
  If they werne me thanne · to bringe me out of bendes,
  I wol sette goode strokes · right on here lendes.'

    Tho the Sonday was y-come · and folk to the feste,
  Faire they were welcomed · both leste and meste;             460
  And ever atte halle-dore · as they comen in,
  They caste their eye · on yonge Gamelyn.
  The false knight his brother · ful of trechery,
  Alle the gestes that ther were · atte mangery,
  Of Gamelyn his brother · he tolde hem with mouthe            465
  Al the harm and the schame · that he telle couthe.
  Tho they were served · of messes two or three,
  Than seyde Gamelyn · 'how serve ye me?
  It is nought wel served · by god that al made!
  That I sitte fasting · and other men make glade.'            470
  The false knight his brother · ther that he stood,
  Tolde alle his gestes · that Gamelyn was wood;
  [657]
  And Gamelyn stood stille · and answerde nought,
  But Adames wordes · he held in his thought.
  Tho Gamelyn gan speke · dolfully with-alle                   475
  To the grete lordes · that saten in the halle:
  'Lordes,' he seyde · 'for Cristes passioun,
  Helpeth bringe Gamelyn · out of prisoun.'
  Than seyde an abbot · sorwe on his cheeke!
  'He schal have Cristes curs · and seynte Maries eeke,        480
  That thee out of prisoun · beggeth other borwe,
  But ever worthe hem wel · that doth thee moche sorwe.'
  After that abbot · than spak another,
  'I wold thin heed were of · though thou were my brother!
  Alle that thee borwe · foule mot hem falle!'                 485
  Thus they seyden alle · that weren in the halle.
  Than seyde a priour · yvel mot he thryve!
  'It is moche scathe, boy · that thou art on lyve.'
  'Ow!' seyde Gamelyn · 'so brouke I my bon!
  Now I have aspyed · that freendes have I non.                490
  Cursed mot he worthe · bothe fleisch and blood,
  That ever do priour · or abbot ony good!'
  Adam the spencer · took up the cloth,
  And loked on Gamelyn · and say that he was wroth;
  Adam on the pantrye · litel he thoughte,                     495
  But two goode staves · to halle-dore he broughte,
  Adam loked on Gamelyn · and he was war anoon,
  And caste awey the feteres · and he bigan to goon:
  Tho he com to Adam · he took that oo staf,
  And bigan to worche · and goode strokes yaf.                 500
  Gamelyn cam in-to the halle · and the spencer bothe,
  And loked hem aboute · as they had be wrothe;
  Gamelyn sprengeth holy-water · with an oken spire,
  That some that stoode upright · fellen in the fire.
  There was no lewed man · that in the halle stood,            505
  That wolde do Gamelyn · eny thing but good,
  But stood bisyden · and leet hem bothe werche,
  For they hadde no rewthe · of men of holy cherche;
  Abbot or priour · monk or chanoun,
  That Gamelyn overtok · anon they yeeden doun.                510
  Ther was non of hem alle · that with his staf mette,
  That he ne made him overthrowe · and quitte him his dette.
  'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam · 'for seynte Charite,
  Pay large liverey · for the love of me,
  [658]
  And I wil kepe the dore · so ever here I masse!              515
  Er they ben assoyled · there shal noon passe.'
  'Dowt thee nought,' seyde Gamelyn · 'whyl we ben in-feere,
  Kep thou wel the dore · and I wol werche heere;
  Stere thee, good Adam · and lat ther noon flee,
  And we schul telle largely · how many that ther be.'         520
  'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam · 'do hem but good;
  They ben men of holy chirche · draw of hem no blood,
  Save wel the croune · and do hem non harmes,
  But brek bothe her legges · and siththen here armes.'
  Thus Gamelyn and Adam · wroughte right fast,                 525
  And pleyden with the monkes · and made hem agast.
  Thider they come ryding · Iolily with swaynes,
  And hom ayen they were y-lad · in cartes and in waynes.
  Tho they hadden al y-don · than seyde a gray frere,
  'Allas! sire abbot · what dide we now heere?                 530
  Tho that we comen hider · it was a cold reed,
  Us hadde ben better at home · with water and with breed.'
  Whyl Gamelyn made ordres · of monkes and frere,
  Ever stood his brother · and made foul chere;
  Gamelyn up with his staf · that he wel knew,                 535
  And gerte him in the nekke · that he overthrew;
  A litel above the girdel · the rigge-bon to-barst;
  And sette him in the feteres · ther he sat arst.
  'Sitte ther, brother' · sayde Gamelyn,
  'For to colen thy blood · as I dide myn.'                    540
  As swithe as they hadde · y-wroken hem on here foon,
  They askeden watir · and wisschen anoon,
  What some for here love · and some for here awe,
  Alle the servants served hem · of the beste lawe.
  The scherreve was thennes · but a fyve myle,                 545
  And al was y-told him · in a litel whyle,
  How Gamelyn and Adam · had doon a sory rees,
  Bounden and y-wounded men · ayein the kinges pees;
  Tho bigan sone · stryf for to wake,
  And the scherref was aboute · Gamelyn for to take.           550

  Four and twenty yonge men · that heelden hem ful bolde,
  Come to the schirref · and seyde that they wolde

  They hyeden faste · wold they nought bilinne,
  Til they come to the gate · ther Gamelyn was inne.
  They knokked on the gate · the porter was ny,
  And loked out at an hol · as man that was sly.               560
  The porter hadde biholde · hem a litel whyle,
  He loved wel Gamelyn · and was adrad of gyle,
  And leet the wicket stonden · y-steke ful stille,
  And asked hem withoute · what was here wille.
  For al the grete company · thanne spak but oon,              565
  'Undo the gate, porter · and lat us in goon.'
  Than seyde the porter · 'so brouke I my chin,
  Ye schul sey your erand · er ye comen in.'
  'Sey to Gamelyn and Adam · if here wille be,
  We wil speke with hem · wordes two or thre.'                 570
  'Felaw,' seyde the porter · 'stond there stille,
  And I wil wende to Gamelyn · to witen his wille.'
  In wente the porter · to Gamelyn anoon,
  And seyde, 'Sir, I warne you · her ben come your foon;
  The scherreves meyne · ben atte gate,                        575
  For to take you bothe · schulle ye nat scape.'
  'Porter,' seyde Gamelyn ·  'so moot I wel thee!
  I wil allowe thee thy wordes · whan I my tyme see;
  Go agayn to the yate · and dwel with hem a whyle,
  And thou schalt see right sone · porter, a gyle.             580

  We have foo-men atte gate · and frendes never oon;
  It ben the schirrefes men · that hider ben y-come,
  They ben swore to-gidere · that we schul be nome.'
  'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam · 'hye thee right blyve,               585
  And if I faile thee this day · evel mot I thryve!
  And we schul so welcome · the scherreves men,
  That some of hem schul make · here beddes in the fen.'
  Atte posterne-gate · Gamelyn out wente,
  And a good cart-staf · in his hand he hente;                 590
  Adam hente sone · another gret staf
  For to helpe Gamelyn · and goode strokes yaf.
  Adam felde tweyne · and Gamelyn felde three,
  The other setten feet on erthe · and bigonne flee.
  'What?' seyde Adam · 'so ever here I masse!                  595
  I have a draught of good wyn! · drink er ye passe!'
  'Nay, by god!' sayde thay · 'thy drink is not good,
  It wolde make mannes brayn · to lyen in his hood.'

  And seih the scherreve come · with a gret route.             600
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'what be now thy reedes?
  Here cometh the scherreve · and wil have cure heedes.'

    Lete we now this false knight · lyen in his care,          615
  And talke we of Gamelyn · and loke how he fare.
  Gamelyn in-to the woode · stalkede stille,
  And Adam the spenser · lykede ful ille;
  Adam swor to Gamelyn · by seynt Richer,
  'Now I see it is mery · to be a spencer,                     620
  That lever me were · keyes for to bere,
  Than walken in this wilde woode · my clothes to tere.'
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'dismaye thee right nought;
  Many good mannes child · in care is y-brought.'
  And as they stoode talking · bothen in-feere,                625
  Adam herd talking of men · and neyh, him thought, they were.
  Tho Gamelyn under the woode · lokede aright,
  Sevene score of yonge men · he saugh wel a-dight;
  Alle satte atte mete · in compas aboute.
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'now have we no doute,               630
  After bale cometh boote · thurgh grace of god almight;
  Me thinketh of mete and drink · that I have a sight.'
  Adam lokede tho · under woode-bowgh,
  And whan he seyh mete · he was glad y-nough;
  For he hopede to god · for to have his deel,                 635
  And he was sore alonged · after a good meel.
  As he seyde that word · the mayster outlawe
  Saugh Gamelyn and Adam · under woode-schawe.
  'Yonge men,' seyde the maister · 'by the goode roode,
  I am war of gestes · god sende us non but goode;             640
  [661]
  Yonder ben two yonge men · wonder wel a-dight,
  And paraventure ther ben mo · who-so lokede aright.
  Ariseth up, ye yonge men · and fetteth hem to me;
  It is good that we witen · what men they be.'
  Up ther sterten sevene · fro the diner,                      645
  And metten with Gamelyn · and Adam spenser.
  Whan they were neyh hem · than seyde that oon,
  'Yeldeth up, yonge men · your bowes and your floon.'
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · that yong was of elde,
  'Moche sorwe mot he have · that to you hem yelde!            650
  I curse non other · but right my-selve;
  They ye fette to yow fyve · thanne ye be twelve!'
  Tho they herde by his word · that might was in his arm,
  Ther was non of hem alle · that wolde do him harm,
  But sayde unto Gamelyn · mildely and stille,                 655
  'Com afore our maister · and sey to him thy wille.'
  'Yonge men,' sayde Gamelyn · 'by your lewte,
  What man is your maister · that ye with be?'
  Alle they answerde · withoute lesing,
  'Oure maister is y-crouned · of outlawes king.'              660
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'go-we in Cristes name;
  He may neyther mete nor drink · werne us, for schame.
  If that he be hende · and come of gentil blood,
  He wol yeve us mete and drink · and doon us som good.'
  'By seynt Iame!' seyde Adam · 'what harm that I gete,        665
  I wil auntre to the dore · that I hadde mete.'
  Gamelyn and Adam · wente forth in-feere,
  And they grette the maister · that they founde there.
  Than seide the maister · king of outlawes,
  'What seeke ye, yonge men · under woode-schawes?'            670
  Gamelyn answerde · the king with his croune,
  'He moste needes walke in woode · that may not walke in towne.
  Sire, we walke not heer · noon harm for to do,
  But-if we meete with a deer · to scheete ther-to,
  As men that ben hungry · and mow no mete finde,              675
  And ben harde bistad · under woode-linde.'
  Of Gamelynes wordes · the maister hadde routhe,
  And seyde, 'ye schal have y-nough · have god my trouthe!'
  He bad hem sitte ther adoun · for to take reste;
  And bad hem ete and drinke · and that of the beste.          680
  As they sete and eeten · and dronke wel and fyn,
  [662]
  Than seyde that oon to that other  · 'this is Gamelyn.'
  Tho was the maister outlawe  · in-to counseil nome,
  And told how it was Gamelyn  · that thider was y-come.
  Anon as he herde  · how it was bifalle,                      685
  He made him maister under him  · over hem alle.
  Within the thridde wyke  · him com tyding,
  To the maister outlawe  · that tho was her king,
  That he schulde come hom  · his pees was y-mad;
  And of that goode tyding  · he was tho ful glad.             690
  Tho seyde he to his yonge men  · 'soth for to telle,
  Me ben comen tydinges  · I may no lenger dwelle.'
  Tho was Gamelyn anon  · withoute tarying,
  Maad maister outlawe  · and crouned here king.

    Gamelyn hath a brother · that highte sir Ote,
  As good a knight and hende · as mighte gon on foote.
  Anon ther yede a messager · to that goode knight,
  And tolde him al-togidere · how Gamelyn was dight.           730
  Anon as sire Ote herde · how Gamelyn was a-dight,
  He was wonder sory · was he no-thing light,
  And leet sadle a steede · and the way he nam,
  And to his tweyne bretheren · anon-right he cam.
  'Sire,' seyde sire Ote · to the scherreve tho,               735
  'We ben but three bretheren · schul we never be mo;
  And thou hast y-prisoned · the beste of us alle;
  Swich another brother · yvel mot him bifalle!'
  'Sire Ote,' seide the false knight · 'lat be thy curs;

  To the kinges prisoun · anon he is y-nome,
  And ther he schal abyde · til the Iustice come.'
  'Parde!' seyde sir Ote · 'better it schal be;
  I bidde him to maynpris · that thou graunte him me
  Til the nexte sitting · of deliveraunce,                     745
  And thanne lat Gamelyn · stande to his chaunce.'
  'Brother, in swich a forward · I take him to thee;

  But-if he be redy · whan the Iustice sitte,
  Thou schalt bere the Iuggement · for al thy grete witte.'    750
  'I graunte wel,' seide sir Ote · 'that it so be.
  Let deliver him anon · and tak him to me.'
  Tho was Gamelyn delivered · to sire Ote his brother,
  And that night dwellede · that on with that other.
  On the morn seyde Gamelyn · to sire Ote the hende,           755
  'Brother,' he seide, 'I moot · for sothe, from thee wende,
  To loke how my yonge men · leden here lyf,

  'By god!' seyde sire Ote · 'that is a cold reed,
  Now I see that al the cark · schal fallen on myn heed;       760
  For when the Iustice sitte · and thou be nought y-founde,
  [664]
  I schal anon be take · and in thy stede y-bounde.'
  'Brother,' sayde Gamelyn · 'dismaye thee nought,
  For by seint Iame in Gales · that many man hath sought,
  If that god almighty · holde my lyf and wit,                 765

    Litheth, and lesteneth · and holdeth you stille,
  And ye schul here how Gamelyn · hadde al his wille.          770
  Gamelyn wente ayein · under woode-rys,
  And fond there pleying · yonge men of prys.
  Tho was yong Gamelyn · glad and blithe y-nough,
  Whan he fond his mery men · under woode-bough.
  Gamelyn and his men · talkeden in-feere,                     775
  And they hadde good game · here maister to heere;
  They tolden him of aventures · that they hadde founde,
  And Gamelyn hem tolde ayein · how he was fast y-bounde.
  Whyl Gamelyn was outlawed · hadde he no cors;
  There was no man that for him · ferde the wors,              780
  But abbotes and priours · monk and chanoun;
  On hem left he no-thing · whan he mighte hem nom.
  Whyl Gamelyn and his men · made merthes ryve,
  The false knight his brother · yvel mot he thryve!
  For he was fast aboute · bothe day and other,                785
  For to hyre the quest · to hangen his brother.
  Gamelyn stood on a day · and, as he biheeld
  The woodes and the schawes · in the wilde feeld,
  He thoughte on his brother · how he him beheet
  That he wolde be redy · whan the Iustice seet;               790
  He thoughte wel that he wolde · withoute delay,
  Come afore the Iustice · to kepen his day,
  And seide to his yonge men · 'dighteth you yare,
  For whan the Iustice sitte · we moote be thare,
  For I am under borwe · til that I come,                      795
  And my brother for me · to prisoun schal be nome.'
  'By seint Iame!' seyde his yonge men · 'and thou rede therto,
  Ordeyne how it schal be · and it schal be do.'
  Whyl Gamelyn was coming · ther the Iustice sat,
  The false knight his brother · foryat he nat that,           800
  To huyre the men on his quest · to hangen his brother;
  Though he hadde nought that oon · he wolde have that other.
  [665]
  Tho cam Gamelyn · fro under woode-rys,

    'I see wel,' seyde Gamelyn · 'the Iustice is set;          805
  Go aforn, Adam · and loke how it spet.'
  Adam wente into the halle · and loked al aboute,
  He seyh there stonde · lordes grete and stoute,
  And sir Ote his brother · fetered wel fast;
  Tho went Adam out of halle · as he were agast.               810
  Adam said to Gamelyn · and to his felawes alle,
  'Sir Ote stant y-fetered · in the moot-halle.'
  'Yonge men,' seide Gamelyn · 'this ye heeren alle;
  Sire Ote stant y-fetered · in the moot-halle.
  If god yif us grace · wel for to doo,                        815
  He schal it abegge · that broughte him ther-too.'
  Thanne sayde Adam · that lokkes hadde hore,
  'Cristes curs mote he have · that him bond so sore!
  And thou wilt, Gamelyn · do after my reed,
  Ther is noon in the halle · schal bere awey his heed.'       820
  'Adam,' seyde Gamelyn · 'we wiln nought don so,
  We wil slee the giltif · and lat the other go.
  I wil into the halle · and with the Iustice speke;
  On hem that ben gultif · I wil ben awreke.
  Lat non scape at the dore · take, yonge men, yeme;           825
  For I wil be Iustice this day · domes for to deme.
  God spede me this day · at my newe werk!
  Adam, com on with me · for thou schalt be my clerk.'
  His men answereden him · and bade him doon his best,
  'And if thou to us have neede · thou schalt finde us prest;  830
  We wiln stande with thee · whyl that we may dure,
  And but we werke manly · pay us non hure.'
  'Yonge men,' seyde Gamelyn · 'so mot I wel thee!
  As trusty a maister · ye schal finde of me.'
  Right there the Iustice · sat in the halle,                  835
  In wente Gamelyn · amonges hem alle.

    Gamelyn leet unfetere · his brother out of bende.
  Thanne seyde sire Ote · his brother that was hende,
  'Thou haddest almost, Gamelyn · dwelled to longe,
  For the quest is oute on me · that I schulde honge.'         840
  'Brother,' seyde Gamelyn · 'so god yif me good rest!
  This day they schuln ben hanged · that ben on thy quest;
  And the Iustice bothe · that is the Iugge-man,
  [666]
  And the scherreve bothe · thurgh him it bigan.'
  Thanne seyde Gamelyn · to the Iustise,                       845
  Now is thy power y-don · thou most nedes arise;
  Thow hast yeven domes · that ben yvel dight,
  I wil sitten in thy sete · and dressen hem aright.'
  The Iustice sat stille · and roos nought anoon;
  And Gamelyn clevede · [a-two] his cheeke-boon;               850
  Gamelyn took him in his arm · and no more spak,
  But threw him over the barre · and his arm to-brak.
  Durste non to Gamelyn · seye but good,
  For ferd of the company · that withoute stood.
  Gamelyn sette him doun · in the Iustices seet,               855
  And sire Ote his brother by him · and Adam at his feet.
  Whan Gamelyn was y-set · in the Iustices stede,
  Herkneth of a bourde · that Gamelyn dede.
  He leet fetre the Iustice · and his false brother,
  And dede hem come to the barre · that oon with that other.   860
  Tho Gamelyn hadde thus y-doon · hadde he no reste,
  Til he had enquered · who was on the queste
  For to deme his brother · sir Ote, for to honge;
  Er he wiste which they were · him thoughte ful longe.
  But as sone as Gamelyn · wiste wher they were,               865
  He dede hem everichone · feteren in-feere,
  And bringen hem to the barre · and sette hem in rewe;
  'By my faith!' seyde the Iustice · 'the scherreve is a schrewe!'
  Than seyde Gamelyn · to the Iustise,
  'Thou hast y-yeve domes · of the wors assise;                870
  And the twelve sisours · that weren of the queste,
  They schul ben hanged this day · so have I good reste!'
  Thanne seide the scherreve · to yonge Gamelyn,
  'Lord, I crye the mercy · brother art thou myn.'
  'Therfore,' seyde Gamelyn · 'have thou Cristes curs,         875
  For, and thou were maister · yit I schulde have wors.'
  For to make short tale · and nought to tarie longe,
  He ordeyned him a queste · of his men so stronge;
  The Iustice and the scherreve · bothe honged hye,
  To weyven with the ropes · and with the winde drye;          880
  And the twelve sisours · (sorwe have that rekke!)
  Alle they were hanged · faste by the nekke.
  Thus ended the false knight · with his treccherye,
  [667]
  That ever hadde y-lad his lyf · in falsnes and folye.
  He was hanged by the nekke · and nought by the purs;         885
  That was the meede that he hadde · for his fadres curs.

NOTES

[1] Not the same MS. as that called 'Harl.' in the foot-notes to Gamelyn.

[2] It only contains the clerk's Tale; see Reliquiae, ii. 68. The Longleat
MS. no. 25, belonging to the Marquis of Bath, contains both the Knight's
Tale and the Clerk's Tale.

[3] i.e. the gen. case of _physice_; 'Magister Artium et Physices' occurs
in Longfellow's Golden Legend, § vi.

[4] Tyrwhitt counts 252_b_ and 252_c_ as 253 and 254; but omits 3155, 3156;
hence, in 3157-3720, the numbering is alike in the Six-text and T. He then
omits 3721, 3722, making a difference of _two_ lines. Wright follows
Tyrwhitt's numbering in Group A, and in B 1-1162.

[5] T. counts B 1982, 1983 as one line; so also B 2002, 2003, and B 2012,
2013, and B 2076, 2077, making a difference of _four_ lines; but, on the
other hand, he expands B 1993 into _three_ lines; hence, on the whole, a
difference of _two_ lines in this portion. See pp. 192, 193, and note to B
1993 in vol. v.

[6] Wright counts the lines as I do, but his numbering is in one place
incorrect; after the line which he calls 15260, he counts the next thirteen
lines as ten.

[7] As in the Six-text, I call each clause of Melibeus between the sloping
marks _a line_, and so number it. So also in the Parson's Tale.

[8] T. cuts up the Tale into paragraphs. So also in the Parson's Tale
(Group I). I have _numbered_ these, for convenience; see head-lines, pp.
199-240.

[9] Sixteen lines short in Wright, because the Epilogue to the Nonne
Prestes Tale (see p. 289) is relegated to a footnote.

[10] Twelve lines short; T. omits E 1305-6, F 671-2, 1455-6, 1493-8. Wright
keeps E 1305-6, but does not count them, and omits the other ten.

[11] The dash (--) shews where the Groups end or are interrupted.

[12] The order of the divisions of this tale is different. The 'modern
instances,' viz. Peter of Spain, Peter of Cyrus, Barnabo of Lombardy, and
Ugolino of Pisa are placed at the end instead of coming in the middle.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSE OF FAME


§ 1. It is needless to say that this Poem is genuine, as Chaucer himself
claims it twice over; once in his Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, l.
417, and again by the insertion in the poem itself of the name _Geffrey_
(l. 729)[1].

§ 2. INFLUENCE OF DANTE. The influence of Dante is here very marked, and
has been thoroughly discussed by Rambeau in Englische Studien, iii. 209, in
an article far too important to be neglected. I can only say here that the
author points out both general and particular likenesses between the two
poems. In general, both are visions; both are in three books; in both, the
authors seek abstraction from surrounding troubles by venturing into the
realm of imagination. As Dante is led by Vergil, so Chaucer is upborne by
an eagle. Dante begins his third book, Il Paradiso, with an invocation to
Apollo, and Chaucer likewise begins his third book with the same; moreover,
Chaucer's invocation is little more than a translation of Dante's.

Among the particular resemblances, we may notice the method of commencing
each division of the Poem with an invocation[2]. Again, both poets mark the
exact date of commencing their poems; Dante descended into the Inferno on
Good Friday, 1300 (Inf. xxi. 112); Chaucer began his work on the 10th of
December, the year being, probably, 1383 (see note to l. 111).

Chaucer sees the desert of Lybia (l. 488), corresponding to similar waste
spaces mentioned by Dante; see note to l. 482. Chaucer's eagle is also
Dante's eagle; see note to l. 500. Chaucer gives an account of Phaethon (l.
942) and of Icarus (l. 920), much like those given by Dante (Inf. xvii.
107, 109); both accounts, however, may have been taken from Ovid[3].
Chaucer's account of the eagle's lecture to him (l. 729) resembles Dante's
Paradiso, i. 109-117. Chaucer's steep rock of ice (l. 1130) corresponds to
Dante's steep rock (Purg. iii. 47). If Chaucer cannot describe all the
beauty of the House of Fame (l. 1168), Dante is equally unable to describe
Paradise (Par. i. 6). Chaucer copies from Dante his description of Statius,
and follows his mistake in saying that he was born at Toulouse; see note to
l. 1460. The description of the house of Rumour is also imitated from
Dante; see note to l. 2034. Chaucer's error of making Marsyas a female
arose from his misunderstanding the Italian form Marsia in Dante; see note
to l. 1229.

These are but some of the points discussed in Rambeau's article; it is
difficult to give, in a summary, a just idea of the careful way in which
the resemblances between these two great poets are pointed out. I am quite
aware that many of the alleged parallel passages are too trivial to be
relied upon, and that the author's case would have been strengthened,
rather than weakened, by several judicious omissions; but we may fairly
accept the conclusion, that Chaucer is more indebted to Dante in this poem
than in any other; perhaps more than in all his other works put together.

It is no longer possible to question Chaucer's knowledge of Italian; and it
is useless to search for the original of The House of Fame in Provençal
literature, as Warton vaguely suggests that we should do (see note to l.
1928). At the same time, I can see no help to be obtained from a perusal of
Petrarch's Trionfo della Fama, to which some refer us.

§ 3. TESTIMONY OF LYDGATE. It is remarkable that Lydgate does not expressly
mention The House of Fame by name, in his list of Chaucer's works. I have
already discussed this point in the Introduction to vol. i. pp. 23, 24,
where I shew that Lydgate, nevertheless, refers to this work at least
thrice in the course of the poem in which his list occurs; and, at the same
time, he speaks of a poem by Chaucer which he calls 'Dant in English,' to
which there is nothing to correspond, unless it can be identified with The
House of Fame[4]. We know, however, that Lydgate's testimony as to this
point is wholly immaterial; so that the discussion as to the true
interpretation of his words is a mere matter of curiosity.

§ 4. INFLUENCE OF OVID. It must, on the other hand, be obvious to all
readers, that the general notion of a House of Fame was adopted from a
passage in Ovid's Metamorphoses, xii. 39-63. The proof of this appears from
the great care with which Chaucer works in all the details occurring in
that passage. He also keeps an eye on the celebrated description of Fame in
Vergil's Æneid, iv. 173-183; even to the unlucky rendering of 'pernicibus
alis' by 'partriches winges,' in l. 1392[5].

I here quote the passage from Ovid at length, as it is very useful for
frequent reference (cf. Ho. Fame, 711-24, 672-99, 1025-41, 1951-76,
2034-77):--

 'Orbe locus medio est inter terrasque, fretumque,
  Caelestesque plagas, triplicis confinia mundi;
  Unde quod est usquam, quamuis regionibus absit,
  Inspicitur penetratque cauas uox omnis ad aures.
  FAMA tenet, summaque domum sibi legit in arce;
  Innumerosque aditus, ac mille foramina tectis
  Addidit, et nullis inclusit limina portis.
  Nocte dieque patent. Tota est ex aere sonanti;
  Tota fremit, uocesque refert, iteratque quod audit.
  Nulla quies intus, nullaque silentia parte.
  Nec tamen est clamor, sed paruae murmura uocis;
  Qualia de pelagi, si quis procul audiat, undis
  Esse solent; qualemue sonum, cum Iupiter atras
  Increpuit nubes, extrema tonitrua reddunt.
  Atria turba tenet; ueniunt leue uulgus, euntque;
  Mixtaque cum ueris passim commenta uagantur
  Millia rumorum, confusaque uerba uolutant.
  E quibus hi uacuas implent sermonibus aures;
  Hi narrata ferunt alio; mensuraque ficti
  Crescit, et auditis aliquid nouus adicit auctor.
  Illic Credulitas, illic temerarius Error,
  Vanaque Laetitia est, consternatique Timores,
  Seditioque repens, dubioque auctore Susurri.
  Ipsa quid in caelo rerum, pelagoque geratur,
  Et tellure uidet, totumque inquirit in orbem.'

A few other references to Ovid are pointed out in the Notes.

By way of further illustration, I here quote the whole of Golding's
translation of the above passage from Ovid:--

 'Amid the world tweene heauen and earth, and sea, there is a place,
  Set from the bounds of each of them indifferently in space,
  From whence is seene what-euer thing is practizde any-where,
  Although the Realme be neere so farre: and roundly to the eare
  Commes whatsoeuer spoken is; Fame hath his dwelling there,
  Who in the top of all the house is lodged in a towre.
  A thousand entries, glades, and holes are framed in this bowre.
  There are no doores to shut. The doores stand open night and day.
  The house is all of sounding brasse, and roreth euery way,
  Reporting double euery word it heareth people say.
  There is no rest within, there is no silence any-where.
  Yet is there not a yelling out: but humming, as it were
  The sound of surges being heard farre off, or like the sound
  That at the end of thunderclaps long after doth redound
  When _Ioue_ doth make the clouds to crack. Within the courts is preace
  Of common people, which to come and go do neuer ceace.
  And millions both of troths and lies run gadding euery-where,
  And wordes confuselie flie in heapes, of which some fill the eare
  That heard not of them erst, and some cole-cariers part do play,
  To spread abroade the things they heard, and euer by the way
  The thing that was inuented growes much greater than before,
  And euery one that gets it by the end addes somewhat more.
  Light credit dwelleth there, there dwells rash error, there doth dwell
  Vaine ioy: there dwelleth hartlesse feare, and brute that loues to tell
  Uncertaine newes vpon report, whereof he doth not knowe
  The author, and sedition who fresh rumors loues to sowe.
  This Fame beholdeth what is done in heauen, on sea, and land,
  And what is wrought in all the world he layes to vnderstand.'

§ 5. DATE OF THE POEM. Ten Brink, in his Chaucer Studien, pp. 120, 121,
concludes that The House of Fame was, in all probability, composed shortly
after Troilus, as the opening lines reproduce, in effect, a passage
concerning dreams which appears in the last Book of Troilus, ll. 358-385.
We may also observe the following lines in Troilus, from Book I, 517-8:--

 'Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce
  Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce.'

These lines, jestingly applied to Troilus by Pandarus, are in the House of
Fame, 639, 640, applied by Chaucer to himself:--

 'Although thou mayst go in the daunce
  Of hem that him list not avaunce.'

Again, the House of Fame preceded the Legend of Good Women, because he here
complains of the hardship of his official duties (652-660); whereas, in the
Prologue to the Legend, he rejoices at obtaining some release from them. We
may also note the quotation from Boethius (note to l. 972). As Boethius and
Troilus seem to have been written together, somewhere about 1380, and took
up a considerable time, and the apparent date of the Legend is 1385, the
probable date of the House of Fame is about 1383 or 1384. Ten Brink further
remarks that the references to Jupiter suggest to the reader that the 10th
of December was a Thursday (see note to 111). This would give 1383 for
beginning the poem; and perhaps no fitter date than the end of 1383 and the
spring of 1384 can be found.

§ 6. METRE. Many of Chaucer's metres were introduced by him from the
French; but the four-accent metre, with rime as here employed, was commonly
known before Chaucer's time. It was used by Robert of Brunne in 1303, in
the Cursor Mundi, and in Havelok. It is, however, of French origin, and
occurs in the very lengthy poem of Le Roman de la Rose. Chaucer only
employed it thrice: (1) in translating the Roman de la Rose; (2) in the
Book of the Duchesse; and (3) in the present poem.

For normal lines, with masculine rimes, see 7, 8, 13, 14, 29, 33, &c. For
normal lines, with feminine rimes, see 1, 2, 9, 15, 18, &c. Elision is
common, as of _e_ in _turne_ (1), in _somme_ (6), in _Devyne_ (14); &c.
Sometimes there is a middle pause, where a final syllable need not always
be elided. Thus we may read:--

 'By abstinencë--or by seknesse' (25):
 'In studie--or melancolious' (30):
 'And fro unhappë--and ech disese' (89):
 'In his substáuncë--is but air' (768).

Two short syllables, rapidly pronounced, may take the place of one:--

 'I noot; but who-_so of_ these mirácles' (12):
 '_By a_visiouns, or bý figúres' (47).

The first foot frequently consists of a single syllable; see 26, 35, 40,
44; so also in l. 3, where, in modern English, we should prefer _Unto_.

The final _e_, followed by a consonant, is usually sounded, and has its
usual grammatical values. Thus we have _think-e_, infin. (15); _bot-e_, old
accus. of a fem. sb. (32); _swich-e_, plural (35); _oft-e_, adverbial (35);
_soft-e_, with essential final _e_ (A.S. _s[=o]fte_); _find-e_, pres. pl.
indic. (43); _com-e_, gerund (45): _gret-e_, pl. (53); _mak-e_, infin.
(56); _rod-e_, dat. form used as a new nom., of which there are many
examples in Chaucer (57); _blind-e_, def. adj. (138). The endings _-ed_,
_-en_, _-es_, usually form a distinct syllable; so also _-eth_, which,
however, occasionally becomes _'th_; cf. _comth_ (71). A few common words,
written with final _e_, are monosyllabic; as _thise_ (these); also _shulde_
(should), and the like, occasionally. Remember that the old accent is
frequently different from the modern; as in _orácles_, _mirácles_ (11, 12):
_distaúnc-e_ (18), _aventúres_, _figúres_ (47, 48): _povért_ (88):
_málicióus_ (93): &c. The endings _-i-al_, _-i-oun_, _-i-ous_, usually form
two distinct syllables.

For further remarks on Metre and Grammar, see vol. v.

§ 7. IMITATIONS. The chief imitations of the House of Fame are The Temple
of Glas, by Lydgate[6]; The Palice of Honour, by Gawain Douglas; The
Garland of Laurell, by John Skelton; and The Temple of Fame, by Pope.
Pope's poem should not be compared with Chaucer's; it is very different in
character, and is best appreciated by forgetting its origin.

§ 8. AUTHORITIES. The authorities for the text are few and poor; hence it
is hardly possible to produce a thoroughly satisfactory text. There are
three MSS. of the fifteenth century, viz. F. (Fairfax MS. 16, in the
Bodleian Library); B. (MS. Bodley, 638, in the same); P. (MS. Pepys 2006,
in Magdalene College, Cambridge). The last of these is imperfect, ending at
l. 1843. There are two early printed editions of some value, viz. Cx.
(Caxton's edition, undated); and Th. (Thynne's edition, 1532). None of the
later editions are of much value, except the critical edition by Hans
Willert (Berlin, 1883). Of these, F. and B., which are much alike, form a
first group; P. and Cx. form a second group; whilst Th. partly agrees with
Cx., and partly with F. The text is chiefly from F., with collations of the
other sources, as given in the footnotes, which record only the more
important variations.

§ 9. SOME EMENDATIONS. In constructing the text, a good deal of emendation
has been necessary; and I have adopted many hints from Willert's edition
above mentioned; though perhaps I may be allowed to add that, in many
cases, I had arrived at the same emendations independently, especially
where they were obvious. Among the emendations in spelling, I may
particularise _misdemen_ (92), where all the authorities have _mysdeme_ or
_misdeme_; _Dispyt_, in place of _Dispyte_ (96); _barfoot_, for _barefoot_
or _barefote_ (98); _proces_ (as in P.) for _processe_, as in the rest
(251); _delyt_, _profyt_, for _delyte_, _profyte_ (309, 310); _sleighte_
for _sleight_ (462); _brighte_[7], _sighte_, for _bright_, _sight_ (503,
504); _wighte_, _highte_, for _wight_, _hight_ (739, 740); _fyn_, _Delphyn_
(as in Cx.), for _fyne_, _Delphyne_ (1005, 1006); _magyk_, _syk_, for
_magyke_, _syke_ (1269, 1270); _losenges_, for _losynges_ (1317), and
_frenges_ (as in F.) for _frynges_, as in the rest (1318); _dispyt_ for
_dispite_ (1716); _laughe_ for _laugh_ (Cx. _lawhe_, 1809); _delyt_ for
_delyte_ (P. _delit_, 1831); _thengyn_ (as in Th.) for _thengyne_ (1934);
_othere_ for _other_ (2151, footnote). These are only a few of the
instances where nearly all the authorities are at fault.

The above instances merely relate to questions of spelling. Still more
serious are the defects in the MSS. and printed texts as regards the sense;
but all instances of emendation are duly specified in the footnotes, and
are frequently further discussed in the Notes at the end. Thus, in l. 329,
it is necessary to supply _I_. In 370, _allas_ should be _Eneas_. In 513,
Willert rightly puts _selly_, i.e. wonderful, for _sely_, blessed. In 557,
the metre is easily restored, by reading _so agast_ for _agast so_. In 621,
we must read _lyte is_, not _lytel is_, if we want a rime to _dytees_. In
827, I restore the word _mansioun_; the usual readings are tautological. In
911, I restore _toun_ for _token_, and adopt the only reading of l. 912
that gives any sense. In 1007, the only possible reading is _Atlantes_. In
1044, Morris's edition has _biten_, correctly; though MS. F. has _beten_,
and there is no indication that a correction has been made. In 1114, the
right word is _site_; cf. the Treatise on the Astrolabe (see Note). In
1135, read _bilt_ (i.e. buildeth); _bilte_ gives neither sense nor rhythm.
In 1173, supply _be_. Ll. 1177, 1178 have been set right by Willert. In
1189, the right word is _Babewinnes_[8]. In 1208, read _Bret_ (as in B.).
In 1233, read _famous_. In 1236, read _Reyes_[9]. In 1303, read _hatte_,
i.e. are named. In 1351, read _Fulle_, not _Fyne_. In 1372, adopt the
reading of Cx. Th. P., or there is no nominative to _streighte_; and in
1373, read _wonderliche_. In 1411, read _tharmes_ (= _the armes_). In 1425,
I supply _and hy_, to fill out the line. In 1483, I supply _dan_; if,
however, _poete_ is made trisyllabic, then l. 1499 should not contain
_daun_. In 1494, for _high the_, read _highte_ (as in l. 744). In 1527, for
_into_ read _in_. In 1570, read _Up peyne_. In 1666, 1701, and 1720, for
_werkes_ read _werk_. In 1702, read _clew_ (see note)[10]. In 1717, _lyen_
is an error for _lyuen_, i.e. live. In 1750, read _To_, not _The_. In 1775,
supply _ye_; or there is no sense. In 1793, supply _they_ for a like
reason. In 1804, 5, supply _the_, and _al_; for the scansion. In 1897, read
_wiste_, not _wot_. In 1940, _hattes_ should be _hottes_; this emendation
has been accepted by several scholars. In 1936, the right word is _falwe_,
not _salwe_ (as in Morris). In 1960, there should be no comma at the end of
the line, as in most editions; and in 1961, 2 read _werre_, _reste_ (not
_werres_, _restes_). In 1975, _mis_ and _governement_ are distinct words.
In 2017, _frot_[11] is an error for _froyt_; it is better to read _fruit_
at once; this correction is due to Koch. In 2021, suppress _in_ after
_yaf_. In 2049, for _he_ read _the other_ (Willert). In 2059, _wondermost_
is all one word. In 2076, I read _word_; Morris reads _mothe_, but does not
explain it, and it gives no sense. In 2156, I supply _nevene_.

I mention these as examples of necessary emendations of which the usual
editions take no notice.

I also take occasion to draw attention to the careful articles on this poem
by Dr. J. Koch, in Anglia, vol. vii. App. 24-30, and Englische Studien, xv.
409-415; and the remarks by Willert in Anglia, vii. App. 203-7. The best
general account of the poem is that in Ten Brink's History of English
Literature.




In conclusion, I add a few 'last words.'

L. 399. We learn, from Troil. i. 654, that Chaucer actually supposed
'Oënone' to have four syllables. This restores the metre. Read:--And Paris
to Oënone.

503. Read 'brighte,' with final _e_; 'bright' is a misprint.

859. Compare Cant. Tales, F 726.

1119. 'To climbe hit,' i.e. to climb the rock; still a common idiom.

2115. Compare Cant. Tales, A 2078. Perhaps read 'wanie.'




INTRODUCTION TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.


§ 1. DATE OF THE POEM: A.D. 1385. The Legend of Good Women presents several
points of peculiar, I might almost say of unique interest. It is the
immediate precursor of the Canterbury Tales, and enables us to see how the
poet was led on towards the composition of that immortal poem. This is
easily seen, upon consideration of the date at which it was composed.

The question of the date has been well investigated by Ten Brink; but it
may be observed beforehand that the allusion to the 'queen' in l. 496 has
long ago been noticed, and it has been thence inferred, by Tyrwhitt, that
the Prologue must have been written _after_ 1382, the year when Richard II.
married his first wife, the 'good queen Anne.' But Ten Brink's remarks
enable us to look at the question much more closely.

He shows that Chaucer's work can be clearly divided into three chief
periods, the chronology of which he presents in the following form[12].

        FIRST PERIOD.

  1366 (at latest). The Romaunt of the Rose.
  1369. The Book of the Duchesse.
  1372. (end of the period).

        SECOND PERIOD.

  1373. The Lyf of Seint Cecile.
        The Assembly of Foules.
        Palamon and Arcite.
        Translation of Boethius.
        Troilus and Creseide.
  1384. The House of Fame.

        THIRD PERIOD.

  1385. Legend of Good Women.
        Canterbury Tales.
  1391. Treatise on the Astrolabe.

It is unnecessary for our present purpose to insert the conjectured dates
of the Minor Poems not here mentioned.

According to Ten Brink, the poems of the First Period were composed before
Chaucer set out on his Italian travels, i.e. before December, 1372, and
contain no allusions to writings by Italian authors. In them, the influence
of French authors is very strongly marked.

The poems of the Second Period (he tells us) were composed after that date.
The Life of Seint Cecile already marks the author's acquaintance with
Dante's Divina Commedia; lines 36-51 are, in fact, a free translation from
the Paradiso, canto xxxiii. ll. 1-21. See my note to this passage, and the
remarks on the 'Second Nun's Tale' in vol. v. The Parlement of Foules
contains references to Dante and a long passage translated from Boccaccio's
Teseide; see my notes to that poem in vol. i. The original Palamon and
Arcite was also taken from the Teseide; for even the revised version of it
(now known as the Knightes Tale, and containing, doubtless, much more of
Chaucer's own work) is founded upon that poem, and occasionally presents
verbal imitations of it. Troilus is similarly dependent upon Boccaccio's
Filostrato. The close connexion between Troilus and the translation of
Boethius is seen from several considerations, of which it may suffice here
to mention two. The former is the association of these two works in
Chaucer's lines to Adam--

 'Adam scriveyn, if ever it thee befalle
  _Boece_ or _Troilus_ to wryten newe.'
                      Minor Poems; see vol. i. p. 379.

And the latter is, the fact that Chaucer inserts in Troilus (book iv.
stanzas 140-154) a long passage on predestination and free-will, taken from
Boethius, book v. proses 2, 3; which he would appear to have still fresh in
his mind. It is probable that his Boethius preceded Troilus almost
immediately; indeed, it is conceivable that, for a short season, both may
have been in hand at the same time.

There is also a close connexion between Troilus and the House of Fame, the
latter of which shows the influence of Dante in a high degree; see p. vii.
This connexion will appear from comparing Troil. v. stt. 52-55 with Ho.
Fame, 2-54; and Troil. i. st. 74 (ll. 517-8) with Ho. Fame, 639, 640. See
Ten Brink, Studien, p. 121. It would seem that the House of Fame followed
Troilus almost immediately. At the same time, we cannot put the date of the
House of Fame later than 1384, because of Chaucer's complaint in it of the
hardship of his official duties, from much of which he was released (as we
shall see) early in 1385. Further, the 10th of December is especially
mentioned as being the date on which the House of Fame was commenced (l.
111), the year being probably 1383 (see Note to that line).

It would appear, further, that the Legend was begun soon after the House of
Fame was suddenly abandoned, in the very middle of a sentence. That it was
written later than Troilus and the House of Fame is obvious, from the
mention of these poems in the Prologue; ll. 332, 417, 441. That it was
written at no great interval after Troilus appears from the fact that, even
while writing Troilus, Chaucer had already been meditating upon the
goodness of Alcestis, of which the Prologue to the Legend says so much.
Observe the following passages (cited by Ten Brink, Studien, p. 120) from
Troilus, bk. v. stt. 219, 254:--

 'As wel thou mightest lyen on _Alceste_
  That was of creatures--but men lye--
  That ever weren, kindest and the beste.
  For whan hir housbonde was in Iupartye
  To dye himself, but-if she wolde dye,
  She chees for him to dye and go to helle,
  And starf anoon, as us the bokes telle.

  Besechinge every lady bright of hewe,
  And every gentil womman, what she be,
  That, al be that Criseyde was untrewe,
  That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.
  Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;
  And gladlier I wol wryten, if yow leste,
  Penelopeës trouthe, and good _Alceste_.'

There is also a striking similarity between the argument in Troilus, bk.
iv. st. 3, and ll. 369-372 (B-text) of the Prologue to the Legend. The
stanza runs thus:--

 'For how Criseyde Troilus forsook,
  Or at the leste, how that she was unkinde,
  Mot hennes-forth ben matere of my book,
  As wryten folk thorugh whiche it is in minde.
  Allas! that they shulde ever cause finde
  To speke hir harm; and, if they on hir lye,
  Y-wis, hem-self sholde han the vilanye.'

I will here also note the fact that the first line of the above stanza is
quoted, almost unaltered, in the _earlier version_ of the Prologue, viz. at
l. 265 of the A-text, on p. 88.

From the above considerations we may already infer that the House of Fame
was begun, probably, in December, 1383, and continued in 1384; and that the
Legend of Good Women, which almost immediately succeeded it, may be dated
about 1384 or 1385; certainly after 1382, when King Richard was first
married. But now that we have come so near to the date, it is possible to
come still nearer; for it can hardly be doubted that the extremely grateful
way in which Chaucer speaks of the queen may fairly be connected with the
stroke of good fortune which happened to him just at this very period. In
the House of Fame we find him groaning about the troublesomeness of his
official duties; and the one object of his life, just then, was to obtain
greater leisure, especially if it could be had without serious loss of
income. Now we know that, on the 17th of February, 1385, he obtained the
indulgence of being allowed to nominate a permanent deputy for his
Controllership of the Customs and Subsidies; see Furnivall's Trial
Forewords to the Minor Poems, p. 25. If with our knowledge of this fact we
combine these considerations, viz. that Chaucer expresses himself
gratefully to the queen, that he says nothing more of his troublesome
duties, and that Richard II. is known to have been a patron of letters (as
we learn from Gower), we may well conclude that the poet's release from his
burden was brought about by the queen's intercession with the king on his
behalf. We may here notice Lydgate's remarks in the following stanza, which
occurs in the Prologue to the Fall of Princes[13]:--

 'This poete wrote, _at the request of the quene_,
  A Legende, of perfite holynesse,
  Of Good Women, to fynd out nynetene
  That did excell in bounte and fayrenes;
  But for his labour and besinesse
  Was importable, his wittes to encombre,
  In all this world to fynd so gret a nombre[14].'

Lydgate can hardly be correct in his statement that Chaucer wrote 'at the
request' of the queen: for, had our author done so, he would have let us
know it. Still, he has seized the right idea, viz. that the queen was, so
to speak, the moving cause which effected the production of the poem.

It is, moreover, much to the point to observe that Chaucer's state of
delightful freedom did not last long. Owing to a sudden change in the
government we find that, on Dec. 4, 1386, he lost his Controllership of the
Customs and Subsidies; and, only ten days later, also lost his
Controllership of the Petty Customs. Something certainly went wrong, but we
have no proof that Chaucer abused his privilege.

On the whole we may interpret ll. 496, 7 (p. 101), viz.

 'And whan this book is maad, yive hit the quene,
  On my behalfe, at Eltham[15] or at Shene,'

as giving us a date but little later than Feb. 17, 1385, and certainly
before Dec. 4, 1386. The mention of the month of May in ll. 36, 45, 108,
176, is probably conventional; still, the other frequent references to
spring-time, as in ll. 40-66, 130-147, 171-174, 206, &c., may mean
something; and in particular we may note the reference to St. Valentine's
day as being _past_, in ll. 145, 146; seeing that _chees_ (chose) occurs in
the past tense. We can hardly resist the conviction that the right date of
the Prologue is the spring of 1385, which satisfies every condition.

§ 2. THE TWO FORMS OF THE PROLOGUE. So far, I have kept out of view the
important fact, that the Prologue exists in two distinct forms, viz. an
earlier and a revised form. The lines in which 'the queen' is expressly
mentioned occur in the later version only, so that some of the above
arguments really relate to that alone. But it makes no great difference, as
there is no reason to suppose that there was any appreciable lapse of time
between the two versions.

In order to save words, I shall call the earlier version the A-text, and
the later one the B-text. The manner of printing these texts is explained
at p. 65. I print the B-text in full, in the lower half of the page. The
A-text appears in the upper half of the same, and is taken from MS. C.
(Camb. Univ. Library, Gg. 4. 27), which is the only MS. that contains it,
with corrections of the spelling, as recorded in the footnotes. Lines which
appear in _one_ text only are marked with an asterisk (*); those which
stand almost exactly the same in _both_ texts are marked with a dagger (+)
prefixed to them; whilst the unmarked lines are such as occur in both
texts, but with some slight alteration. By way of example, observe that
lines B. 496, 497, mentioning the queen, are duly marked with an asterisk,
as not being in A. Line 2, standing the same in both texts, is marked with
a dagger. And thirdly, line 1 is unmarked, because it is slightly altered.
A. has here the older expression 'A thousand _sythes_,' whilst B. has the
more familiar 'A thousand _tymes_.'

The fact that A. is older than B. cannot perhaps be absolutely proved
without a long investigation. But all the conditions point in that
direction. In the first place, it occurs in only _one_ MS., viz. MS. C.,
whilst all the others give the B-text; and it is more likely that a revised
text should be multiplied than that a first draft should be. Next, this MS.
C. is of high value and great importance, being quite the best MS., as
regards age, of the whole set; and it is a fortunate thing that the A-text
has been preserved at all. And lastly, the internal evidence tends, in my
opinion, to shew that B. can be more easily evolved from A. than
conversely. I am not aware that any one has ever doubted this result.

We may easily see that the A-text is, on the whole, more general and vague,
whilst the B-text is more particular in its references. The impression left
on my mind by the perusal of the two forms of the Prologue is that Chaucer
made immediate use of the comparative liberty accorded to him on the 17th
of February, 1385, to plan a new poem, in an entirely new metre, and in the
new form of a succession of tales. He decided, further, that the tales
should relate to women famous in love-stories, and began by writing the
tale of Cleopatra, which is specially mentioned in B. 566 (and A. 542)[16].
The idea then occurred to him of writing a preface or Prologue, which would
afford him the double opportunity of justifying and explaining his design,
and of expressing his gratitude for his attainment of greater leisure.
Having done this, he was not wholly satisfied with it; he thought the
expression of gratitude did not come out with sufficient clearness, at
least with regard to the person to whom he owed the greatest debt. So he at
once set about to amend and alter it; the first draught, of which he had no
reason to be ashamed, being at the same time preserved. And we may be sure
that the revision was made almost immediately; he was not the man to take
up a piece of work again after the first excitement of it had passed
away[17]. On the contrary, he used to form larger plans than he could well
execute, and leave them unfinished when he grew tired of them. I therefore
propose to assign the conjectural date of the spring of 1385 to both forms
of the Prologue; and I suppose that Chaucer went on with one tale of the
series after another during the summer and latter part of the same year
till he grew tired of the task, and at last gave it up in the middle of a
sentence. An expression of doubt as to the completion of the task already
appears in l. 2457.

§ 3. COMPARISON OF THE TWO FORMS OF THE PROLOGUE. A detailed comparison of
the two forms of the Prologue would extend to a great length. I merely
point out some of the more remarkable variations.

The first _distinct_ note of difference that calls for notice is at line A.
89 (B. 108), p. 72, where the line--

 'When passed was almost the month of May'

is altered to--

 'And this was now the firste morwe of May.'

This is clearly done for the sake of greater definiteness, and because of
the association of the 1st of May with certain national customs expressive
of rejoicing. It is emphasized by the statements in B. 114 as to the exact
position of the sun (see note to the line). In like manner the vague
expression about 'the Ioly tyme of May' in A. 36 is exchanged for the more
exact--'whan that the month of May Is comen'; B. 36. In the B-text, the
date is definitely fixed; in ll. 36-63 we learn what he _usually_ did on
the recurrence of the May-season; in ll. 103-124, we have his (supposed)
actual rising at the dawn of May-day; then the manner in which he spent
that day (ll. 179-185); and lastly, the arrival of night, his return home,
his falling asleep, and his dream (ll. 197-210). He awakes on the morning
of May 2, and sets to work at once (ll. 578, 579).

Another notable variation is on p. 71. On arriving at line A. 70, he puts
aside A. 71-80 for the present, to be introduced later on (p. 77); and
writes the new and important passage contained in B. 83-96 (p. 71). The
lady whom he here addresses as being his 'very light,' one whom his heart
dreads, whom he obeys as a harp obeys the hand of the player, who is his
guide, his 'lady sovereign,' and his 'earthly god,' cannot be mistaken. The
reference is obviously to his sovereign lady the queen; and the expression
'earthly god' is made clear by the declaration (in B. 387) that kings are
as demi-gods in this present world.

In A., the Proem or true Introduction ends at l. 88, and is more marked
than in B., wherein it ends at l. 102.

The passage in A. contained in ll. 127-138 (pp. 75, 76) is corrupt and
imperfect in the MS. The sole existing copy of it was evidently made from a
MS. that had been more or less defaced; I have had to restore it as I best
could. The B-text has here been altered and revised, though the variations
are neither extensive nor important; but the passage is immediately
followed by about 30 new lines, in which Mercy is said to be a greater
power than Right, or strict Justice, especially when Right is overcome
'through innocence and ruled curtesye'; the application of which expression
is obvious.

In B. 183-187 we have the etymology of _daisy_, the declaration that 'she
is the empress of flowers,' and a prayer for her prosperity, i.e. for the
prosperity of the queen.

In A. 103 (p. 73), the poet falls asleep and dreams. In his dream, he sees
a lark (A. 141, p. 79) who introduces the God of Love. In the B-text, the
dream is postponed till B. 210 (p. 79), and the lark is left out, as being
unnecessary. This is a clear improvement.

An important change is made in the 'Balade' at pp. 83, 84. The refrain is
altered from 'Alceste is here' to 'My lady cometh.' The reason is twofold.
The poet wishes to suppress the name of Alcestis for the present, in order
to introduce it as a surprise towards the end (B. 518)[18]; and secondly,
the words 'My lady cometh' are used as being _directly_ applicable to the
queen, instead of being only applicable through the medium of allegory.
Indeed, Chaucer takes good care to say so; for he inserts a passage to that
effect (B. 271-5); where we may remember, by the way, that _free_ means
'bounteous' in Middle-English. We have a few additional lines of the same
sort in B. 296-299.

On the other hand, Chaucer suppressed the long and interesting passage in
A. 258-264, 267-287, 289-312, for no very obvious reason. But for the
existence of MS. C., it would have been wholly lost to us, and the recovery
of it is a clear gain. Most interesting of all is the allusion to Chaucer's
sixty books of his own, all full of love-stories and personages known to
history, in which, for every bad woman, mention was duly made of a hundred
good ones (A. 273-277, p. 88)[19]. Important also is his mention of some of
his authors, such as Valerius, Livy, Claudian, Jerome, Ovid, and Vincent of
Beauvais.

If, as we have seen, Alcestis in this Prologue really meant the queen, it
should follow that the God of Love really meant the king. This is made
clear in B. 373-408, especially in the comparison between a just king (such
as Richard, of course) and the tyrants of Lombardy. In fact, in A. 360-364,
Chaucer said a little too much about the duty of a king to hear the
complaints and petitions of the people, and he very wisely omitted it in
revision. In A. 355, he used the unlucky word 'wilfulhed' as an attribute
of a Lombard tyrant; but as it was not wholly inapplicable to the king of
England, he quietly suppressed it. But the comparison of the king to a
lion, and of himself to a fly, was in excellent taste; so no alteration was
needed here (p. 94).

In his enumeration of his former works (B. 417-430), he left out one work
which he had previously mentioned (A. 414, 415, p. 96). This work is now
lost[20], and was probably omitted as being a mere translation, and of no
great account. Perhaps the poet's good sense told him that the original was
a miserable production, as it must certainly be allowed to be, if we employ
the word _miserable_ with its literal meaning (see p. 307).

At pp. 103, 104, some lines are altered in A. (527-532) in order to get rid
of the name of Alcestis here, and to bring in a more immediate reference to
the Balade. Line B. 540 is especially curious, because he had _not_, in the
first instance, forgotten to put her in his Balade (see A. 209); but he now
wished to seem to have done so.

In B. 552-565, we have an interesting addition, in which Love charges him
to put all the nineteen ladies, besides Alcestis, into his Legend; and
tells him that he may _choose his own metre_ (B. 562). Again, in B.
568-577, he practically stipulates that he is only to tell the more
interesting part of each story, and to leave out whatever he should deem to
be tedious. This proviso was eminently practical and judicious.

§ 4. THE SUBJECT OF THE LEGEND. We learn, from B. 241, 283, that Chaucer
saw in his vision Alcestis and nineteen other ladies, and from B. 557, that
he was to commemorate them all in his Legend, beginning with Cleopatra
(566) and ending with Alcestis (549, 550). As to the names of the nineteen,
they are to be found in his Balade (555).

Upon turning to the Balade (p. 83), the names actually mentioned include
some which are hardly admissible. For example, Absalom and Jonathan are
names of men; Esther is hardly a suitable subject, whilst Ysoult belongs to
a romance of medieval times. (Cf. A. 275, p. 88.) The resulting practicable
list is thus reduced to the following, viz. Penelope, Marcia, Helen,
Lavinia, Lucretia, Polyxena, Cleopatra, Thisbe, Hero, Dido, Laodamia,
Phyllis, Canace, Hypsipyle, Hypermnestra, and Ariadne. At the same time, we
find legends of Medea and Philomela, though neither of these are mentioned
in the Balade. It is of course intended that the Balade should give a
representative list only, without being exactly accurate.

But we are next confronted by a most extraordinary piece of evidence, viz.
that of Chaucer himself, when, at a later period, he wrote the Introduction
to the Man of Lawes Prologue (see vol. iv. p. 131). He there expressly
refers to his Legend of Good Women, which he is pleased to call 'the
Seintes Legende of Cupide,' i.e. the Legend of Cupid's Saints. And, in
describing this former work of his, he introduces the following lines:--

 'Ther may be seen the large woundes wyde
  Of Lucresse, and of Babilan Tisbee;
  The swerd of Dido for the false Enee;
  The tree of Phillis for hir Demophon;
  The pleinte of Dianire and Hermion,
  Of Adriane and of Isiphilee;
  The bareyne yle stonding in the see;
  The dreynte Leander for his Erro;
  The teres of Eleyne, and eek the wo
  Of Brixseyde, and of thee, Ladomea;
  The cruelte of thee, queen Medea,
  Thy litel children hanging by the hals
  For thy Iason, that was of love so fals!
  O Ypermistra, Penelopee, Alceste,
  Your wyfhod he comendeth with the beste!
  But certeinly no word ne wryteth he
  Of thilke wikke example of Canacee'; &c.

We can only suppose that he is referring to the contents of his work in
quite general terms, with a passing reference to his vision of Alcestis and
the nineteen ladies, and to those mentioned in his Balade. There is no
reason for supposing that he ever wrote complete tales about Deianira,
Hermione, Hero, Helen, Briseis, Laodamia, or Penelope, any more than he did
about Alcestis. But it is highly probable that, just at the period of
writing his Introduction to the Man of Lawes Prologue, he was seriously
intending to take up again his 'Legend,' and was planning how to continue
it. But he never did it.

On comparing these two lists, we find that the following names are common
to both, viz. Penelope, Helen, Lucretia, Thisbe, Hero, Dido, Laodamia,
Phyllis, Canace, Hypsipyle, Hypermnestra, Ariadne, and (in effect)
Alcestis. The following occur in the Balade only, viz. Marcia, Lavinia,
Polyxena, Cleopatra. And the following are mentioned in the above-quoted
passage only, viz. Deianira, Hermione, Briseis, Medea. We further know that
he actually wrote the Legend of Philomela, though it is in neither of the
above lists; whilst the story of Canace was expressly rejected. Combining
our information, and rearranging it, we see that his intention was to write
nineteen Legends, descriptive of twenty women, viz. Alcestis and nineteen
others; the number of Legends being reduced by one owing to the treatment
of the stories of Medea and Hypsipyle under one narrative. Putting aside
Alcestis, whose Legend was to come last, the nineteen women can be made up
as follows:--

1. Cleopatra. 2. Thisbe. 3. Dido. 4 and 5. Hypsipyle and Medea. 6.
Lucretia. 7. Ariadne. 8. Philomela. 9. Phyllis. 10. Hypermnestra (_all of
which are extant_). _Next come_--11. Penelope: 12. Helen: 13. Hero: 14.
Laodamia (_all mentioned in both lists_). 15. Lavinia: 16. Polyxena[21]
(_mentioned in the Balade_). 17. Deianira: 18. Hermione: 19. Briseis (_in
the Introduction to the Man of Lawe_).

This conjectural list is sufficient to elucidate Chaucer's plan fully, and
agrees with that given in the note to l. 61 of the Introduction to the Man
of Lawes Tale, in vol. v.

If we next enquire how such lists of 'martyred' women came to be suggested
to Chaucer, we may feel sure that he was thinking of Boccaccio's book
entitled De Claris Mulieribus, and of Ovid's Heroides. Boccaccio's book
contains 105 tales of Illustrious Women, briefly told in Latin prose.
Chaucer seems to have partially imitated from it the title of his
poem--'The Legend of Good Women'; and he doubtless consulted it for his
purpose. But he took care to consult other sources also, in order to be
able to give the tales at greater length, so that the traces of his debt to
the above work by Boccaccio are very slight.

We must not, however, omit to take notice that, whilst Chaucer owes but
little to Boccaccio as regards his subject-matter, it was from him, in
particular, that he took his _general plan_. This is well shewn in the
excellent and careful essay by M. Bech, printed in 'Anglia,' vol. v. pp.
313-382, with the title--'Quellen und Plan der _Legende of Goode Women_ und
ihr Verhältniss zur _Confessio Amantis_.' At p. 381, Bech compares
Chaucer's work with Boccaccio's, and finds the following points of
resemblance.

1. Both works treat exclusively of women; one of them speaks particularly
of 'Gode Women,' whilst the other is written 'De Claris Mulieribus.'

2. Both works relate chiefly to tales of olden time.

3. In both, the tales follow each other without any intermediate matter.

4. Both are compacted into a whole by means of an introductory Prologue.

5. Both writers wish to dedicate their works to a queen, but effect this
modestly and indirectly. Boccaccio addresses his Prologue to a countess,
telling her that he wishes to dedicate his book to Joanna, queen of
Jerusalem and Sicily; whilst Chaucer veils his address to queen Anne under
the guise of allegory.

6. Both record the fact of their writing in a time of comparative leisure.
Boccaccio uses the words: 'paululum ab inerti uulgo semotus et a ceteris
fere solutus curis.'

7. Had Chaucer finished his work, his last Legend would have related to
Alcestis, i.e. to the queen herself. Boccaccio actually concludes his work
with a chapter 'De Iohanna Hierusalem et Sicilie regina.'

See further in Bech, who quotes Boccaccio's 'Prologue' in full.

To this comparison should be added (as Bech remarks) an accidental
coincidence which is even more striking, viz. that the work 'De Claris
Mulieribus' bears much the same relation to the more famous one entitled
'Il Decamerone,' that the Legend of Good Women does to the Canterbury
Tales.

Boccaccio has all of Chaucer's finished tales, except those of Ariadne,
Philomela, and Phyllis[22]; he also gives the stories of some whom Chaucer
only mentions, such as the stories of Deianira (cap. 22), Polyxena (cap.
31), Helena (cap. 35), Penelope (cap. 38); and others. To Ovid our author
is much more indebted, and frequently translates passages from his Heroides
(or Epistles) and from the Metamorphoses. The former of these works
contains the Epistles of Phyllis, Hypsipyle, Medea, Dido, Ariadne, and
Hypermnestra, whose stories Chaucer relates, as well as the letters of most
of those whom Chaucer merely mentions, viz. of Penelope, Briseis, Hermione,
Deianira, Laodamia, Helena, and Hero. It is evident that our poet was
chiefly guided by Ovid in selecting stories from the much larger collection
in Boccaccio. At the same time it is remarkable that neither Boccaccio (in
the above work) nor Ovid gives the story of Alcestis, and it is not quite
certain whence Chaucer obtained it. It is briefly told in the 51st of the
Fabulae of Hyginus, but it is much more likely that Chaucer borrowed it
from another work by Boccaccio, entitled De Genealogia Deorum[23], where it
appears amongst the fifty-one labours of Hercules, in the following
words:--

'Alcestem Admeti regis Thessaliae coniugem retraxit [Hercules] ad uirum.
Dicunt enim, quod cum infirmaretur Admetus, implorassetque Apollinis
auxilium, sibi ab Apolline dictum mortem euadere non posse, nisi illam
aliquis ex affinibus atque necessariis subiret. Quod cum audisset Alcestis
coniunx, non dubitauit suam pro salute uiri concedere, et sic ea mortua
Admetus liberatus est, qui plurimum uxori compatiens Herculem orauit, vt ad
inferos uadens illius animam reuocaret ad superos, quod et factum est.'--
Lib. xiii. c. 1 (ed. 1532).


§ 5. THE DAISY. To this story Chaucer has added a pretty addition of his
own invention, that this heroine was finally transformed into a daisy. The
idea of choosing this flower as the emblem of perfect wifehood was
certainly a happy one, and has often been admired. It is first alluded to
by Lydgate, in a Poem against Self-Love (see Lydgate's Minor Poems, ed.
Halliwell, p. 161):--

 'Alcestis flower, with white, with red and greene,
  Displaieth hir crown geyn Phebus bemys brihte.'

And again, in the same author's Temple of Glas, ll. 71-74:--

 'I mene Alceste, the noble trewe wyf ...
  Hou she was turned to a dayesye.'

The anonymous author of the Court of Love seized upon the same fancy to
adorn his description of the Castle of Love, which, as he tells us, was--

 'With-in and oute depeinted wonderly
  With many a thousand daisy[es] rede as rose
  And white also, this sawe I verely.
  But what tho deis[y]es might do signifye
  Can I not tel, saufe that the quenes floure,
  Alceste, it was, that kept ther her soioure,
    Which vnder Uenus lady was and quene,
  And Admete kyng and souerain of that place,
  To whom obeied _the ladies good ninetene_,
  With many a thousand other bright of face[24].'

The mention of 'the ladies good ninetene' at once shews us whence this
mention of Alcestis was borrowed.

In a modern book entitled Flora Historica, by Henry Phillips, 2nd ed. i.
42, we are gravely told that 'fabulous history informs us that this plant
[the daisy] is called _Bellis_ because it owes its origin to Belides, a
granddaughter of Danaus, and one of the nymphs called Dryads, that presided
over the meadows and pastures in ancient times. Belides is said to have
encouraged the suit of Ephigeus, but whilst dancing on the green with this
rural deity she attracted the admiration of Vertumnus, who, just as he was
about to seize her in his embrace, saw her transformed into the humble
plant that now bears her name.' It is clear that the concocter of this
stupid story was not aware that _Belides_ is a _plural_ substantive, being
the collective name of the fifty daughters of Danaus, who are here rolled
into one in order to be transformed into a single daisy; and all because
the words _bellis_ and _Belides_ happen to begin with the same three
letters! It may also be noticed that 'in ancient times' the business of the
Dryads was to preside over trees rather than 'over meadows and pastures.'
Who the 'rural deity' was who is here named 'Ephigeus' I neither know nor
care. But it is curious to observe the degeneracy of the story for which
Chaucer was (in my belief) originally responsible[25]. See Notes and
Queries, 7th S. vi. 186, 309.

Of course it is easy to see that this invention on the part of Chaucer is
imitated from Ovid's Metamorphoses, where Clytie becomes a sun-flower,
Daphne a laurel, and Narcissus, Crocus, and Hyacinthus become,
respectively, a narcissus, a crocus, and a hyacinth. At the same time,
Chaucer's attention may have been directed to the daisy in particular, as
Tyrwhitt long ago pointed out, by a perusal of such poems as Le Dit de la
fleur de lis et de la Marguerite, by Guillaume de Machault (printed in
Tarbe's edition, 1849, p. 123), and Le Dittié de la flour de la Margherite,
by Froissart (printed in Bartsch's Chrestomathie de l'ancien Français,
1875, p. 422); see Introduction to Chaucer's Minor Poems, in vol. i. p. 36.
In particular, we may well compare lines 42, 48, 49, 60-63 of our B-text
with Machault's Dit de la Marguerite (ed. Tarbé, p. 123):--

 'J'aim une fleur, qui s'uevre et qui s'encline
  Vers le soleil, de jour quant il chemine;
  Et quant il est couchiez soubz sa courtine
  Par nuit obscure,
  Elle se clost, ainsois que li jours fine.'

And again, we may compare ll. 53-55 with the lines in Machault that
immediately follow, viz.

 'Toutes passe, ce mest vis, en coulour,
  Et toutes ha surmonté de douçour;
  Ne comparer
  Ne se porroit nulle à li de coulour': &c.[26]

The resemblance is, I think, too close to be accidental.

We may also compare (though the resemblance is less striking) ll. 40-57 of
the B-text of the Prologue (pp. 68, 69) with ll. 22-30 of Froissart's poem
on the Daisy:--

 'Son doulç vëoir grandement me proufite,
  et pour ce est dedens mon coer escripte
  si plainnement
  que nuit et jour en pensant ie recite
  les grans vertus de quoi elle est confite,
  et di ensi: "la heure soit benite
  quant pour moi ai tele flourette eslite,
  qui de bonté et de beauté est dite
  la souveraine,"' &c.

At l. 68 of the same poem, as pointed out by M. Sandras (Étude sur G.
Chaucer, 1859, p. 58), and more clearly by Bech (Anglia, v. 363), we have a
story of a woman named Herés--'une pucelle [qui] ama tant son mari'--whose
tears, shed for the loss of her husband Cephëy, were turned by Jupiter into
_daisies_ as they fell upon the green turf. There they were discovered, one
January, by Mercury, who formed a garland of them, which he sent by a
messenger named Lirés to Serés (Ceres). Ceres was so pleased by the gift
that she caused Lirés to be beloved, which he had never been before.

This mention of Ceres doubtless suggested Chaucer's mention of Cibella
(Cybele) in B. 531. In fact, Chaucer first transforms Alcestis herself into
a daisy (B. 512); but afterwards tells us that Jupiter changed her into a
constellation (B. 525), whilst Cybele made the daisies spring up 'in
remembrance and honour' of her. The clue seems to be in the name Cephëy,
representing _Cephei_ gen. case of _Cepheus_. He was a king of Ethiopia,
husband of Cassiope, father of Andromeda, and father-in-law of Perseus.
They were all four 'stellified,' and four constellations bear their names
even to the present day. According to the old mythology, it was not
Alcestis, but Cassiope, who was said to be 'stellified[27].' The whole
matter is thus sufficiently illustrated.

§ 6. AGATON. This is, perhaps, the most convenient place for explaining who
is meant by Agaton (B. 526). The solution of this difficult problem was
first given by Cary, in his translation of Dante's Purgatorio, canto xxii.
l. 106, where the original has _Agatone_. Cary first quotes Chaucer, and
then the opinion of Tyrwhitt, that there seems to be no reference to 'any
of the Agathoes of antiquity,' and adds: 'I am inclined to believe that
Chaucer must have meant Agatho, the dramatic writer, whose name, at least,
appears to have been familiar in the Middle Ages; for, besides the mention
of him in the text, he is quoted by Dante in the Treatise de Monarchia,
lib. iii. "Deus per nuncium facere non potest, genita non esse genita,
iuxta sententiam Agathonis."' The original is to be found in Aristotle,
Ethic. Nicom. lib. vi. c. 2:--

  [Greek: Monou gar autou kai theos sterisketai]
  [Greek: Agenêta poiein hass' an ê pepragmena.]

Agatho is mentioned by Xenophon in his Symposium, by Plato in the
Protagoras, and in the Banquet, a favourite book with our author [Dante],
and by Aristotle in his Art of Poetry, where the following remarkable
passage occurs concerning him, from which I will leave it to the reader to
decide whether it is possible that the allusion in Chaucer might have
arisen: [Greek: en eniais men hen ê duo tôn gnôrimôn estin onomatôn, ta de
alla pepoiêmena; en eniais de outhen; hoion en tô Agathônos Anthei. homoiôs
gar en toutô ta te pragmata kai ta onomata pepoiêtai, kai ouden hêtton
euphrainei]. Edit. 1794, p. 33. "There are, however, some tragedies, in
which one or two of the names are historical, and the rest feigned; there
are even some, in which none of the names are historical; such is Agatho's
tragedy called 'The Flower'; for in that all is invention, both incidents
and names; and yet it pleases." Aristotle's Treatise on Poetry, by Thos.
Twining, 8vo. edit. 1812, vol. i. p. 128.'

The peculiar spelling _Agaton_ renders it highly probable that Chaucer took
the name from Dante (Purg. xxii. 106), but this does not wholly
suffice[28]. Accordingly, Bech suggests that he may also have noticed the
name in the Saturnalia of Macrobius, an author whose Somnium Scipionis
Chaucer certainly consulted (Book Duch. 284; Parl. Foules, 111). In this
work Macrobius mentions, incidentally, both Alcestis (lib. v. c. 19) and
Agatho (lib. ii. c. 1), and Chaucer may have observed the names there,
though he obtained no particular information about them. Froissart (as Bech
bids us remark), in his poem on the Daisy, has the lines:--

 'Mercurius, _ce dist li escripture_,
  trouva premier
  la belle flour que j'ainc oultre mesure,' &c.

The remark--'ce dist li escripture,' 'as the book says'--may well have
suggested to Chaucer that he ought to give _some authority_ for his story,
and the name of Agatho (of whom he probably knew _nothing more_ than the
name) served his turn as well as another. His easy way of citing authors is
probably, at times, humorously assumed; and such may be the explanation of
his famous 'Lollius.' It is quite useless to make any further search.

I may add that this Agatho, or Agathon ([Greek: Agathon]), was an Athenian
tragic poet, and a friend of Euripides and Plato. He was born about B.C.
447, and died about B.C. 400.

Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, ii. 402) rejects this explanation; but it is
not likely that we shall ever meet with a better one.

§ 7. CHIEF SOURCES OF THE LEGEND. The more obvious sources of the various
tales have frequently been pointed out. Thus Prof. Morley, in his English
Writers, v. 241 (1890), says that Thisbe is from Ovid's Metamorphoses, iv.
55-166; Dido, from Vergil and Ovid's Heroides, Ep. vii; Hypsipyle and Medea
from Ovid (Met. vii., Her. Ep. vi, xii); Lucretia from Ovid (Fasti, ii.
721) and Livy (Hist. i. 57); Ariadne and Philomela from Ovid (Met. viii.
152, vi. 412-676), and Phyllis and Hypermnestra also from Ovid (Her. Ep.
ii. and Ep. xiv). He also notes the allusion to St. Augustine (De Civitate
Dei, cap. xix.) in l. 1690, and observes that all the tales, except those
of Ariadne and Phyllis[29], are in Boccaccio's De Claris Mulieribus. But it
is possible to examine them a little more closely, and to obtain further
light upon at least a few other points. It will be most convenient to take
each piece in its order. For some of my information, I am indebted to the
essay by Bech, above mentioned (p. xxviii).

§ 8. PROLOGUE. Original. Besides mere passing allusions, we find references
to the story of Alcestis, queen of Thrace (432[30], 518). As she is not
mentioned in Boccaccio's book De Claris Mulieribus, and Ovid nowhere
mentions her name, and only alludes in passing to the 'wife of Admetus' in
two passages (Ex Ponto, iii. 1. 106; Trist. v. 14. 37), it is tolerably
certain that Chaucer must have read her story either in Boccaccio's book De
Genealogia Deorum, lib. xiii. c. 1 (see p. xxix), or in the Fables of
Hyginus (Fab. 51). A large number of the names mentioned in the Balade
(249) were suggested either by Boccaccio's De Claris Mulieribus, or by
Ovid's Heroides; probably, by both of these works. We may here also note
that the Fables of Hyginus very briefly give the stories of Jason and Medea
(capp. 24, 25); Theseus and Ariadne (capp. 41-43); Philomela (cap. 45);
Alcestis (cap. 51); Phyllis (cap. 59); Laodamia (cap. 104); Polyxena (cap.
110); Hypermnestra (cap. 168); Nisus and Scylla (cap. 198; cf. ll.
1904-1920); Penelope (cap. 126); and Helena (capp. 78, 92). The probability
that Chaucer consulted Machault's and Froissart's poems has already been
discussed; see p. xxxi.

It is interesting to note that Chaucer had already praised many of his Good
Women in previous poems. Compare such passages as the following:--

 'Of Medea and of Iason,
  Of Paris, Eleyne, and Lavyne.'
                    Book of the Duch. 330.

 'By as good right as Medea was,
  That slow her children for Iason;
  And Phyllis als for Demophon
  Heng hir-self, so weylaway!
  For he had broke his terme-day
  To come to her. Another rage
  Had Dydo, quene eek of Cartage,
  That slow hir-self, for Eneas
  Was fals; a! whiche a fool she was!' Id. 726.

        --'as moche debonairtee
  As ever had Hester in the bible.' Id. 986.

 'For love of hir, Polixena-- ...
  She was as good, so have I reste,
  As ever Penelope of Greece,
  Or as the noble wyf Lucrece,
  That was the beste--he telleth thus,
  The Romain, Tytus Livius.' Id. 1071, 1080.

 'She passed hath Penelope and Lucresse.'
                                Anelida; 82.

 'Biblis, Dido, Tisbe and Piramus,
  Tristram, Isoude, Paris, and Achilles,
  Eleyne, Cleopatre, and Troilus.'
                     Parlement of Foules; 289.

 'But al the maner how she [Dido] deyde,
  And al the wordes that she seyde,
  Who-so to knowe hit hath purpos,
  Reed Virgile in Eneidos
  Or the Epistle of Ovyde,
  What that she wroot or that she dyde;
  And, nere hit to long to endyte,
  By god, I wolde hit here wryte.'
                      House of Fame; 375.

The last quotation proves clearly, that Chaucer was already meditating a
new version of the Legend of Dido, to be made up from the Æneid and the
Heroides, whilst still engaged upon the House of Fame (which actually gives
this story at considerable length, viz. in ll. 140-382); and consequently,
that the Legend of Good Women succeeded the House of Fame by a very short
interval. But this is not all; for only a few lines further on we find the
following passage:--

 'Lo, Demophon, duk of Athenis,
  How he forswor him ful falsly,
  And trayed Phillis wikkedly,
  That kinges doghter was of Trace,
  And falsly gan his terme pace;
  And when she wiste that he was fals,
  She heng hir-self right by the hals,
  For he had do hir swich untrouthe;
  Lo! was not this a wo and routhe?
  Eek lo! how fals and reccheles
  Was to Briseida Achilles,
  And Paris to Oënone;
  And Iason to Isiphile;
  And eft Iason to Medea;
  And Ercules to Dyanira;
  For he lefte hir for Iöle,
  That made him cacche his deeth, parde!
  How fals eek was he, Theseus;
  That, as the story telleth us,
  How he betrayed Adriane;
  The devel be his soules bane[31]!
  For had he laughed, had he loured,
  He mostë have be al devoured,
  If Adriane ne had y-be[32]!' &c. Id. 387.

Here we already have an outline of the Legend of Phyllis; a reference to
Briseis; to Jason, Hypsipyle, Medea, and to Deianira; a sufficient sketch
of the Legend of Ariadne; and another version of the Legend of Dido.

We trace a lingering influence upon Chaucer of the Roman de la Rose; see
notes to ll. 125, 128, 171. Dante is both quoted and mentioned by name; ll.
357-360. Various other allusions are pointed out in the Notes.

In ll. 280, 281, 284, 305-308 of the A-text of the Prologue (pp. 89, 90),
Chaucer refers us to several authors, but not necessarily in connexion with
the present work. Yet he actually makes use (at second-hand) of Titus (i.e.
Livy, l. 1683), and also further of the 'epistles of Ovyde.' He takes
occasion to refer to his own translation of the Roman de la Rose (B. ll.
329, 441, 470), and to his Troilus (ll. 332, 441, 469); besides enumerating
many of his poems (417-428).

I. THE LEGEND OF CLEOPATRA. The source of this legend is by no means clear.
As Bech points out, some expressions shew that one of the sources was the
Epitome Rerum Romanarum of L. Annæus Florus, lib. iv. c. 11; see notes to
ll. 655, 662, 679. No doubt Chaucer also consulted Boccaccio's De Claris
Mulieribus, cap. 86, though he makes no special use of the account there
given. The story is also in the history of Orosius, bk. iv. c. 19; see
Sweet's edition of King Alfred's Orosius, p. 247. Besides which, I think he
may have had access to a Latin translation of Plutarch, or of excerpts from
the same; see the notes.

It is worth while to note here that Gower (ed. Pauli, iii. 361) has the
following lines:--

 'I sigh [_saw_] also the woful quene
  Cleopatras, which in a cave
  With serpents hath her-self begrave
  Al quik, and so was she to-tore,
  For sorwe of that she hadde lore
  Antonie, which her love hath be.
  And forth with her I sigh Thisbe'; &c.

It is clear that he here refers to Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, because
he actually repeats Chaucer's very peculiar account of the manner of
Cleopatra's death. See § 9, p. xl. Compare L. G. W. ll. 695-697; and note
that, both in Chaucer and Gower, the Legend of Thisbe follows that of
Cleopatra; whilst the Legend of Philomela immediately follows that of
Ariadne. This is more than mere coincidence. See Bech's essay; Anglia, v.
365.

II. THE LEGEND OF THISBE. This is from Ovid's Metamorphoses, iv. 55-166,
and from no other source. Some of the lines are closely translated, but in
other places the phraseology is entirely recast. The free manner in which
Chaucer treats his original is worthy of study; see, as to this, the
excellent criticism of Ten Brink, in his Geschichte der Englischen
Litteratur, ii. 117. Most noteworthy of all is his suppression of the
mythological element. The story gains in pathos in a high degree by the
omission of the mulberry-tree, the colour of the fruit of which was changed
from white to black by the blood of Pyramus; see note to l. 851. This is
the more remarkable, because it was just for the sake of this very
metamorphosis that Ovid admitted the tale into his series. See also notes
to ll. 745, 784, 797, 798, 814, 835, 869, &c.; and cf. Gower's Confessio
Amantis, ed. Pauli, i. 324.

III. THE LEGEND OF DIDO. Chiefly from Vergil's Aeneid, books i-iv. (see
note to l. 928, and compare the notes throughout); but ll. 1355-1365 are
from Ovid's Heroides, vii. 1-8, quoted at length in the note to l. 1355.
And see, particularly, the House of Fame, ll. 140-382. Cf. Gower, C. A. ii.
4-6[33].

IV. THE LEGENDS OF HYPSIPYLE AND MEDEA. The sources mentioned by Morley are
Ovid's Metamorphoses, bk. vii., and Heroides, epist. vi.; to which we must
add Heroides, epist. xii. But this omits a much more important source, to
which Chaucer expressly refers. In l. 1396, all previous editions have the
following reading--'In Tessalye, as _Ovyde_ telleth us'; but four important
MSS. read _Guido_ for _Ovyde_, and they are quite right[34]. The false
reading _Ovyde_ is the more remarkable, because _all_ the MSS. have the
reading _Guido_ in l. 1464, where a change would have destroyed the rime.
As a matter of fact, ll. 1396-1461 are from Guido delle Colonne's Historia
Troiana, book i. (see notes to ll. 1396, 1463); and ll. 1580-3, 1589-1655
are also from the same, book ii. (see notes to ll. 1580, 1590). Another
source which Chaucer may have consulted, though he made but little use of
it, was the first and second books of the Argonautica of Valerius Flaccus,
expressly mentioned in l. 1457 (see notes to ll. 1457, 1469, 1479, 1509,
1558)[35]. The use made of Ovid, Met. vii., is extremely slight (see note
to l. 1661). As to Ovid, Her. vii., xii., see notes to ll. 1564, 1670. The
net result is that Guido is a far more important source of this Legend than
all the passages from Ovid put together. Chaucer also doubtless consulted
the fifth book of the Thebaid of his favourite author Statius; see notes to
ll. 1457, 1467. Perhaps he also consulted Hyginus, whose 14th Fable gives
the long list of the Argonauts, and the 15th, a sketch of the story of
Hypsipyle. Compare also Boccaccio, De Claris Mulieribus, capp. 15, 16; and
the same, De Genealogia Deorum, lib. xiii. c. 26. Observe also that Gower
gives the story of Medea, and expressly states that the tale 'is in the
_boke of Troie_ write,' i.e. in Guido. See Pauli's edition, ii. 236.

V. THE LEGEND OF LUCRETIA. Chaucer refers to Livy's History (bk. i. capp.
57-59); and to Ovid (Fasti, ii. 721-852). With a few exceptions, the Legend
follows the latter source. He also refers to St. Augustine; see note to l.
1690[36]. Cf. Boccaccio, De Claris Mulieribus, cap. 46, who follows Livy.
Several touches are Chaucer's own; see notes to ll. 1812, 1838, 1861, 1871,
1881.

Gower has the same story (iii. 251), and likewise follows Ovid and Livy.

VI. THE LEGEND OF ARIADNE. From Ovid, Met. vii. 456-8, viii. 6-182; Her.
Epist. x. (chiefly 1-74); cf. Fasti, iii. 461-516. But Chaucer consulted
other sources also, probably a Latin translation of Plutarch's Life of
Theseus; Boccaccio, De Genealogia Deorum, lib. xi. capp. 27, 29, 30; also
Vergil, Aen. vi. 20-30; and perhaps Hyginus, Fabulae, capp. 41-43. Cf.
House of Fame, 405-426; and Gower, ii. 302[37].

VII. THE LEGEND OF PHILOMELA. Chiefly from Ovid, Met. vi. 424-605; and
perhaps from no other source, though the use of the word _radevore_ in l.
2352 is yet to be accounted for. Cf. Boccaccio, De Genealogia Deorum, lib.
ix. c. 8; and Gower, Conf. Amantis, ii. 313, who refers us to Ovid.

VIII. THE LEGEND OF PHYLLIS. Chiefly from Ovid, Her. Epist. ii.; cf.
Remedia Amoris, 591-608. But a comparison with the story as told by Gower
(C. A. ii. 26) shews that both poets consulted some further source, which I
cannot trace. The tale is told by Hyginus (Fab. capp. 59, 243) and
Boccaccio in a few lines. Cf. House of Fame, 388-396. A few lines are from
Vergil, Æn. i. 85-102, 142; iv. 373. And see notes to Lydgate's Temple of
Glas, ed. Schick, p. 75.

IX. THE LEGEND OF HYPERMNESTRA. Chiefly from Ovid, Her. Epist. xiv. But
Ovid calls her husband Lynceus, whereas Chaucer calls him Lino. Again, Ovid
does not give the name of Lynceus' father. Chaucer not only transposes the
names of the two fathers[38], but calls Ægyptus by the name of Egiste or
Egistes. Hence we see that he also consulted Boccaccio, De Genealogia
Deorum, lib. ii. c. 22, where we find the following account: 'Danaus Beli
Prisci fuit filius, ut asserit Paulus[39], et illud idem affirmat
Lactantius, qui etiam et ante Paulum Orosium, dicit Danaum Beli filium ex
pluribus coniugibus .l. filias habuisse, quas cum _Ægistus_ frater eius,
cui totidem erant melioris sexus filii, postulasset in nurus, Danaus
oraculi responso comperto se manibus generi moriturum, uolens euitare
periculum, conscensis nauibus in Argos uenit.... Ægistus autem, quod
spretus esset indignans, ut illum sequerentur filiis imperauit, lege data
ut nunquam domum repeterent, ni prius Danaum occidissent. Qui cum apud
Argos oppugnarent patruum, ab eo diffidente fraude capti sunt. Spopondit
enim se illis iuxta Ægisti uotum filias daturum in coniuges, nec defuit
promisso fides. Subornatae enim a patre uirorum intrauere thalamos singulis
cultris clam armatae omnes, et cum uino laetitiaque calentes iuuenes facile
in soporem iuissent, obedientes patri uirgines, captato tempore
iugulauerunt uiros, unaquaeque suum, _Hypermestra_ excepta, quae _Lino_ seu
Linceo uiro suo miserta pepercit.' We may note, by the way, that Chaucer's
spelling _Hypermistre_ is nearer to Boccaccio's _Hypermestra_ than to the
form in Ovid.

§ 9. GOWER'S CONFESSIO AMANTIS. The relationship of Gower's Confessio
Amantis to Chaucer's Legend has been investigated by Bech; in Anglia, v.
365-371. His conclusion is, that the passages in Gower which resemble
Chaucer are only _three_ at most; and I am here concerned to shew that, in
_two_ of these, the supposed resemblance is delusive.

1. In Gower's introduction, at the very beginning, ed. Pauli, i.4, we are
told that, but for books, the renown of many excellent people would be
lost. This seems to be copied from Chaucer's Prologue to the Legend, ll.
17-28. I have no doubt that such is the case; but we must be careful to
remember that these lines by Gower form part of the prologue _to his second
edition_, and were not written till 1393; by which time Chaucer's lines
were common property, and could be imitated by any one who chose to do it;
so we really learn nothing at all from this comparison.

2. In Gower, i. 45-48, there is a passage which bears some resemblance to
Chaucer's Prologue to the Legend. But if it be considered impartially, I
believe it will be found that the resemblance is too vague to be of any
value, and cannot be relied upon. We really must not set much store by such
generalities as the mention of the month of May; the address of the poet to
Cupid and Venus; the wrathful aspect of Cupid; and the graciousness of
Venus, who bids him disclose his malady and shrive himself. If Gower could
not 'invent' such common poetical talk, he had small business to write at
all. I would rather conclude, that Gower had no opportunity of seeing
Chaucer's poem till somewhat later; for it is a striking fact, that,
whereas Gower seized the opportunity of copying some of Chaucer's phrases
in the Tale of Constance (see this discussed at p. 415), he tells several
of Chaucer's Legends, such as those of Thisbe, Dido, Medea, Lucrece,
Ariadne, Philomela, and Phyllis in a wholly independent manner; and, when
telling the tale of Alcestis (iii. 149), he had no idea that she was ever
transformed into a daisy. Moreover, if he had been able to refer to the
Legend, l. 1355-6, he would hardly have translated 'Maeandri' by 'king
Menander' (ii. 5).

Without hesitation, I dismiss these alleged resemblances as trifling, and
the deduction from them as misleading.

3. But when we come to the _very end_ of Gower's work (iii. 357-367), the
case is entirely altered, and the resemblances are striking and
irrefragable. This is best seen by comparing the whole passage. Gower is in
the midst of lamenting his old age, a subject to which he afterwards
returns, when he suddenly introduces a digression, in which he sees

 'Cupide with his bowe bent;
  And, like unto a parlement
  Which were ordeined for the nones,
  With him cam al the world atones
  Of gentil folk, that whilom were
  Lovers; I sigh hem alle there'....

   'Garlondes, nought of o colour,
  Some of the _lefe_, som of the _flour_,
  And some of grete perles were.'

After which we are introduced to Tristram and Isolde, Jason and Hercules,
Theseus and Phedra, _Troilus and Criseide_ and Diomede, Pyramus, Dido,
Phyllis, Adriane, Cleopatra, Tisbe, Progne and Philomene and Tereus,
Lucrece, Alcestis; and even _Ceyx and Alcyone_ (cf. Chaucer's youthful
poem). The matter is put beyond doubt by Gower's adoption of Chaucer's
peculiar account of Cleopatra's death, as already noted above; see p.
xxxvii.

The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is obvious. We see that, in the
year 1385, Gower had almost completed his long poem, and communicated the
fact to his friend Chaucer; and Chaucer, in return, told him of the new
poem (the Legend) upon which he was then himself engaged, so planned as to
contain nineteen tales or sections, and likely to extend to some 6,000
lines. Moreover, it was written in a new metre, such as no Englishman had
ever employed before. Gower was allowed to see the MS. and to read a
considerable portion of it. He was so struck with it as to make room for
some remarks about it; and even went out of his way to introduce a personal
reference to his friend. He makes Venus say to himself (iii. 374):--

 'And grete wel Chaucer, whan ye mete,
  As _my_ disciple and _my_ poete....
  Forthy now, in his dayes olde[40],
  Thou shall telle him this message,
  That he, upon his later age[40],
  To sette an ende of alle his werke,
  As he, which is myn owne clerke,
  Do make his testament of love,
  (As thou hast do thy shrift above),
  So that my court it may recorde.'

That is to say, Chaucer, being the poet of Venus, is to make his testament
of love, or final declaration concerning love, in a form suitable for being
recorded in the court of the goddess. This 'testament' is, of course, the
Legend of Good Women, in which the martyrs of love are duly recorded; and
their stories, written at the command of Cupid and by way of penance for
what he had missaid against women, were to be placed to the good side of
the author's account with Venus and her son. Moreover, they were finally to
be sent in to the visible representative of the court of Love, viz. to the
queen of England and her court.

It is interesting to observe that Gower, like Chaucer himself at the
moment, regarded this poem as the crowning effort of Chaucer's poetical
career. Neither of them had, at the time, any suspicion that Chaucer would,
after all, 'sette an ende of alle his werke' in a very different manner. We
may thus confidently date the first edition of Gower's Confessio Amantis in
the year 1385, before the Legend of Hypermnestra was abandoned in the
middle of a sentence. The date of the second edition of the same is 1393;
and it is a great help to have these dates thus settled.

§ 10. METRE. The most interesting point about this poem is that it is the
first of the 'third period' of Chaucer's literary work. Here, for the first
time, he writes a series of tales, to which he prefixes a prologue; he
adopts a new style, in which he seeks to delineate characters; and, at the
same time, he introduces a new metre, previously unknown to English
writers, but now famous as 'the heroic couplet.' In all these respects, the
Legend is evidently the forerunner of the Canterbury Tales, and we see how
he was gradually, yet unconsciously, preparing himself for that supreme
work. In two notable respects, as Ten Brink remarks, the Legend is inferior
to the Tales. The various legends composing it are merely grouped together,
not joined by connecting links which afford an agreeable relief. And again,
the Prologue to the Legend is mere allegory, whilst the famous Prologue to
the Tales is full of real life and dramatic sketches of character.

Chaucer had already introduced the seven-line stanza, unknown to his
predecessors--the earliest example being the Compleint unto Pite--as well
as the eight-line stanza, employed in his earliest extant poem, the A. B.
C. For the hint as to this form of verse, he was doubtless indebted in the
first instance to French poets, such as Guillaume de Machault, though he
afterwards conformed his lines, as regarded their cadence and general laws,
to those of Boccaccio and Dante[41].

The idea of the heroic couplet was also, I suppose, taken from French; we
find it in a Complainte written by Machault about 1356-8 (see below, p.
383); but here, again, Chaucer's melody has rather the Italian than the
French character. The lines in Froissart's poem on the Daisy (p. xxxi) are
of the same length, but rime together in groups of seven lines at a time,
separated by short lines having two accents only. Boccaccio's favourite
stanza in the Teseide, known as the _ottava rima_, ends with two lines that
form an heroic couplet[42].

§ 11. 'CLIPPED' LINES. It ought to be clearly understood that the
introduction of the new metre was quite an experiment, for which Chaucer
himself offers some apology when he makes the God of Love say expressly:
'Make the metres of hem as thee leste' (l. 562). Hence it was that he
introduced into the line a variety which is now held to be inadmissible;
though we must not forget that even so great a master of melody as
Tennyson, after beginning his 'Vision of Sin' with lines of normal length,
begins the second portion of it with the lines:--

 'Then methought I heard a hollow sound
  Gathering up from all the lower ground;
  Narrowing in to where they sat assembled,
  Low voluptuous music winding trembled,' &c.

It is precisely this variation that Chaucer sometimes allowed himself, and
it is easy to see how it came to pass.

In lines of a shorter type we constantly find a similar variation. There
are a large number of 'clipped' lines in the House of Fame. Practically,
their first foot consists of a single syllable, and they may be scanned
accordingly, by marking off that syllable at the beginning. Thus, ll.
2117-2120 run thus:--

 'And leet | hem gon. Ther might' I seen
  Weng | ed wondres faste fleen,
  Twent | ty thousand in a route,
  As E | olus hem blew aboute.'

This variation is still admissible, and is, of course, common enough in
such poems as Milton's L'Allegro and Il Penseroso. It is considered a
beauty.

The introduction of two more syllables in lines of the above type gives us
a similar variation in the longer line. If, for example, after the word
_thousand_ in the third of the above lines, we introduce the word _freres_
(dissyllabic), we obtain the line:--

 'Twen | ty thousand freres in a route.'

It is a remarkable fact, that this very line actually occurs in the
Canterbury Tales (Group D, 1695); as I have pointed out in the note to l.
2119 of the House of Fame, at p. 286 below. Persistent efforts have often
been made to deny this fact, to declare it 'impossible,' and to deride me
for having pointed it out (as I did in 1866, in Morris's edition of
Chaucer, i. 174); but I believe that the fact is now pretty generally
admitted. It is none the less necessary to say here, that there is rather a
large number of such lines in the Legend of Good Women; precisely as we
might expect to find in a metre which was, in fact, a new experiment. As it
is advisable to present the evidence rather fully, I here cite several of
these lines, marking off the first syllable in the right way:--

 'That | of all' the flour-es in the med-e'; 41.
 'Suf | fisaunt this flour to preys' aright'; 67.
 'Of | this flour, when that it shuld unclos-e'; 111.
 'Mad' | her lyk a daisie for to sen-e'; 224.
 'Half | hir beautee shulde men nat fynd-e'; 245.
 'With | the whyt-e coroun, clad in gren-e'; 303.
 'Mai | dens been y-kept, for Ielosy-e'; 722.
 'For | to met' in o plac' at o tyd-e'; 783.
 'With | her fac' y-wimpled subtilly'; 797.
 'Both | e with her hert' and with her y-ën'; 859.
 'Bet | ing with his hel-es on the ground-e'; 863.
 'We | that wer-en whylom children your-e'; 901.
 'Been | as trew' and loving as a man'; 911.
 'Had | den in this temple been ov'r-al'; 1024.
 'We | that wer-en in prosperitee'; 1030.
 'Lyk | ed him the bet, as, god do bot-e'; 1076.
 'Lov' | wol lov', for no wight wol hit wond-e'; 1187.
 'Send' | her lettres, tokens, broches, ring-es'; 1275.
 'Mer | cy, lord! hav' pitè in your thoght'; 1324.
 'Twen | ty tym' y-swowned hath she than-ne'; 1342.
 'With | her meynee, end-e-long the strond-e'; 1498.
 'Yift | es gret', and to her officeres'; 1551.
 'Fad | er, moder, husbond, al y-fer-e'; 1828.
 'Fight | en with this fend, and him defend-e'; 1996.
 'Tell | en al his doing to and fro'; 2471.
 'Y | permistra, yongest of hem all-e'; 2575.

It is worth notice that they become scarcer towards the end of the poem.
For all that, Chaucer regarded this form of the line as an admissible
variety, and Hoccleve and Lydgate followed him in this peculiarity. The
practice of Hoccleve and Lydgate is entirely ignored by those to whom it is
convenient to ignore it. Perhaps they do not understand it. The usual
argument of those who wish to regulate Chaucer's verse according to their
own preconceived ideas, is to exclaim against the badness of the MSS. and
the stupidity of the scribes. This was tolerably safe before Dr. Furnivall
printed his valuable and exact copies of the MSS., but is less safe now. We
now have twelve MSS. (some imperfect) in type, besides a copy of Thynne's
first edition of the poem in 1532, making thirteen authorities in all. Now,
as far as this particular matter is concerned, the chief MSS. shew a
wonderful unanimity. In ll. 41, 111, 224, 722, 797, 901, 911, 1076, 1187,
1996, there is no variation that affects the scansion. And this means a
great deal more than it seems to do at first sight. For the scribes of MSS.
A. and T. evidently did not like these lines, and sometimes attempted
emendations with all the hardihood of modern editors. The fact that the
scribes are unwilling witnesses, with a tendency to corrupt the evidence,
makes their testimony upon this point all the stronger. Added to which, I
here admit that, wherever there seemed to be _sufficient_ evidence, I have
so far yielded to popular prejudice as to receive the suggested emendation.
I now leave this matter to the consideration of the unprejudiced reader;
merely observing, that I believe a considerable number of lines in the
Canterbury Tales have been 'emended' in order to get rid of lines of this
character, solely on the strength of the Harleian MS., the scribe of which
kept a keen look-out, with a view to the suppression of this eccentricity
on the part of his author. To give him much encouragement seems
inconsistent with strict morality.

The introduction (ll. 249-269) of a Balade of twenty-one lines makes every
succeeding couplet end with a line denoted by an _odd_ number. The whole
number of lines is 2,723. Dr. Furnivall was the first person who succeeded
in counting their number correctly.

§ 12. DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPTS. The MSS. easily fall into two
distinct classes, and may be separated by merely observing the reading of
l. 1396: see note to that line. MSS. C., T., A. here read _Guido_ or
_Guydo_; whilst MSS. F., Tn., B. read _Ouyde_. MS. P. is here deficient,
but commonly agrees with the former class. Those of the same class will be
described together. Besides this, MS. C. is, as regards the Prologue only,
unique of its kind; and is throughout of the highest authority,
notwithstanding some unpleasant peculiarities of spelling. It is necessary
to pay special attention to it.

The list of the MSS. (including Thynne's edition) is as follows:--

  A.--Arch. Selden B. 24; Bodleian Library (_First class_).

  Add.--Additional 9832; British Museum (_First class_).

  Additional 12524; British Museum (_First class_).

  B.--Bodley 638; Bodleian Library (_Second class_).

  C.--Cambridge Univ. Library, Gg. 4. 27 (_First class_).

  F.--Fairfax 16; Bodleian Library (_Second class_).

  P.--Pepys 2006; Magd. Coll., Cambridge (_First class_).

  T.--Trinity College, Cambridge, R. 3. 19 (_First class_).

  Th.--Thynne's edition, pr. in 1532 (_Second class?_).

  Tn.--Tanner 346; Bodleian Library (_Second class_).

  [alpha].--Additional 28617; British Museum (_First class_); but only a
  fragment, viz. ll. 513-610, 808-1105, 1306-1801, 1852-2110, 2125-2135,
  2151-2723.

  [beta].--Cambridge Univ. Library, Ff. 1. 6 (Thisbe _only_).

  [gamma].--Rawlinson C. 86; Bodleian Library (Dido _only_).

They may be thus described.

C. (Camb. Univ. Lib. Gg. 4. 27) is the famous Cambridge MS., containing the
Canterbury Tales, denoted by the symbol 'Cm.' in the footnotes to vol. iv
(i.e. throughout the Canterbury Tales); also by the symbol 'Gg.' in vol.
i., i.e. in the Minor Poems; see p. 49 of the Introduction to vol. i. It
also contains some other pieces by Chaucer, viz. the A. B. C., Envoy to
Scogan, Truth, Troilus, and the Parlement of Foules. It is of early date,
and altogether the oldest, best, and most important of the existing copies
of the Legend. I shall call all those that resemble it MSS. of the _first
class_.

Its great peculiarity is that it possesses the unique copy of the early
draught of the Prologue; see p. xxi. Upon comparison of it with the Fairfax
MS. (the best MS. of the _second class_), it is found to offer slight
differences in many places throughout the various Legends, besides
presenting large differences throughout the Prologue. The variations are
frequently for the better, and it becomes clear that the first class of
MSS. is of an older type. The second class is of a later type, and differs
in two ways, in one way for the worse, and in another way for the better.
In the former respect, it presents corrupted or inferior readings in
several passages; whilst, on the other hand, it presents corrections that
are real improvements, and may have been due to revision. No doubt there
was once in existence a correct edition of the revised text, but no
existing MS. represents it. We can, however, practically reconstruct it by
a careful collation of MS. C. with MS. F.; and this I have attempted to do.
Throughout the Prologue, I take MS. C. as the basis of the 'A-text,'
correcting its eccentricities of spelling, but recording them in footnotes
wherever the variation is at all important; such a variation as _hym_ for
_him_, or _yt_ for _hit_, I regard as being of no value. At the same time,
I take MS. F. as the basis of the B-text, and correct it, where necessary,
by collation with the rest. Throughout the Legends themselves, I take MS.
F. as the basis of the text, collating it with C. throughout, so that the
text really depends on a comparison of these MSS.; if MS. C. had been made
the basis, the result would have been much the same. It was convenient to
take F. as the basis, because it agrees, very nearly, with all previous
editions of the poem. Unfortunately, leaf 469 of MS. C. has been cut out of
it; and, in consequence, ll. 1836-1907 are missing. The scribe has missed
ll. 1922, 1923, 2506, 2507, in the process of copying.

ADDIT. 9832. This is an imperfect MS., ending at l. 1985, no more leaves of
the MS. being left after that line. Besides this, the scribe has omitted
several lines, viz. ll. 166, 233, 234, 332, 333, 351, 865-872, 960, 961,
1255, 1517, 1744-1746, 1783, 1895, 1945. It belongs to the first class of
the MSS., but is an unsatisfactory copy, and I have not fully collated it.
It confirms, however, several of the readings of this edition, as
distinguished from former editions.

ADDIT. 12524. This also is only a fragment. The first leaf begins at l.
1640 of the poem, from which point it is complete to the end, though ll.
2454-2461 are partially effaced. It belongs to the first class of MSS., but
is a late copy, and I have not fully collated it. It confirms several of my
readings.

T.--MS. Trin. Coll. Cam. R. 3. 19. Denoted by the symbol 'Trin.' in my
edition of the Minor Poems, and described in vol. i., Introd. p. 56. It is
of rather late date, about 1500, but belongs to the first class of MSS. The
scribe has omitted the following lines, viz. 233, 234, 332, 333, 489, 960,
961, 1627, 2202, 2203, 2287-2292, and 2569.

A.--MS. Arch. Selden B. 24 (Bodley). Denoted by the symbol 'Ar.' in my
edition of the Minor Poems, and described in vol. i., Introd. p. 54. A
Scottish copy, written about 1472. It belongs to the first class of MSS.,
but the Scottish scribe sometimes takes liberties, and gives us a reading
of his own. For example, l. 714 becomes:--'As in grete townis the maner is
and wone.' But its readings, on the whole, are good. It alone preserves the
word 'almychti' in l. 1538, which in all the rest is too short; this may
not have been the original reading, but it gives a fair line, and furnishes
as good an emendation as we are likely to get. The scribe has omitted ll.
860, 861, 960, 961, 1568-1571, 2226, and 2227; besides which, one leaf of
the MS. is missing, causing the loss of ll. 2551-2616.

P.--Pepys 2006, Magd. Coll., Cambridge. Denoted by 'P.' in my edition of
the Minor Poems, of which it contains ten. It belongs, on the whole, to the
first class of MSS. The scribe has omitted ll. 232, 437, 623, and 1275.
Besides this, it has lost at least one leaf, causing the complete loss of
ll. 706-776, whilst ll. 777-845 are in a different handwriting. At l. 1377
it breaks off altogether, so that it is only a fragment. It gives l. 1377
in the following extraordinary form:--'And thow wer not fals to oon, but
thow wer fals to twoo'; giving six feet at least to the line, and a
syllable over.

[alpha].--Addit. 28617. A fair MS., but only a fragment, as already noted
(p. xlvii). It confirms many of my readings; as, e.g., in ll. 1995, 2019,
2020, 2199, &c. It varies in l. 1999, but gives there an excellent
reading:--That is nat derk, and ther is roum and space.

[beta].--Camb. Univ. Library, Ff. 1. 6. Contains the Legend of Thisbe only.
A late and poor MS., of small account.

[gamma].--Rawl. C. 86 (Bodleian Library). Contains the Legend of Dido only.
A poor text, with many errors. Yet it seems to be of the first class, and
preserves ll. 960-1. It confirms my readings of ll. 1048, 1074, 1079, 1139,
1144, 1159, 1174, 1195, 1196, 1215, 1366.

F.--Fairfax 16 (Bodleian Library). This is the valuable MS. which contains
so many of the Minor Poems. It is described in my Introd. to the Minor
Poems; vol. i. p. 51. I have taken it as the basis of the edition, though
it was necessary to correct it in all the places where the MSS. of the
first class have better readings. It is the best MS. of the second class,
and Bell's edition does little more than follow it, almost too faithfully,
though the editor professes to have collated with it the MS. A. described
above. The same text, in the main, reappears in the editions by Thynne,
Morris, Corson, Gilman. The scribe is careless, and frequently leaves out
essential words; he also omits ll. 249, 487, 846, 960, 961, 1490[43], 1643,
1693, 1998, part of 2150, 2151, 2152, part of 2153[44], 2193, 2338 (in
place of which a spurious line is inserted in a wrong place), and 2475.
Besides this, the scribe often ruins the scansion of a line by omitting an
essential word in it, as has already been mentioned. Thus in l. 614, he
drops the word _for_, which occurs in all the other MSS. The scribe often
wrongly adds or omits a final _e_, and is too fond of substituting _y_ for
_i_ in such words as _him_, _king_. When these variations are allowed for,
the spelling of the MS. is, for the most part, clear and satisfactory, and
a fair guide to the right pronunciation. Rejected spellings are given in
footnotes as far as l. 924; after which I have made such alterations as are
purely trivial without giving notice. Even in ll. 1-924 I have changed
_hym_ into _him_, and _kyng_ into _king_; and, conversely, _strif_ into
_stryf_, (where the _y_ denotes that the vowel is long), without hesitation
and without recording the change. My text is, in fact, spelt phonetically;
and, after all, the test of a text of Chaucer is to read it with the
Middle-English pronunciation as given by Dr. Sweet in his Second
Middle-English Primer, and to observe whether the result is perfectly in
accord with the flowing melody so manifest in the Canterbury Tales.

B.--Bodley 638. Closely related to MS. F., and almost a duplicate of it,
both being derived from a common source. B. is sometimes right where F. is
wrong; thus in l. 1196 it has _houyn_, where F. has _heuen_. See Introd. to
the Minor Poems, vol. i. p. 53. Of course this MS. belongs, like F., to the
second class. It preserves l. 1693 (missing in F.); otherwise it omits all
the lines that are omitted in F., as well as ll. 157, 262, 623, 1345, 1866;
all of which F. retains. Like F., it has a spurious line in place of l.
2338.

TN.--Tanner 346 (Bodley). This is a MS. of the second class, strongly
resembling F.; see Introd. to the Minor Poems, vol. i. p. 54. It preserves
ll. 1693, 2193, 2475; otherwise it omits all the lines omitted in F., as
well as the latter half of l. 1378 and the former half of l. 1379. It has a
spurious line in place of l. 2338. It is clear that F., B., and Tn. are all
from a common source, which was an older MS. not now known.

§ 13. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINTED EDITIONS. TH.--Thynne's edition; A.D.
1532. This follows, mainly, the MSS. of the second class; its alliance with
F., B., and Tn. is shewn by its containing the spurious form of l. 2338.
But it gives the genuine form also, so that in this place _three_ lines
rime together. It is more complete than any of those MSS., preserving the
lines which they omit (excepting ll. 960, 961), save that it omits ll.
1326, 1327 (doubtless by oversight), which are found in these three MSS.,
and indeed in all the copies. Probably Thynne used more than one MS., as he
sometimes agrees with the MSS. of the first class. Thus, in l. 1163, he
reads _vpreysed had_, as in C., T., A., P., instead of _vp-reyseth hath_,
as in F., Tn., B. He might, however, have corrected this by the light of
nature. In ll. 1902, 1923, Thynne alone gives the right reading _Alcathoe_;
unfortunately, both these lines are missing in MS. C. The chief faults of
Thynne's edition are its omission of ll. 960, 961, 1326, 1327, and its
spurious l. 2338. Thynne was also unfortunate in following, in general, the
authority of a MS. of the second class.

SOME LATER EDITIONS.--Later editions appeared in the collected editions of
Chaucer's Works, viz. in 1542, (about) 1550, 1561, 1598, 1602, 1687; after
which came Urry's useless edition of 1721. Excepting the last, I suppose
the editions are all mere reprints; each being worse than its predecessor,
as is almost always the case. At any rate, the edition of 1561 is a close
reprint of Thynne, with a few later spellings, such as _guide_ in place of
Thynne's _gyde_ in l. 969. This edition of course omits ll. 960, 961, 1326,
1327; and gives the spurious l. 2338.

According to Lowndes, other later editions of Chaucer's Works are the
following:--Edinburgh, 1777; 18mo. 12 vols.--Edinburgh, 1782; 12mo. 14
vols.--In Anderson's British Poets, Edinburgh, 1793-1807; royal 8vo. 13
vols.--In Cooke's British Poets, London, 1798, &c., 18mo. 80 parts.--In
Chalmers' English Poets, London, 1810; royal 8vo. 21 vols. I suppose that
all of these are mere reprints; such is certainly the case with the edition
by Chalmers, which merely reproduces Tyrwhitt's edition of the Canterbury
Tales, and follows 'the black-letter editions' throughout the other poems.
The same remark applies to the edition printed by Moxon in 1855, and
attributed to Tyrwhitt as editor.

Other editions are those by S. W. Singer, London, 1822, fcp. 8vo. 5 vols.;
by Sir H. Nicolas (in the Aldine edition of English Poets), London, 1845,
post 8vo. 6 vols.; and by Robert Bell, London, 1855, 12mo. 8 vols. The last
was really edited by Mr. Jephson.

Bell's (so-called) edition was conveniently reprinted in four volumes, in
Bohn's Standard Library; a revised edition of this was published in 1878,
with a Preliminary Essay by myself. Of the Legend of Good Women, the editor
(Mr. Jephson) remarks that 'the text of the present edition is founded upon
a careful collation of the MS. Fairfax 16, in the Bodleian Library, and MS.
Arch. Seld. B. 24'; i.e. upon a collation of F. with A. It gives us the
text of MS. F., with the missing lines supplied from Thynne or from MS. A.
It omits ll. 960, 961, and inserts ll. 1326, 1327 _in the wrong place_,
viz. after l. 1329. At l. 2338, it gives both the correct and the spurious
forms of the line; so that here (as in Thynne) _three_ lines rime together.
In l. 2150-3, the same confusion occurs as is noticed below, in the account
of Morris's edition. The chief gain in this edition is that it has a few
explanatory notes. Of these I have freely availed myself, marking them with
the word 'Bell' whenever I quote them exactly; though they were really
written, as I am told, by Mr. Jephson, whose name nowhere appears, except
at p. 12 of my Essay, as prefixed to the revised edition.

The Aldine edition was reprinted in 1866, on which occasion it was edited
by Dr. Morris. With respect to the Legend of Good Women, Dr. Morris says
that it is copied from MS. F., collated with MSS. A., C. (privately printed
at Cambridge by Mr. H. Bradshaw, 1864), and MSS. Addit. 9832 and 12524. In
this edition, variations from the MS. (F.) are denoted by italic letters,
but such variations are very few. Practically, we here find a correct print
of MS. F., with most of the missing lines supplied by collation, and with
very few corrections. Lines 960, 961 are, however, still omitted, though
found in MS. C.; but ll. 1326, 1327 (also omitted by Thynne) are duly
given, being found, in fact, in MS. F. At l. 2338, the correct line is
given, but the spurious line is also retained; so that (as in Thynne)
_three_ lines here rime together. In the former part of l. 2153, a part of
l. 2150 is repeated, giving us _by_ instead of _eek_; the fact is that the
scribe slipped from _gayler_ in l. 2150 to _gayler_ in l. 2153, omitting
all that came between these words. Nothing is said about the interesting
form of the Prologue as existing in MS. C. There are no explanatory notes.

Besides the English editions, two editions of the Legend of Good Women have
appeared in America, which demand some notice.

Of these, the former is a very handy edition of the Legend of Good Women,
published _separately_ for the first time, and edited by Professor Hiram
Corson. The text is that of Bell's edition; but the explanatory notes are
fuller and better, and I have carefully consulted them. At the end is an
Index of all the words explained, which really serves the purpose of a
glossary. This is certainly the best edition I have met with.

The other edition is that of Chaucer's Works, edited by Arthur Gilman, and
published at Boston in 1879, in three volumes. The Legend of Good Women
occurs in vol. iii. pp. 79-183. The harder words are explained in
footnotes, and there are just a few notes on the subject-matter. The chief
point in this edition is that the editor quotes some of the more remarkable
variations in the Prologue from MS. C., which he says is 'evidently an
earlier one than the one followed in the text, Fairfax 16, in the Bodleian
Library, Oxford.' Yet his text is a mere reprint from that of Morris; it
omits ll. 960, 961, and gives l. 2338 both in its correct and in its
spurious form. Consequently, it contains 2722 lines instead of 2723. The
true number of lines is _odd_, because of the Balade of 21 lines at l. 249.

The net result is this; that none of the editions are complete, and they
are all _much the same_. After twenty editions, we are left almost where we
started at first. Thynne's edition was founded on a MS. very closely
resembling F., but more complete; still it omits four lines, and gives l.
2338 twice over, in different forms. The same is true of all the numerous
reprints from it. Bell's edition restores ll. 1326, 1327, but in the wrong
place; whilst Morris's edition restores them in the right place. These
lines actually occur in MS. F. (in the right place), and could hardly have
been unnoticed in collating the proofs with the MS. These editions are both
supposed to be collated with MS. A. at least, but the results of such
collation are practically _nil_, as that MS. was merely consulted to supply
missing lines. The editors practically ignore the readings of that MS.,
except where F. is imperfect. Hence they did not discover that MS. A.
_belongs to a different class of MSS., and that it frequently gives earlier
and better readings_. But even A. omits ll. 960, 961, though it also
rightly suppresses the spurious form of l. 2338.

§ 14. SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN MY EDITION OF 1889. No real advance towards a
better text was made till Dr. Furnivall brought out, for the Chaucer
Society, his valuable and exact prints of the manuscripts themselves. This
splendid and important work gives the texts _in extenso_ of all the MSS.
above mentioned, viz. MSS. C., F., Tn., T., A., and Th. (Thynne's ed.) in
the 'Parallel-Text edition of Chaucer's Minor Poems,' Part III; MSS. B.,
Addit. 9832, P., and Addit. 12524, in the 'Supplementary Parallel-Texts,'
Part II; and MSS. [alpha], [beta], [gamma], in 'Odd Texts,' 1880. But for
the invaluable help thus rendered, the edition of 1889 would never have
been undertaken, and I should never have attained to so clear an
understanding of the text. I have already said that Dr. Furnivall was the
_first_ person who succeeded in numbering the lines of the poem correctly;
indeed, most editions have no numbering at all.

I have not thought it necessary to encumber the pages with wholly inferior
readings that are of no value, but I have carefully collated the best MSS.,
viz. C., F., Tn., T., A., B., and sometimes P., besides keeping an eye upon
Th., i.e. Thynne's edition. I thus was enabled to see the true state of the
case, viz. that the MSS. of the first class (C., T., A., P., Addit. 9832,
12524, and 28617) have been practically neglected altogether; whilst, of
the MSS. &c. of the second class (F., Tn., B., Th.), only F. and Th. have
received sufficient attention. It is now abundantly clear that the best
authorities are C. and F., as being of different classes, and that the
right plan is to consult these _first_, and then to see how the other MSS.
support them. A long list of important emendations, and an exposure of the
extreme inaccuracy of most of the previous editions, will be found in the
Introduction to my edition of 1889, and need not be repeated here.

§ 15. CONCLUSION. In conclusion, I may mention the Poem in MS. Ashmole 59,
entitled 'The Cronycle made by Chaucier. ¶ Here nowe folowe the names of
the nyene worshipfullest Ladyes ... by Chaucier.' It is a poor production,
perhaps written by Shirley, and merely gives a short epitome of the
contents of the Legend of Good Women. The words 'by Chaucier' refer to
Chaucer's authorship of the Legend only, and not to the authorship of the
epitome, which, though of some interest, is practically worthless. The
author makes the odd mistake of confusing the story of Alcestis with that
of Ceyx and Alcyone in the Book of the Duchesse (62-230). This 'Cronycle'
was printed by Dr. Furnivall in his Odd-texts of Chaucer's Minor Poems,
Part i.

I have now only to record my indebtedness to others, especially to Dr.
Furnivall for his invaluable prints in the Parallel-Texts; to the excellent
essay by M. Bech, in vol. v. of Anglia[45]; to Mr. Jephson for his notes in
'Bell's' edition; and to the notes in the edition by Professor Corson. Also
to Professor Ten Brink, the second part of whose second volume of the
Geschichte der englischen Litteratur has just appeared (1893).

NOTE.--If the reader finds the _two_ forms of the Prologue troublesome, he
has only to confine his attention to the 'B-text,' in the _lower_ part of
pp. 65-105. The text agrees with that usually given, and contains 579
lines. The first line of 'Cleopatra' is l. 580, the numbering being
continuous. Besides this, the lines of each Legend are given _separately_,
within marks of parenthesis. Thus l. 589 is the 10th line of 'Cleopatra';
and so in other cases.



I here subjoin an Additional Note to lines 1896-8.

At p. xxxix. above (footnote no. 2), I give Bech's reference to Godfrey of
Viterbo. The passage runs thus:--


     '_De Ioue primo rege Atheniensi._

  A Ioue nostrorum uenit generatio regum,
  A Ioue principium recipit descriptio regum,
    A Ioue _philosophi_ dogmata prima legunt.
  Rex erat ex rege quondam patre natus Athenis,
  Indeque quadriuii triuiique scientia uenit;
    Legis et artis ibi rex ydioma dedit.'




INTRODUCTION TO A TREATISE ON THE ASTROLABE.


§ 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE MSS. The existing MSS. of the 'Astrolabe' are still
numerous. I have been successful in finding no less than twenty-two, which
I here describe. It is remarkable that, although many printed editions of
the treatise have appeared, no first-class MS. has ever hitherto come under
the notice of any one of the various editors. This point will appear more
clearly hereafter.

§ 2. A.--MS. Dd. 3. 53 (part 2) in the Cambridge University Library. The
'Treatise on the Astrolabie' begins at fol. 212 of the MS. considered as a
whole, but the folios are now properly renumbered throughout the treatise.
The MS. is of vellum, and the writing clear and good, with a great number
of neatly drawn diagrams, which appear wherever the words 'lo here thi
figure' occur in the text. This MS. I have made the basis of the text, and
it is followed with sufficient exactness, except when notice to the
contrary is given in the Critical Notes.

This MS. is of considerable importance. The handwriting exactly resembles
that in MS. B., and a comparison of these MSS. leads to the following
results. It appears that MSS. A. and B. were written out by the same
scribe, nearly at the same time. The peculiarities of spelling,
particularly those which are faulty, are the same in both in a great many
instances. It is also clear that the said scribe had but a very dim notion
of what he was writing, and committed just such blunders as are described
in Chaucer's Lines to Adam Scriveyn, and are there attributed to
'negligence and rape[46].' It is still more interesting to observe that
Chaucer tells us that he had to amend his MSS. by 'rubbing and scraping'
with his own hand; for MS. A. and B. differ precisely in this point, viz.
that while the latter is left uncorrected, the former has been diligently
'rubbed and scraped' by the hand of a corrector who well knew what he was
doing, and the right letters have been inserted in the right places over
the erasures. These inserted letters are in the hand of a second scribe who
was a better writer than the first, and who was entrusted with the task of
drawing the diagrams. The two hands are contemporaneous, as appears from
the additions to the diagrams made by the writer of the text.
Unfortunately, there are still a good many errors left. This is because the
blunders were so numerous as to beguile the corrector into passing over
some of them. When, for example, the scribe, having to write 'lo here thy
figure' at the end of nearly every section, took the trouble to write the
last word 'vigure' or 'vigour' in nearly every instance, we are not
surprised to find that, in a few places, the word has escaped correction.
It further appears that some of the later sections, particularly sections
39 and 40, have not been properly revised; the corrector may very well have
become a little tired of his task by the time he arrived at them. It must
also be remembered, that such blunders as are made by a scribe who is not
clear as to the meaning of his subject-matter are by no means the blunders
which are most puzzling or most misleading; they are obvious at once as
evident blotches, and the general impression left upon the mind by the
perusal of this MS. is--that a careless scribe copied it from some almost
perfect original, and that his errors were partially corrected by an
intelligent corrector (possibly the author), who grew tired of his task
just towards the end.

The order of the Conclusions in Part ii. differs from that in all the
editions hitherto printed, and the MS. terminates abruptly in the middle of
a sentence, at the words 'howre after howre' in Conclusion 40 (p. 223). A
portion of the page of the MS. below these words is left blank, though the
colophon 'Explicit tractatus,' &c. was added at the bottom of the page at a
later period.

Certain allusions in the former part of the MS. render it probable that it
was written in London, about the year 1400.

§ 3. B.--MS. E Museo 54, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. This is an
uncorrected duplicate of the preceding, as has been explained, and ends in
the same way, at the words 'howre after howre,' followed by a blank space.
The chief addition is the rubricated title--'Bred and mylk For childeren,'
boldly written at the beginning; in the margin are the following notes in a
late hand--'S_i_r Jiffray Chaucer'--'Do_mi_nus Gaufredus
Chaucerus'--'Galfredi Chauceri Tractatus de Ratione et vsu Astrolabij ad
Ludouicum filiu_m_.'

§ 4. C.--MS. Rawlinson, Misc. 1262, otherwise 1370 (leaves 22-42), in the
Bodleian Library, Oxford.

This is a beautifully written MS., on vellum, with 38 pages of text, and 4
blank pages. It has the Conclusions in the same order as the preceding, six
well-executed diagrams, and corrections on nearly every page. It is of
early date, perhaps about A.D. 1420, and of considerable importance. It
agrees closely with the text, and, like it, ends with 'howre after howre.'
Some variations of spelling are to be found in the Critical Notes. In this
MS. the Conclusions are numbered in the margin, and the numbers agree with
those adopted in this edition.

§ 5. D.--MS. Ashmole 391, in the Bodleian Library. I have made but little
use of this MS., on account of its being very imperfect.

§ 6. E.--MS. Bodley 619. This MS., like B., has the title--'Brede and Milke
for children.' Like other good MSS., it ends sect. 40 with 'houre after
houre.' But after this, there occurs an additional section, probably not
genuine, but printed here (for the sake of completeness) as section 46; see
p. 229. Cf. § 17.

At fol. 21 is an additional section, not found elsewhere, which is printed
in the Notes; see p. 360. This Conclusion has some claims to our notice,
because, whether genuine or not, it is translated from Messahala.

§ 7. F.--MS. 424, in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Very
imperfect, especially at the beginning, where a large portion has been
lost.

The Conclusions follow the right order, as in the best MSS.

§ 8. G.--MS. R. 15, 18, in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. This
is a curious and interesting volume, as it contains several tracts in
English on astrology and astronomy, with tables of stars, &c.

The copy of the 'Astrolabe' in this MS. is not a good one. It ends in Part
ii. sect. 34, l. 14. The Conclusions are in the right order, and there are
a few diagrams.

§ 9. H.--MS. Sloane 314, British Museum. A late MS. on paper, absurdly said
in a note to be in Chaucer's handwriting, whereas it is clearly to be
referred to the end of the fifteenth century.

§ 10. I.--MS. Sloane 261. This is an 'edited' MS., having been apparently
prepared with a view to publication. Mr. Brae has made considerable use of
it, and gives, in his preface, a careful and interesting account of it. He
concludes that this MS. was written by Walter Stevins in 1555, and
dedicated by him to Edward Earl of Devonshire; and that MS. H. was one of
those which Stevins especially consulted, because it contains marginal
notes in Stevins' handwriting. The contents of this MS. can be so well
ascertained from Mr. Brae's edition that it is unnecessary to say more
about it here. The Conclusions are arranged in the same order as in other
MSS. that are _not_ of the first class.

§ 11. K.--MS. Rawlinson Misc. 3, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. On
vellum, 49 folios, with rich gold capitals, beautifully ornamented; in a
large clear handwriting, with red rubrics. Title--'Astralabium.'
Begins--'Lityl lowys my sone,' &c.--and ends--'For þe mone meuyth the
contrarie from other planetys. as yn here epicircle. but in none other
maner'; see end of Part ii. sect. 35; p. 217. Order of Conclusions in Part
ii. as follows; 1-12, 19-21, 13-18, 22-35; as in other late MSS. There are
no diagrams, and the MS., though well written, may perhaps be referred to
the latter half of the fifteenth century.

§ 12. L.--MS. Additional 23002, British Museum. A fair MS., on vellum,
without diagrams; imperfect. See description of MS. R. in § 17. And see the
Note on Part ii. sect. 3 (p. 360).

§ 13. M.--MS. E. 2 in the Library of St. John's College, Cambridge. Small
MS. on vellum, without diagrams. The leaves have been misplaced, and bound
up in a wrong order, but nothing is lost. I have printed from this MS. the
last five words of sect. 40; also 41-43, and 41_a_-42_b_; besides collating
it for the improvement of the text in sect. 44; sect. 45 is missing. I have
also been indebted to it for the _Latin_ rubrics to the Conclusions, which
I have not found elsewhere. Several various readings from this MS. appear
in the Critical Notes (pp. 233-241).

§ 14. N.--MS. Digby 72, in the Bodleian Library. From this MS. I have
printed the text of sections 44 and 45 (pp. 226-9), but have made little
further use of it.

§ 15. O.--MS. Ashmole 360, in the Bodleian Library. Late MS., on paper;
former owner's name, Joh_a_n Pekeryng; without diagrams. There are
evidently some omissions in it. But it includes sections 44 and 45, and I
have given various readings from it in those sections (p. 240). It ends at
the end of sect. 43_a_, with the words--'on_e_ to twelfe. _& sic finis_';
see p. 232.

§ 16. P.--MS. Dd. 12. 51 in the Cambridge University Library. Small MS. on
vellum; written in the fifteenth century. The text is by no means a bad
one, though the spelling is peculiar. Some of the pages are very much
rubbed and defaced. I have taken from it some various readings, recorded in
the Critical Notes.

One point deserves particular attention. It not only contains the
Conclusions of Part ii. _in the right order_, but continues it _without a
break_ to the end of Conclusion 43 (p. 225); at the end of which is the
colophon--Explicit tractatus astrolabii.

§ 17. Q.--MS. Ashmole 393, in the Bodleian Library; on paper. Of little
importance.

R.--MS. Egerton 2622, in the British Museum. A neat MS., but without
diagrams. Contains: Part I. (except 15-23); Part II. §§ 1-12, 19-21, 13-18,
22-35, 41-43, 44, 45; 41_a_, 41_b_, 42_a_, 43_a_, 42_b_, 36, 37. Thus it
has all the additional sections except 46; but 38-40 are missing. MS. L.
contains the same sections in the same order; see § 12.

S.--MS. Addit. 29250. A poor MS., but remarkable for containing the scarce
section no. 46; of which there is but one other copy, viz. that in MS. E (§
6); cf. pp. 240, 241.

T.--MS. Phillipps 11955; at Cheltenham. On vellum; 31 leaves; said to be of
the fourteenth century, which is improbable.

U.--MS. Bodley 68. Imperfect; ends at Part ii. § 36.

W.--MS. E Museo 116, in the Bodleian Library. A mere fragment.

X.--A MS. at Brussels, no. 1591. See F. J. Mone, Quellen und Forschungen,
(Aachen, 1830); pp. 549-551.

§ 18. Of the above MSS., Mr. Brae describes H., I., and L. only, and does
not seem to have made use of any others. Mr. Todd, in his Animadversions on
Gower and Chaucer, p. 125, enumerates only four MSS., which are plainly A.,
P., F., and G. The rest seem to have escaped attention.

In addition to the MS. authorities, we have one more source of text, viz.
the Editio Princeps, which may be thus described.

Th.--The edition of Chaucer's Works by Wm. Thynne, printed at London by
Thomas Godfray in 1532. This is the first edition in which the Treatise on
the Astrolabe appeared; it begins at fol. ccxcviii, back. The Conclusions
in Part ii. are in the order following, viz. 1-12, 19-21, 13-18, 22-40;
after which come 41-43, and 41_a_-42_b_. This order does not agree
precisely with that in any MS. now extant, with the exception of I., which
imitates it. It has some corrupt additions and exhibits many grave errors.
All later editions, down to Urry's in 1721, contribute no new information.
The few slight alterations which appear in them are such as could have been
made without reference to MSS. at all.

§ 19. REMARKS ON THE CLASSES OF THE MSS. On comparing the MSS., it at once
appears that they do not agree as to the order of the Conclusions in Part
ii. The MSS. A., B., C. (which are unquestionably the oldest), as well as
E., F., G., and P., adopt the order which appears in this edition, but
which has never appeared in any previous edition. In all other editions we
find the three sections 19-21 made to precede sections 13-18. Now we might
here appeal to authority only, and say that the order in the _oldest_ MSS.
ought to be preferred. But it so happens that we can appeal to internal
evidence as well, and there are two considerations which shew that the
oldest MSS. are certainly correct. These are as follows. In the _first_
place, sect. 18 amounts to finding the degree of the zodiac which _souths_
with any star, and begins with the words 'Set the centre of the sterre upon
the lyne meridional'; whilst sect. 19 amounts to finding the degree of the
zodiac that _rises_ with any star, and begins with the words 'Set the
sentre of the sterre upon the est orisonte.' Clearly, these Conclusions are
closely linked together, and one ought to follow the other. But, in all the
editions, this continuity is broken. In the _second_ place, the rubric of
sect. 21 is--'To knowe for what latitude in any regioun,' &c.; whilst that
of sect. 22 is--'To knowe in special the latitude of oure countray,' &c.
Clearly, these Conclusions are closely linked, and in their right order.
But, in all the editions, this continuity is again broken; and we have this
absurd result, viz. that a proposition headed--'To knowe the degrees of the
longitudes of fixe sterres' is followed by one headed--'To knowe _in
special_ the latitude of oure countray.' Hence we are enabled to draw a
line, and to divide the MSS. into two classes; those in which the order of
sections is correct, and those in which it has suffered misplacement, the
number in each class being much the same. This gives us the following
result.

_First Class._ A., B., C, (probably D.,) E., F., G., P.

_Second Class._ H., I., K., L., M., N., O., R.; to which add Th.

But this division immediately leads to another very curious result, and
that is, a certain lack of authority for sections after the _fortieth_,
which ends on p. 223.

A. ends with an incomplete sentence, in sect. 40, with the words--'howre
after howre.' B., C. end exactly at the same place.

E. ends sect. 40 with the same words; and, after this, has only one
additional section (46), which is, in my opinion, spurious; especially as
it does not appear in Messahala, of which more anon.

D., F., and G. all fail at an earlier point.

In none of the first-class MSS. (excepting P., which terminates with
section 43) is there a word about _umbra recta_ or _umbra versa_.

Even in the second class of MSS., we find H. breaking off at sect. 36, and
K. at sect. 35; so that the sections on the _umbrae_ rest only on MSS. I.
(obviously an edition, not a transcript), L., M., N., O., P., and R.
Putting aside the first of these, as being 'edited,' we have but six left;
and in the first four and the last of these we find that the additional
Conclusions appear in a certain order, viz. they insert 44 and 45 (on the
'mene mote') between three sections 41-43 on the 'umbrae' and five other
sections 41_a_-42_b_ on the same.

§ 20. THE LAST FIVE SECTIONS SPURIOUS. This at once suggests two results.
The _first_ is, that, as this gives two sets of sections on the 'umbrae,'
we can hardly expect both to be genuine; and accordingly, we at once find
that the _last five_ of these are mere clumsy repetitions of the _first
three_; for which reason, I unhesitatingly reject the said _last five_ as
spurious. This view is strikingly confirmed by MS. P.; for this, the only
first-class MS. that is carried on beyond section 40, contains the first
three sections on the 'umbrae' only. The _second_ result is, that if the
first three sections on the 'umbrae' are to be received, there is good
reason why we should consider the possible genuineness of sections 44 and
45 on the 'mene mote,' which rest very nearly on the same authority.

Now the sections on the 'mene mote' have in their favour one strong piece
of internal evidence; for the date 1397 is mentioned in them more than once
as being the 'root' or epoch from which to reckon. In most cases, the
mention of a date 1397 would lead us to attribute the writing in which it
occurs to that year or to a _later_ year, but a date fixed on for a 'root'
may very well be a _prospective_ one, so that these sections may have been
written _before_ 1397; an idea which is supported by the line 'behold
whether thy date be more or _lasse_ than the yere 1397'; sect. 44, l. 5.
But I suspect the date to be an error for 1387, since that [see _Somer_ in
Tyrwhitt's Glossary] was really the 'rote' used by Nicholas Lenne. In
either case, I think we may connect these sections with the previous
sections written in 1391[47]. Besides which, Chaucer so expressly intimates
his acquaintance with the subjects of these sections in the Canterbury
Tales[48], that we may the more readily admit them to be really his. There
is still less difficulty about admitting the first three sections (41-43)
on the 'umbrae,' because we find similar matter in the treatise of
Messahala, from which, as will appear, he derived so much. And hence we may
readily conclude that, in the second part, the first forty sections, found
in the oldest MSS., are certainly genuine, whilst sections 41-43, as well
as 44 and 45, have every claim to be considered genuine also. This need
not, however, force us to accept the remaining sections, since they may
easily have been added by another hand; a circumstance which is rendered
the more probable by the fact that sections 41_a_-42_b_ merely repeat 41-43
in a more clumsy form, and by the consideration that, if genuine, they
should have occupied their proper place immediately after sect. 43, instead
of being separated from the former set. As to sect. 46, I pronounce no
decided opinion; there is but little to be said either for or against it,
and it is of little consequence.

§ 21. GAP BETWEEN §§ 40 AND 41. But admitting the genuineness of sections
40-45, it at once becomes evident that there are two distinct gaps or
breaks in the continuity of the treatise; the first between 40 and 41; and
the second between 43 and 44. A little consideration will account for
these. Looking at the Canterbury Tales, we observe the very same
peculiarity; at certain points there are distinct breaks, and no mending
can link the various groups together in a satisfactory manner. This can be
accounted for in part by our knowledge of the fact that the poet died
before he had completed the proper linking-together of the tales which he
had more or less finished; but I think it also shews him to have been a
fragmentary worker. To suppose that, upon reaching Conclusion 40, he
suddenly turned to the sections upon the 'umbrae,' which are at once more
easy to explain, more suitable for a child, and illustrative of a different
and more practical use of the Astrolabe, seems to me natural enough; and
more probable than to suppose that anything is here lost. For, in fact, it
is to the very MSS. that contain sections 41-43 that we are indebted for
the last five words of sect. 40, so curiously omitted in the oldest and
best MSS.; and this is a direct argument against the supposition of any
matter having been here lost.

§ 22. GAP BETWEEN §§ 43 AND 44. The break between sections 43 and 44 may be
explained in a totally different manner. In this case, the break indicates
a _real_, not an accidental, gap. I suppose section 43 to have been really
the _last_ section of Part ii, and I refer sections 44 and 45 to the
_Fourth_ Part of the Treatise, and not to the _Second_ at all[49]. For if
we run through the contents of Parts Three and Four (p. 177), we observe
that they chiefly involve tables, with reference to one of which we find
the words 'upon which table ther folwith a _canon_,' &c. Now sections 44
and 45 exactly answer the description; they are alternative _canons_,
shewing how certain tables may be used. It happens that Conclusion 40 is
particularly dependent upon tables. To supply these was partly the object
of Part iv--'the whiche ferthe partie in special shal shewen a _table of
the verray moeving of the mone from houre to houre_, every day and in every
signe, after thyn almenak; _upon which table ther folwith a canon_,
suffisant to teche as wel the _maner of the wyrking of that same
conclusioun_, as to knowe in oure orizonte with which degree of the zodiac
that the mone ariseth in any latitude; and the arising of any planete after
his latitude fro the ecliptik lyne.' The opening words of the same
Conclusion are--'Knowe by thyn almenak the degree of the ecliptik of any
signe in which that the planete is rekned for to be:' (p. 221). This is
easily said; but I suppose that it was not so easy in olden times to know
off-hand the exact position of a planet. It must have been shewn by tables,
and these tables chiefly considered the 'mene mote,' or average motion of
the planets, and that only for periods of years. If you wanted the position
of a planet at a given hour on a given day, you had to work it out by
figures; the rule for which working was called a 'canon.' This very 'canon'
is precisely given at length in sect. 44; and sect. 45 is only another way
of doing the same thing, or, in other words, is an alternative canon. When
all this is fairly and sufficiently considered, we shall find good grounds
for supposing that these sections on the 'mene mote' are perfectly genuine,
and that they really belong to Part iv. of the Treatise.

I will only add, that the fact of sections 41_a_-42_b_ being thus placed
after a portion of Part iv. is one more indication that they are spurious.

§ 23. CONCLUSION 40. But it may be objected, as Mr. Brae has fairly
objected, that Conclusion 40 itself ought to belong to Part iv. So it ought
perhaps, if Chaucer had followed out his own plan. But it is clear from its
contents that the Prologue to the 'Astrolabie' was written _before_ the
commencement of the treatise itself, and not, as prefaces generally are,
afterwards. He was pleased with his son's progress. Little Lewis had asked
him if he might learn something about an astrolabe. The father at once sent
him a small astrolabe[50] by way of reward, constructed for the latitude of
Oxford, and having 45 circles of latitude on the flat disc (see Fig. 5)
instead of having 90 such circles, as the best instruments had[51]. This,
however, was a 'sufficient' astrolabe for the purpose. But he believes the
Latin treatises to be too hard for his son's use, and the Conclusions in
them to be too numerous. He therefore proposes to select some of the more
important Conclusions, and to turn them into English with such
modifications as would render them easier for a child to understand, He
then lays down a table of contents of his proposed five parts, throughout
which he employs the future tense, as 'the firste partie _shal_
reherse,'--'the second partie _shal_ teche,' &c. This use of the future
would not alone prove much, but taken in connexion with the context, it
becomes very suggestive. However, the most significant phrase is in the
last line of the Prologue, which speaks of 'other noteful thinges, yif god
wol vouche-sauf & his modur the mayde, mo than I behete,' i.e. other useful
things, _more than I now promise, if God and the Virgin vouchsafe it_. In
accordance with his habits of seldom finishing and of deviating from his
own plans at pleasure, we have but an imperfect result, not altogether
answerable to the table of contents. I therefore agree with Mr. Brae that
the 40th Conclusion would have done better for Part iv., though I do not
agree with him in rejecting it as spurious. This he was led to do by the
badness of the text of the MSS. which he consulted, but we can hardly
reject this Conclusion without rejecting the whole Treatise, as it is found
in all the oldest copies. By way of illustration, I would point out that
this is not the only difficulty, for the Conclusions about astrology ought
certainly to have been reserved for Part v. These are Conclusions 36 and
37, which concern the 'equaciouns of houses'; and this is probably why, in
three of the MSS. (viz. L., N., and R.), these two conclusions are made to
come _at the end of the Treatise_. There is nothing for it but to accept
what we have, and be thankful.

§ 24. EXTANT PORTION OF THE TREATISE. If, then, the questions be asked, how
much of the Treatise has come down to us, and what was to have been the
contents of the missing portion, the account stands thus.

Of Part i. we have the whole.

Of Part ii. we have nearly all, and probably all that ever was written,
including Conclusions 1-40 on astronomical matters, and Conclusions 41-43
on the taking of altitudes of terrestrial objects. Possibly Conclusion 46
is to be added to these; but Conclusions 41_a_-42_b_ are certainly
spurious.

Part iii. probably consisted entirely of tables, and some at least of these
may very well have been transmitted to little Lewis. Indeed, they may have
been prepared by or copied from Nicholas of Lynn and John Somer, before
Chaucer took the rest in hand. The tables were to have been (and perhaps
were) as follows:--

1. Tables of latitude and longitudes of the stars which were represented on
the 'Rete' of the Astrolabe. Specimens of such tables are found in MSS.

2. Tables of declinations of the sun, according to the day of the year.

3. Tables of longitudes of cities and towns.

4. Tables for setting clocks and finding the meridian altitudes (of the
sun, probably).

Such tables as these are by no means lost. There are MSS. which contain
little else, as e.g. MS. Hh. 6. 8 in the Cambridge University Library. The
longitudes of towns are given in MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 3, at fol. 214_b_. Again,
in MS. F. 25, in St. John's College Library, Cambridge, we find tables of
fixed stars, tables of latitudes and longitudes of towns, tables of
altitudes of the sun at different hours, and many others.

Part iv. was to explain the motions of the heavenly bodies, with their
causes. This was probably never written, though there is an allusion to it
in Part ii. § 11, l. 12. It was also to contain a table to shew the
position of the moon, according to an almanac; and such a table is given in
the St. John's MS. above mentioned, and in MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 3, at fol. 143.
This was to have been followed by a canon, and an explanation of the
working of the Conclusion--'to knowe with which degree of the zodiac that
the mone ariseth,' and 'the arising of any planete,' &c. The canon is
partly accounted for, as regards the planets at least, by sections 44 and
45, and the 'Conclusion' by section 40.

Part v. was to contain the general rules of astrology, with tables of
equations of houses, dignities of planets, and other useful things which
God and the Virgin might vouchsafe that the author should accomplish.
Sections 36 and 37 tell us something about the equations of houses; but, in
all probability, none (or, at least, no more) of this fifth Part was ever
written. Tables of equations of houses, for the latitude of Toledo, are
given in MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 3, at fol. 177, and elsewhere. Of the general
rules of astrology we find in old MSS. somewhat too much, but they are
generally in Latin; however, the Trinity MS. R. 15. 18 has some of them in
English.

On the whole, we have quite as much of Chaucer's Treatise as we need care
for; and he may easily have changed his mind about the necessity of writing
Part v; for we actually find him declaring (and it is pleasant to hear him)
that 'natheles, thise ben observauncez of iudicial matiere & _rytes of
payens, in which my spirit ne hath no feith_'; ii. 4. 36; (p. 192).

§ 25. SOURCES OF THE TREATISE. I next have to point out the sources whence
Chaucer's treatise was derived. Mr. Halliwell, in a note at the end of his
edition of Mandeville's Travels, speaks of the original treatise on the
Astrolabe, written in Sanskrit, on which he supposes Chaucer's treatise to
have been founded. Whether the Latin version used by Chaucer was ultimately
derived from a Sanskrit copy or not, need not be considered here. The use
of the Astrolabe was no doubt well known at an early period in India and
among the Persians and Arabs; see the 'Description of a Planispheric
Astrolabe constructed for Sháh Sultán Husain Safawí, King of Persia,' by W.
H. Morley, in which elaborate and beautifully illustrated volume the reader
may find sufficient information. Marco Polo says (bk. ii. c. 33) that there
were 5000 astrologers and soothsayers in the city of Cambaluc,
adding--'they have a kind of _Astrolabe_, on which are inscribed the
planetary signs, the hours, and critical points of the whole year'; Marco
Polo, ed. Yule, i. 399. Compare also the mention of the instrument in the
161st night of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, where a translation
which I have now before me has the words--'instead of putting water into
the basin, he [the barber] took a very handsome astrolabe out of his case,
and went very gravely out of my room to the middle of the yard, to take the
height of the sun'; on which passage Mr. Lane has a note (chap. v. note 57)
which Mr. Brae quotes at length in his edition. There is also at least one
version of a treatise in Greek, entitled [Greek: peri tês tou astrolabou
chrêseôs], by Johannes Philoponus, of which the Cambridge University
Library possesses two copies, viz. MSS. Dd. 15. 27 and Gg. 2. 33. But it is
clear, from his own words, that Chaucer followed the Latin, and I can point
out[52] one of the Latin treatises to which he was very considerably
indebted. This is the 'Compositio et Operatio Astrolabie,' by
Messahala[53], of which copies are, I have no doubt, sufficiently numerous.
The Cambridge Library has four, viz. Hh. 6. 8, Ii. 1. 13, Ii. 3. 3[54], and
Kk. 1. 1, and there is another copy in St. John's College Library,
Cambridge, marked F. 25. The title should be particularly observed; for the
treatise is distinctly divisible into two separate parts, viz. the
'Compositio Astrolabii' and the 'Operatio Astrolabii.' The former begins
with the words--'Scito quod astrolabium sit nomen Graecum,' and explains
how to make an astrolabe, and how to inscribe on it the various necessary
lines and circles with sufficient exactness. It is much the longer portion
of the treatise, and (in MS. Ii. 3. 3) is illustrated by numerous diagrams,
whilst the second part has no such illustrations. But it does not appear
that Chaucer made any use of this former part, as his astrolabe had been
procured ready-made. The second part of the treatise, or 'Operatio
Astrolabii,' begins with the words 'Nomina instrumentorum sunt hec.' This
is evidently one of the sources from which Chaucer drew largely[55].
Chaucer's Part i. is almost wholly taken from this, but he has expanded it
in several places, with the evident intention of making it more easy to
understand. In Part ii. he has taken from it, with more or less exactness,
sections 1-3, 5-8, 10, 11, 13-18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27-31, 33-37, 41 and 42;
whilst sections 4, 9, 12, 19, 22, 23, 26, 32, 38-40 and 43 do not appear in
it. In other words, Messahala's treatise accounts for thirty-one
conclusions out of forty-three, or about _two-thirds_ of the whole. In some
places, Chaucer has translated almost word for word, so as to leave no
doubt as to his authority. Besides which, I have already remarked that
Chaucer's version is _directly_ connected with Messahala by the quotations
from the latter which appear in MS. E.; see description of this MS. at p.
lix. If it be inquired, whence did Chaucer derive the remaining third of
his Second Part, I think it very likely that some of it may be found
amongst the varied and voluminous contents of such a MS. as Ii 3. 3, which
is a sort of general compendium of astronomical and astrological knowledge.
The complete solution of this question I leave to some one with more
leisure than myself, being satisfied that to have found the original of
Part i. and two-thirds of Part ii. is to have made a good start. It must
not be omitted, that the MSS. of Messahala are not all alike; that some
copies have propositions which are not in others; and that the order of the
Conclusions is not invariable. The chief noteworthy difference between
Chaucer's version and the Latin original is in the order of the
Conclusions; it is clear that Chaucer not only took what he liked, but
rearranged his materials after his own fashion.

§ 26. VARIOUS EDITIONS. About the early printed editions of the Astrolabe,
I have not much to say. The Editio Princeps of 1532 was clearly derived
from some MS. of the second class, and, what between the errors of the
scribes and printers, absurdities abound. After a careful examination of
the old editions, I came to the conclusion that the less I consulted them
the better, and have therefore rather avoided them than sought their
assistance. All the editions not only give the conclusions in a wrong
order, but (like the MSS. of the second class) absurdly repeat Conclusion
I. of Part ii., and reckon the repetition of it as Conclusion III. MSS. of
the first class are free from this defect, and may thus be easily known.
The only edition worth consulting is that by Mr. A. E. Brae, published
quite recently, in 1870. Mr. Brae made much use of MS. I., besides which he
consulted the Printed Editions, and MSS. H. and L. See the descriptions of
these MSS. above. From this edition I have taken many hints, and I wish to
express, very thankfully, my obligations to it. Mr. Brae has brought to
bear upon his work much skill and knowledge, and has investigated many
points with much patience, minuteness, and critical ability. But I cannot
but perceive that he has often expended his labour upon very inferior
materials, and has been sometimes misled by the badness of those MSS. to
which alone he had access[56].

Besides his print of Chaucer's Astrolabe, Mr. Brae has reprinted some
curious and interesting critical notes of his own, and has added some
essays on Chaucer's 'prime,' on 'the Carrenare,' and 'shippes opposteres.'
To all that he has done I am much indebted.

§ 27. WORKS ON THE SUBJECT. The works upon, and descriptions of, the
astrolabe, are numerous. I have had neither time nor inclination to make
researches into the subject; for which reason I here note the names of a
few books which may be examined by the curious reader.

In his Universal Lexicon, Zedler explains that astrolabes are of two kinds,
'universal' and 'particular.' He speaks of the astrolabes (1) of Gemma
Frisius; see Petri Apiani Cosmographia, per Gemmam Phrysium restituta; (2)
of Johan de Rojas, a Spaniard, A.D. 1550; (3) of De la Hire the elder,
professor of mathematics at Paris, A.D. 1702; (4) of Johannes Stoflerinus
(or Stöffler), A.D. 1510. The last of these varied from the others in
adopting a different and more convenient system of projection, viz. that
upon the plane of the equator, or one parallel to it, the eye being in the
antarctic pole, and the arctic pole being made the centre of the
instrument. This projection is the same as that which was used by Ptolemy,
and it is adopted in the diagrams which accompany Chaucer's treatise in
some of the MSS. It should be observed here that the term 'astrolabe' alone
is vague; it was originally a general name for any circular instrument used
for observation of the stars; but in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries it was restricted to the particular kind called the 'Astrolabe
Planisphere,' or astrolabe _on a flat surface_, in which sense alone the
word is used throughout this volume. See the English Cyclopaedia, Arts and
Sciences, s.v. _Astrolabe_.

The simplest work is that by Stöffler or Stoflerinus, as he calls himself;
see also Gemma Frisius, Metius, Clavius Bambergensis, the Cursus
Mathematicus of Dechales, vol. iv. p. 161, Delambre's History of Astronomy,
and other works. The plates in Metius are most exquisitely engraved, and on
a large scale, and give a better representation of the instrument than any
others that I have seen.

One of the MSS., viz. MS. E., refers to an astrolabe belonging to Merton
College, Oxford[57]. There is a very nice one, made of brass, and by a
Dutch engraver, in the library of King's College, Cambridge. It has several
discs or plates, or, as Chaucer calls them, 'tables[58].' Of this
instrument the same library contains a written description, with some
account of the problems it will solve, and an investigation of its probable
date, by H. Godfray, Esq., of St. John's College.

There is a book entitled 'A verie briefe and most plaine description of Mr.
Blagrave his Astrolabe,' &c., by Mr. Blundevill; London, printed by William
Stansby. But it turns out to be of little practical assistance, because
Blagrave's astrolabe was on a different principle.

§ 28. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASTROLABE PLANISPHERE. There is not, however, much
need of reference to books to understand what the astrolabe used by Chaucer
was like. The instrument may be readily understood from a brief
description, and from the Plates in this volume.

The most important part of the 'astrolabe planisphere' consisted of a
somewhat heavy circular plate of metal from four to seven inches in
diameter, which could be suspended from the thumb by a ring (i. 1), working
with such freedom as would allow the instrument to assume a perfectly
perpendicular position (i. 2). One side of the plate was perfectly flat,
and was called the _back_. This is represented in Fig. 1. On it was
described a number of concentric rings, marked with various divisions,
which may be readily understood from the figure. Beginning at the outermost
ring, the first two represent the ninety degrees into which each quadrant
of a circle can be divided (i. 7). The next two represent the signs of the
zodiac, each subdivided into thirty degrees (i. 8). The next two represent
the days of the year, and are rather difficult to mark, as the circle has,
for this purpose, to be divided into 365¼ equal parts (i. 9). The next
three circles shew the names of the months, the number of days in each, and
the small divisions which represent each day, which coincide exactly with
those representing the days of the year (i. 10). The two innermost rings
shew the saints' days, with their Sunday-letters. Thus, above the 21st of
December is written 'Thome,' i.e. St. Thomas's day, its Sunday-letter being
E; the rest can easily be traced by the tables in a Prayer-book (i. 11).
These may be thus briefly recapitulated:--

  1 and 2. Circles of degrees of the quadrant and circle.

  3 and 4. Circles of the zodiacal signs, with their degrees.

  5 and 6. Circles of the days of the year, with their numbers.

  7, 8 and 9. Circles of the months, with their days and numbers of the
  days.

  10 and 11. Circles of saints' days, with their Sunday-letters.

Within all these, are the Scales of Umbra Recta and Umbra Versa, in each of
which the scale is divided into twelve equal parts, for the convenience of
taking and computing altitudes (i. 12). This primitive and loose method of
computation has long been superseded by the methods of trigonometry.
Besides these circles, there is a perpendicular line, marking the South and
North points, and a horizontal line from East to West.

The other side of the plate, called the _front_, and shewn in Fig. 2, had a
thick rim with a wide depression in the middle (i. 3). The rim was marked
with three rings or circles, of which the outermost was the Circle of
Letters (A to Z) representing the twenty-four hours of the day, and the two
innermost the degrees of the quadrants (i. 16). The depressed central
portion of the plate was marked only with three circles, the 'Tropicus
Cancri,' the 'Æquinoctialis,' and the 'Tropicus Capricorni' (i. 17); and
with the cross-lines from North to South, and from East to West (i. 15).
But several thin plates or discs of metal were provided, which were of such
a size as exactly to drop into the depression spoken of. The principal one
of these, called the 'Rete,' is shewn in Fig. 2. It consisted of a circular
ring marked with the zodiacal signs, subdivided into degrees, with narrow
branching limbs both within and without this ring, having smaller branches
or tongues terminating in points, each of which denoted the exact position
of some well-known star. The names of these stars, as 'Alhabor,' 'Rigel,'
&c., are (some of them) written on the branches (i. 21). The 'Rete' being
thus, as it were, a skeleton plate, allows the 'Tropicus Cancri,' &c.,
marked upon the body of the instrument, to be partially seen below it.
Another form of the 'Rete' is shewn in Fig. 9, and other _positions_ of the
Rete in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. But it was more usual to interpose between the
'Rete' and the body of the instrument (called the 'Mother') another thin
plate or disc, such as that in Fig. 5, so that portions of this latter
plate could be seen beneath the skeleton-form of the 'Rete' (i. 17). These
plates are called by Chaucer 'tables,' and sometimes an instrument was
provided with several of them, differently marked, for use in places having
different latitudes. The one in Fig. 5 is suitable for the latitude of
Oxford (nearly). The upper part, above the Horizon Obliquus, is marked with
circles of altitude (i. 18), crossed by incomplete arcs of azimuth tending
to a common centre, the zenith (i. 19). The lower part of the same plate is
marked with arcs denoting the twelve planetary hours (i. 20).

At the _back_ of the astrolabe revolved the 'rule,' made of metal, and
fitted with sights, represented in Fig. 3 (i. 13). At the _front_ of it
revolved the 'label,' represented in Fig. 6 (i. 22).

All the parts were held together by the central pin (Fig. 4) which passed
through the holes in the 'moder,' plates, 'Rete,' rule, and label[59], and
was secured by a little wedge (i. 14), which was sometimes fancifully
carved to resemble a horse (Fig. 7).

Another 'table' or disc is shewn in Fig. 14, and was used for ascertaining
the twelve astrological houses.

§ 29. USES OF THE ASTROLABE PLANISPHERE. I here briefly enumerate such
principal uses of the instrument as are mentioned by Chaucer.

The _back_ (Fig. 1) shews at once the degree of the zodiac answering to
every day in the year (ii. 1). The altitude of the sun can be taken by the
'Rule,' elevated at the proper angle (ii. 2). If the Rete be properly
adjusted to this altitude, we can thus tell the hour of the day (ii. 3).
The duration of twilight can be calculated by observing when the sun is 18°
below the horizon (ii. 6). Observe the times of sunrise and sundown, and
the interval is the 'artificial day' (ii. 7). This day, with the duration
of morning and evening twilights added to it, is called the 'vulgar day'
(ii. 9). The plate in Fig. 5 shews the planetary hours (ii. 12). The
placing of the sun's degree on the South-line gives the sun's meridian
altitude (ii. 13), and conversely (ii. 14). The back of the instrument can
shew what days in the year are of equal length (ii. 15). The degree of the
zodiac which souths with _any_ star can be ascertained by observing two
altitudes of the star; but the observations must be made when the star is
_very near_ the meridian (ii. 17). If the star be marked on the Rete, the
said degree is easily found by use of the Rete (ii. 18). We can also find
with what degree of the zodiac the same star rises (ii. 19). The use of the
Rete also shews the declination of every degree in the zodiac (ii. 20). We
can always tell for what latitude a disc such as that in Fig. 5 is
constructed, by properly examining it (ii. 21). The latitude of any place
can be found by two observations of the altitude of the Pole-star (ii. 23);
or of any circumpolar star (ii. 24); or by observing the sun's meridional
altitude (ii. 25). The Rete also tells us the 'ascensions of signs,' or how
many degrees of the equinoctial circle pass the meridian with a given sign
(ii. 27); as also the 'oblique ascensions' of the same (ii. 28). The
astrolabe can also be used to discover (but only in an imperfect and
approximate manner) the four cardinal points of the compass (ii. 29). We
can also compare the altitude of a planet with that of the sun (ii. 30). We
can find in what part of the horizon the sun rises (ii. 31); and in what
direction to look for a conjunction of the sun and moon (ii. 32); also near
what point of the compass the sun is at any given hour (ii. 33). The moon's
observed altitude will shew her longitude (ii. 34). We can tell, from two
observations of a planet properly made, whether the planet's movement is
direct or retrograde (ii. 35). The disc shewn in Fig. 14 helps to shew the
'equations of houses' (ii. 36). The four cardinal points can be found
_without_ an astrolabe, by an experiment properly conducted (ii. 38). The
astrolabe can be used to find the degree of the zodiac with which any
planet ascends, even when the planet is not situated in the ecliptic (ii.
40).

By the use of the _Umbra Recta_ on the back of the instrument, we can take
the altitude of an accessible object by a single observation (ii. 41); or
of an inaccessible object by two observations (ii. 43). Or, the height of
an inaccessible object may likewise be taken by two observations, by the
scale marked _Umbra Versa_ (ii. 42).

The few Conclusions not here referred to are chiefly explanatory, or of
minor interest.

§ 30. STARS MARKED ON THE RETE. Several of the Latin MSS. upon the
Astrolabe give a list of the stars marked upon the Rete. There is a double
list, for example, in MS. Ii. 3. 3, in the Cambridge University Library,
fol. 70, back. It is given in the form of two tables; the first mentions
forty-nine stars, with the degrees of the zodiac which south along with
them, and their declinations from the equinoctial line. The second table
mentions some only of _the same_ stars, with their longitudes and
latitudes, as referred to the ecliptic.

A list of the principal stars usually marked upon the Rete, as shewn in
Fig. 2, is given in the Note to Part i. § 21. 4 (p. 357). Fig. 9 shews
another Rete, with many of the same stars, with the addition of Markep
([iota] Argous). Alchimech is the same as Azimech, i.e. [alpha] Virginis;
Cor Leonis is [alpha] Leonis; and Alfart is [alpha] Hydræ.

§ 31. ASTROLOGICAL NOTES. For a general sketch of Astrology, see the
English Cyclopaedia, s.v. Worthless as the science is, it is useful to have
a few 'facts' for handy reference. I therefore attempt a synopsis of the
chief points of it, drawn from Johannis Hispalensis Isagoge in Astrologiam.

To save space, I give the information in a tabular form, wherein I denote
the twelve Signs by A., T., G., C., L., V., Li., S., Sa., Cp., Aq., P.; and
the seven Planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, by
St., J., Ms., Sn., V., My., Mo. What the table exactly means shall be
explained presently.

The first line is to be read thus.

Aries is the mansion (or house) of Mars; the exaltation (or honour) of the
Sun, in the 19th degree of the sign; the lord of the Triplicity of Aries
with its attendant signs is the Sun by day, Jupiter by night, and Saturn in
Common, both by day and night; the first Face of Aries (degrees 1 to 10) is
that of Mars; the second Face (degrees 11 to 20) is that of the Sun; the
third Face (degrees 21 to 30) is that of Venus. And so on for the rest;
noting that Gemini is the Exaltation of the Dragon's Head (D. H.), and
Sagittarius that of the Dragon's Tail (D. T.).

The meanings of the words are as follows:--

A _Mansion_ or _House_ appears to be that sign in which the planet is
peculiarly at home for some reason or other.

The _Exaltation_ or _Honour_ is that degree of a sign in which the planet
named has its greatest power; but the degree was often neglected, and Aries
was called the Exaltation of the Sun, simply.

The _Fall_ (Lat. _occasus vel detrimentum_) of a planet is the sign
opposite its mansion. Libra is opposite Aries; therefore Libra is the Fall
of Mars.

The _Dejection_ or _Depression_ (Lat. _dedecus_) of a planet is the sign
opposite to that of its exaltation. Libra is opposite Aries; therefore
Libra is the Dejection of the Sun. And so on.

A _Triplicity_ is a combination of three signs in the form of a triangle,
each 120° apart. Thus Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius form the first
triplicity; Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, the second; Gemini, Libra, Aquarius,
the third; Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, the fourth. Equal divisions of a sign
(third-parts, namely) are called _Faces_. There were also unequal divisions
called _Terms_.

The 'mobill' or movable signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn. The
'fixe' or fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius. The 'common'
signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces.

The signs Aries, Gemini, Leo, &c. (taking _every other_ sign) are _diurnal_
or _masculine_. The rest, Taurus, Cancer, &c., are _nocturnal_ or
_feminine_.

The first six signs, Aries to Virgo, are _northern_ or _sinister_ signs. So
called because astrologers looked towards the east or ascendent.

The last six, Libra to Pisces, are _southern_ or _dexter_ signs.

The signs Cancer to Sagittarius are _western_, _sovereign_, _right_, or
_direct_ signs. Cf. Astrol. ii. 28, and see Fig. 2.

The rest, Capricorn to Gemini, are _eastern_, _obedient_, _tortuous_, or
_oblique_ signs.

This is all that a reader is likely to want. For other points, see the
authorities.

THE HOUS OF FAME.




BOOK I.


  God turne us every dreem to gode!
  For hit is wonder, by the rode,
  To my wit, what causeth swevenes
  Either on morwes, or on evenes;
  And why the effect folweth of somme,                                    5
  And of somme hit shal never come;
  Why that is an avisioun,
  And this a revelacioun;
  Why this a dreem, why that a sweven, And nat to every man liche even;  10
  Why this a fantom, these oracles,
  I noot; but who-so of these miracles
  The causes knoweth bet than I,
  Devyne he; for I certeinly
  Ne can hem noght, ne never thinke                                      15
  To besily my wit to swinke,
  To knowe of hir signifiaunce
  The gendres, neither the distaunce
  Of tymes of hem, ne the causes
  For-why this more than that cause is;                                  20
  As if folkes complexiouns
  Make hem dreme of reflexiouns;
  Or elles thus, as other sayn,
  For to greet feblenesse of brayn,
  By abstinence, or by seeknesse,                                        25
  Prison, stewe, or greet distresse;
  Or elles by disordinaunce
  Of naturel acustomaunce,
  That som man is to curious
  In studie, or melancolious,                                            30
  Or thus, so inly ful of drede,
  That no man may him bote bede;
  Or elles, that devocioun
  Of somme, and contemplacioun
  Causeth swiche dremes ofte;                                            35
  Or that the cruel lyf unsofte
  Which these ilke lovers leden
  That hopen over muche or dreden,
  That purely hir impressiouns
  Causeth hem avisiouns;                                                 40
  Or if that spirits have the might
  To make folk to dreme a-night
  Or if the soule, of propre kinde,
  Be so parfit, as men finde,
  That hit forwot that is to come,                                       45
  And that hit warneth alle and somme
  Of everiche of hir aventures
  By avisiouns, or by figures,
  But that our flesh ne hath no might
  To understonden hit aright,                                            50
  For hit is warned to derkly;--
  But why the cause is, noght wot I.
  Wel worthe, of this thing, grete clerkes,
  That trete of this and other werkes;
  For I of noon opinioun                                                 55
  Nil as now make mencioun,
  But only that the holy rode
  Turne us every dreem to gode!
  For never, sith that I was born,
  Ne no man elles, me biforn,                                            60
  Mette, I trowe stedfastly,
  So wonderful a dreem as I
  The tenthe day [dide] of Decembre,
  The which, as I can now remembre,
  I wol yow tellen every del.                                            65

          _The Invocation._

  But at my ginning, trusteth wel,
  I wol make invocacioun,
  With special devocioun,
  Unto the god of slepe anoon,
  That dwelleth in a cave of stoon                                       70
  Upon a streem that comth fro Lete,
  That is a flood of helle unswete;
  Besyde a folk men clepe Cimerie,
  Ther slepeth ay this god unmerie
  With his slepy thousand sones                                          75
  That alway for to slepe hir wone is--
  And to this god, that I of rede,
  Preye I, that he wol me spede
  My sweven for to telle aright,
  If every dreem stonde in his might.                                    80
  And he, that mover is of al
  That is and was, and ever shal,
  So yive hem Ioye that hit here
  Of alle that they dreme to-yere,
  And for to stonden alle in grace                                       85
  Of hir loves, or in what place
  That hem wer levest for to stonde,
  And shelde hem fro povert and shonde,
  And fro unhappe and ech disese,
  And sende hem al that may hem plese,                                   90
  That take hit wel, and scorne hit noght,
  Ne hit misdemen in her thoght
  Through malicious entencioun.
  And who-so, through presumpcioun,
  Or hate or scorne, or through envye,                                   95
  Dispyt, or Iape, or vilanye,
  Misdeme hit, preye I Iesus god
  That (dreme he barfoot, dreme he shod),
  That every harm that any man
  Hath had, sith [that] the world began,                                100
  Befalle him therof, or he sterve,
  And graunte he mote hit ful deserve,
  Lo! with swich a conclusioun
  As had of his avisioun
  Cresus, that was king of Lyde,                                        105
  That high upon a gebet dyde!
  This prayer shal he have of me;
  I am no bet in charite!
    Now herkneth, as I have you seyd,
  What that I mette, or I abreyd.                                       110

          _The Dream._

  Of Decembre the tenthe day,
  Whan hit was night, to slepe I lay
  Right ther as I was wont to done,
  And fil on slepe wonder sone,
  As he that wery was for-go                                            115
  On pilgrimage myles two
  To the corseynt Leonard,
  To make lythe of that was hard.
    But as I sleep, me mette I was
  Within a temple y-mad of glas;                                        120
  In whiche ther were mo images
  Of gold, stondinge in sondry stages,
  And mo riche tabernacles,
  And with perre mo pinacles,
  And mo curious portreytures,                                          125
  And queynte maner of figures
  Of olde werke, then I saw ever.
  For certeynly, I niste never
  Wher that I was, but wel wiste I,
  Hit was of Venus redely,                                              130
  The temple; for, in portreyture,
  I saw anoon-right hir figure
  Naked fletinge in a see.
  And also on hir heed, parde,
  Hir rose-garlond whyt and reed,                                       135
  And hir comb to kembe hir heed,
  Hir dowves, and daun Cupido,
  Hir blinde sone, and Vulcano,
  That in his face was ful broun.
    But as I romed up and doun,                                         140
  I fond that on a wal ther was
  Thus writen, on a table of bras:
  'I wol now singe, if that I can,
  The armes, and al-so the man,
  That first cam, through his destinee,                                 145
  Fugitif of Troye contree,
  In Itaile, with ful moche pyne,
  Unto the strondes of Lavyne.'
  And tho began the story anoon,
  As I shal telle yow echoon.                                           150
    First saw I the destruccioun
  Of Troye, through the Greek Sinoun,
  [That] with his false forsweringe,
  And his chere and his lesinge
  Made the hors broght into Troye,                                      155
  Thorgh which Troyens loste al hir Ioye.
  And after this was grave, allas!
  How Ilioun assailed was
  And wonne, and king Priam y-slayn,
  And Polites his sone, certayn,                                        160
  Dispitously, of dan Pirrus.
    And next that saw I how Venus,
  Whan that she saw the castel brende,
  Doun fro the hevene gan descende,
  And bad hir sone Eneas flee;                                          165
  And how he fledde, and how that he
  Escaped was from al the pres,
  And took his fader, Anchises,
  And bar him on his bakke away,
  Cryinge, 'Allas, and welaway!'                                        170
  The whiche Anchises in his honde
  Bar the goddes of the londe,
  Thilke that unbrende were.
    And I saw next, in alle this fere,
  How Creusa, daun Eneas wyf,                                           175
  Which that he lovede as his lyf,
  And hir yonge sone Iulo,
  And eek Ascanius also,
  Fledden eek with drery chere,
  That hit was pitee for to here;                                       180
  And in a forest, as they wente,
  At a turninge of a wente,
  How Creusa was y-lost, allas!
  That deed, [but] noot I how, she was;
  How he hir soughte, and how hir gost                                  185
  Bad him to flee the Grekes ost,
  And seyde, he moste unto Itaile,
  As was his destinee, sauns faille;
  That hit was pitee for to here,
  Whan hir spirit gan appere,                                           190
  The wordes that she to him seyde,
  And for to kepe hir sone him preyde.
  Ther saw I graven eek how he,
  His fader eek, and his meynee,
  With his shippes gan to sayle                                         195
  Toward the contree of Itaile,
  As streight as that they mighte go.
    Ther saw I thee, cruel Iuno,
  That art daun Iupiteres wyf,
  That hast y-hated, al thy lyf,                                        200
  Al the Troyanisshe blood,
  Renne and crye, as thou were wood,
  On Eolus, the god of windes,
  To blowen out, of alle kindes,
  So loude, that he shulde drenche                                      205
  Lord and lady, grome and wenche
  Of al the Troyan nacioun,
  Withoute any savacioun.
    Ther saw I swich tempeste aryse,
  That every herte mighte agryse,                                       210
  To see hit peynted on the walle.
    Ther saw I graven eek withalle,
  Venus, how ye, my lady dere,
  Wepinge with ful woful chere,
  Prayen Iupiter an hye                                                 215
  To save and kepe that navye
  Of the Troyan Eneas,
  Sith that he hir sone was.
    Ther saw I Ioves Venus kisse,
  And graunted of the tempest lisse.                                    220
  Ther saw I how the tempest stente,
  And how with alle pyne he wente,
  And prevely took arrivage
  In the contree of Cartage;
  And on the morwe, how that he                                         225
  And a knight, hight Achatee,
  Metten with Venus that day,
  Goinge in a queynt array,
  As she had ben an hunteresse,
  With wind blowinge upon hir tresse;                                   230
  How Eneas gan him to pleyne,
  Whan that he knew hir, of his peyne;
  And how his shippes dreynte were,
  Or elles lost, he niste where;
  How she gan him comforte tho,                                         235
  And bad him to Cartage go,
  And ther he shuldë his folk finde,
  That in the see were left behinde.
    And, shortly of this thing to pace,
  She made Eneas so in grace                                            240
  Of Dido, quene of that contree,
  That, shortly for to tellen, she
  Becam his love, and leet him do
  That that wedding longeth to.
  What shulde I speke more queynte,                                     245
  Or peyne me my wordes peynte,
  To speke of love? hit wol not be;
  I can not of that facultee.
  And eek to telle the manere
  How they aqueynteden in-fere,                                         250
  Hit were a long proces to telle,
  And over long for yow to dwelle.
    Ther saw I grave, how Eneas
  Tolde Dido every cas,
  That him was tid upon the see.                                        255
    And after grave was, how she
  Made of him, shortly, at oo word,
  Hir lyf, hir love, hir lust, hir lord;
  And dide him al the reverence,
  And leyde on him al the dispence,                                     260
  That any woman mighte do,
  Weninge hit had al be so,
  As he hir swoor; and her-by demed
  That he was good, for he swich semed.
  Allas! what harm doth apparence,                                      265
  Whan hit is fals in existence!
  For he to hir a traitour was;
  Wherfor she slow hir-self, allas!
    Lo, how a woman doth amis,
  To love him that unknowen is!                                         270
  For, by Crist, lo! thus hit fareth;
  'Hit is not al gold, that glareth.'
  For, al-so brouke I wel myn heed,
  Ther may be under goodliheed
  Kevered many a shrewed vyce;                                          275
  Therfor be no wight so nyce,
  To take a love only for chere,
  For speche, or for frendly manere;
  For this shal every woman finde
  That som man, of his pure kinde,                                      280
  Wol shewen outward the faireste,
  Til he have caught that what him leste;
  And thanne wol he causes finde,
  And swere how that she is unkinde,
  Or fals, or prevy, or double was.                                     285
  Al this seye I by Eneas
  And Dido, and hir nyce lest,
  That lovede al to sone a gest;
  Therfor I wol seye a proverbe,
  That 'he that fully knoweth therbe                                    290
  May saufly leye hit to his yë';
  Withoute dreed, this is no lye.
    But let us speke of Eneas,
  How he betrayed hir, allas!
  And lefte hir ful unkindely.                                          295
  So whan she saw al-utterly,
  That he wolde hir of trouthe faile,
  And wende fro hir to Itaile,
  She gan to wringe hir hondes two.
    'Allas!' quod she, 'what me is wo!                                  300
  Allas! is every man thus trewe,
  That every yere wolde have a newe,
  If hit so longe tyme dure,
  Or elles three, peraventure?
  As thus: of oon he wolde have fame                                    305
  In magnifying of his name;
  Another for frendship, seith he;
  And yet ther shal the thridde be,
  That shal be taken for delyt,
  Lo, or for singular profyt.'                                          310
    In swiche wordes gan to pleyne
  Dido of hir grete peyne,
  As me mette redely;
  Non other auctour alegge I.
  'Allas!' quod she, 'my swete herte,                                   315
  Have pitee on my sorwes smerte,
  And slee me not! go noght away!
  O woful Dido, wel away!'
  Quod she to hir-selve tho.
  'O Eneas! what wil ye do?                                             320
  O, that your love, ne your bonde,
  That ye han sworn with your right honde,
  Ne my cruel deeth,' quod she,
  'May holde yow still heer with me!
  O, haveth of my deeth pitee!                                          325
  Y-wis, my dere herte, ye
  Knowen ful wel that never yit,
  As fer-forth as I hadde wit,
  Agilte [I] yow in thoght ne deed.
  O, have ye men swich goodliheed                                       330
  In speche, and never a deel of trouthe?
  Allas, that ever hadde routhe
  Any woman on any man!
  Now see I wel, and telle can,
  We wrecched wimmen conne non art;                                     335
  For certeyn, for the more part,
  Thus we be served everichone.
  How sore that ye men conne grone,
  Anoon as we have yow receyved!
  Certeinly we ben deceyved;                                            340
  For, though your love laste a sesoun,
  Wayte upon the conclusioun,
  And eek how that ye determynen,
  And for the more part diffynen.
    'O, welawey that I was born!                                        345
  For through yow is my name lorn,
  And alle myn actes red and songe
  Over al this lond, on every tonge.
  O wikke Fame! for ther nis
  Nothing so swift, lo, as she is!                                      350
  O, sooth is, every thing is wist,
  Though hit be kevered with the mist.
  Eek, thogh I mighte duren ever,
  That I have doon, rekever I never,
  That I ne shal be seyd, allas,                                        355
  Y-shamed be through Eneas,
  And that I shal thus Iuged be--
  "Lo, right as she hath doon, now she
  Wol do eftsones, hardily;"
  Thus seyth the peple prevely.'--                                      360
  But that is doon, nis not to done;
  Al hir compleynt ne al hir mone,
  Certeyn, availeth hir not a stre.
    And whan she wiste sothly he
  Was forth unto his shippes goon,                                      365
  She in hir chambre wente anoon,
  And called on hir suster Anne,
  And gan hir to compleyne thanne;
  And seyde, that she cause was
  That she first lovede [Eneas],                                        370
  And thus counseilled hir therto.
  But what! when this was seyd and do,
  She roof hir-selve to the herte,
  And deyde through the wounde smerte.
  But al the maner how she deyde,                                       375
  And al the wordes that she seyde,
  Who-so to knowe hit hath purpos,
  Reed Virgile in Eneidos
  Or the Epistle of Ovyde,
  What that she wroot or that she dyde;                                 380
  And nere hit to long to endyte,
  By god, I woldë hit here wryte.
    But, welaway! the harm, the routhe,
  That hath betid for swich untrouthe,
  As men may ofte in bokes rede,                                        385
  And al day seen hit yet in dede,
  That for to thenken hit, a tene is.
    Lo, Demophon, duk of Athenis,
  How he forswor him ful falsly,
  And trayed Phillis wikkedly,                                          390
  That kinges doghter was of Trace,
  And falsly gan his terme pace;
  And when she wiste that he was fals,
  She heng hir-self right by the hals,
  For he had do hir swich untrouthe;                                    395
  Lo! was not this a wo and routhe?
    Eek lo! how fals and reccheles
  Was to Briseida Achilles,
  And Paris to Enone;
  And Iason to Isiphile;                                                400
  And eft Iason to Medea;
  And Ercules to Dyanira;
  For he lefte hir for Iöle,
  That made him cacche his deeth, parde.
    How fals eek was he, Theseus;                                       405
  That, as the story telleth us,
  How he betrayed Adriane;
  The devel be his soules bane!
  For had he laughed, had he loured,
  He mostë have be al devoured,                                         410
  If Adriane ne had y-be!
  And, for she had of him pitee,
  She made him fro the dethe escape,
  And he made hir a ful fals Iape;
  For after this, within a whyle                                        415
  He lefte hir slepinge in an yle,
  Deserte alone, right in the see,
  And stal away, and leet hir be;
  And took hir suster Phedra tho
  With him, and gan to shippe go.                                       420
  And yet he had y-sworn to here,
  On al that ever he mighte swere,
  That, so she saved him his lyf,
  He wolde have take hir to his wyf;
  For she desired nothing elles,                                        425
  In certein, as the book us telles.
    But to excusen Eneas
  Fulliche of al his greet trespas,
  The book seyth, Mercurie, sauns faile,
  Bad him go into Itaile,                                               430
  And leve Auffrykes regioun,
  And Dido and hir faire toun.
    Tho saw I grave, how to Itaile
  Daun Eneas is go to saile;
  And how the tempest al began,                                         435
  And how he loste his steresman,
  Which that the stere, or he took keep,
  Smot over-bord, lo! as he sleep.
    And also saw I how Sibyle
  And Eneas, besyde an yle,                                             440
  To helle wente, for to see
  His fader, Anchises the free.
  How he ther fond Palinurus,
  And Dido, and eek Deiphebus;
  And every tourment eek in helle                                       445
  Saw he, which is long to telle.
  Which who-so willeth for to knowe,
  He moste rede many a rowe
  On Virgile or on Claudian,
  Or Daunte, that hit telle can.                                        450
    Tho saw I grave al tharivaile
  That Eneas had in Itaile;
  And with king Latine his tretee,
  And alle the batailles that he
  Was at him-self, and eek his knightes,                                455
  Or he had al y-wonne his rightes;
  And how he Turnus refte his lyf,
  And wan Lavyna to his wyf;
  And al the mervelous signals
  Of the goddes celestials;                                             460
  How, maugre Iuno, Eneas,
  For al hir sleighte and hir compas,
  Acheved al his aventure;
  For Iupiter took of him cure
  At the prayere of Venus;                                              465
  The whiche I preye alway save us,
  And us ay of our sorwes lighte!
    Whan I had seyen al this sighte
  In this noble temple thus,
  'A, Lord!' thoughte I, 'that madest us,                               470
  Yet saw I never swich noblesse
  Of images, ne swich richesse,
  As I saw graven in this chirche;
  But not woot I who dide hem wirche,
  Ne wher I am, ne in what contree.                                     475
  But now wol I go out and see,
  Right at the wiket, if I can
  See o-wher stering any man,
  That may me telle wher I am.'
    When I out at the dores cam,                                        480
  I faste aboute me beheld.
  Then saw I but a large feld,
  As fer as that I mighte see,
  Withouten toun, or hous, or tree,
  Or bush, or gras, or ered lond;                                       485
  For al the feld nas but of sond
  As smal as man may see yet lye
  In the desert of Libye;
  Ne I no maner creature,
  That is y-formed by nature,                                           490
  Ne saw, me [for] to rede or wisse.
  'O Crist,' thoughte I, 'that art in blisse,
  Fro fantom and illusioun
  Me save!' and with devocioun
  Myn yën to the heven I caste.                                         495
    Tho was I war, lo! at the laste,
  That faste by the sonne, as hyë
  As kenne mighte I with myn yë,
  Me thoughte I saw an egle sore,
  But that hit semed moche more                                         500
  Then I had any egle seyn.
  But this as sooth as deeth, certeyn,
  Hit was of golde, and shoon so bright,
  That never saw men such a sighte,
  But-if the heven hadde y-wonne                                        505
  Al newe of golde another sonne;
  So shoon the egles fethres brighte,
  And somwhat dounward gan hit lighte.

          _Proem._

    Now herkneth, every maner man
  That English understonde can,                                         510
  And listeth of my dreem to lere;
  For now at erste shul ye here
  So selly an avisioun,
  That Isaye, ne Scipioun,
  Ne king Nabugodonosor,                                                515
  Pharo, Turnus, ne Elcanor,
  Ne mette swich a dreem as this!
  Now faire blisful, O Cipris,                                         (10)
  So be my favour at this tyme!
  And ye, me to endyte and ryme                                         520
  Helpeth, that on Parnaso dwelle
  By Elicon the clere welle.
    O Thought, that wroot al that I mette,
  And in the tresorie hit shette
  Of my brayn! now shal men see                                         525
  If any vertu in thee be,
  To tellen al my dreem aright;
  Now kythe thyn engyn and might!                                      (20)

          _The Dream._

    This egle, of which I have yow told,
  That shoon with fethres as of gold,                                   530
  Which that so hyë gan to sore,
  I gan beholde more and more,
  To see hir beautee and the wonder;
  But never was ther dint of thonder,
  Ne that thing that men calle foudre,                                  535
  That smoot somtyme a tour to poudre,
  And in his swifte coming brende,
  That so swythe gan descende,                                         (30)
  As this foul, whan hit behelde
  That I a-roume was in the felde;                                      540
  And with his grimme pawes stronge,
  Within his sharpe nayles longe,
  Me, fleinge, at a swappe he hente,
  And with his sours agayn up wente,
  Me caryinge in his clawes starke                                      545
  As lightly as I were a larke,
  How high, I can not telle yow,
  For I cam up, I niste how.                                           (40)
  For so, astonied and a-sweved
  Was every vertu in my heved,                                          550
  What with his sours and with my drede,
  That al my feling gan to dede;
  For-why hit was to greet affray.
    Thus I longe in his clawes lay,
  Til at the laste he to me spak                                        555
  In mannes vois, and seyde, 'Awak!
  And be not so a-gast, for shame!'
  And called me tho by my name.                                        (50)
  And, for I sholde the bet abreyde--
  Me mette--'Awak,' to me he seyde,                                     560
  Right in the same vois and stevene
  That useth oon I coude nevene;
  And with that vois, soth for to sayn,
  My minde cam to me agayn;
  For hit was goodly seyd to me,                                        565
  So nas hit never wont to be.
    And herwithal I gan to stere,
  And he me in his feet to bere,                                       (60)
  Til that he felte that I had hete,
  And felte eek tho myn herte bete.                                     570
  And tho gan he me to disporte,
  And with wordes to comforte,
  And sayde twyës, 'Seynte Marie!
  Thou art noyous for to carie,
  And nothing nedeth hit, parde!                                        575
  For al-so wis god helpe me
  As thou non harm shalt have of this;
  And this cas, that betid thee is,                                    (70)
  Is for thy lore and for thy prow;--
  Let see! darst thou yet loke now?                                     580
  Be ful assured, boldely,
  I am thy frend.' And therwith I
  Gan for to wondren in my minde.
  'O god,' thoughte I, 'that madest kinde,
  Shal I non other weyes dye?                                           585
  Wher Ioves wol me stellifye,
  Or what thing may this signifye?
  I neither am Enok, ne Elye,                                          (80)
  Ne Romulus, ne Ganymede
  That was y-bore up, as men rede,                                      590
  To hevene with dan Iupiter,
  And maad the goddes boteler.'
    Lo! this was tho my fantasye!
  But he that bar me gan espye
  That I so thoghte, and seyde this:--                                  595

  And livest thus as an hermyte,
  Although thyn abstinence is lyte.                                     660

  As Aristotle and dan Platon,
  And other clerkes many oon;                                           760
  And to confirme my resoun,
  Thou wost wel this, that speche is soun,
  Or elles no man mighte hit here;
  Now herkne what I wol thee lere.
    'Soun is noght but air y-broken,                                    765
  And every speche that is spoken,

  In his substaunce is but air;                                       (260)
  For as flaumbe is but lighted smoke,
  Right so soun is air y-broke.                                         770
  But this may be in many wyse,
  Of which I wil thee two devyse,
  As soun that comth of pype or harpe.
  For whan a pype is blowen sharpe,
  The air is twist with violence,                                       775
  And rent; lo, this is my sentence;
  Eek, whan men harpe-stringes smyte,
  Whether hit be moche or lyte,                                       (270)
  Lo, with the strook the air to-breketh;
  Right so hit breketh whan men speketh.                                780
  Thus wost thou wel what thing is speche.
    'Now hennesforth I wol thee teche,

  I preve hit thus--tak hede now--
  By experience; for if that thou                                     (280)

  Wel wost thou, hit wol make anoon                                     790

  And right anoon thou shalt see weel,
  That wheel wol cause another wheel,
  And that the thridde, and so forth, brother,                          795

  Wyder than himselve was;
  And thus, fro roundel to compas,                                    (290)
  Ech aboute other goinge,
  Caused of othres steringe,                                            800

  And who-so seith of trouthe I varie,
  Bid him proven the contrarie.                                       (300)
  And right thus every word, y-wis,
  That loude or privee spoken is,                                       810
  Moveth first an air aboute,
  And of this moving, out of doute,
  Another air anoon is meved,
  As I have of the water preved,
  That every cercle causeth other.                                      815
  Right so of air, my leve brother;
  Everich air in other stereth

  Til hit be atte House of Fame;--
  Tak hit in ernest or in game.
    'Now have I told, if thou have minde,
  How speche or soun, of pure kinde,
  Enclyned is upward to meve;                                           825
  This, mayst thou fele, wel I preve.
  And that [the mansioun], y-wis,
  That every thing enclyned to is,                                    (320)
  Hath his kindeliche stede:
  That sheweth hit, withouten drede,                                    830

  Of every speche, of every soun,
  Be hit either foul or fair,
  Hath his kinde place in air.
  And sin that every thing, that is                                     835

  Moveth thider for to go
  If hit a-weye be therfro,                                           (330)
  As I before have preved thee,
  Hit seweth, every soun, pardee,                                       840

  Al up into his kindely place.
  And this place of which I telle,
  Ther as Fame list to dwelle,
  Is set amiddes of these three,                                        845

  As most conservatif the soun.
  Than is this the conclusioun,                                       (340)
  That every speche of every man,
  As I thee telle first began,                                          850
  Moveth up on high to pace
  Kindely to Fames place.
    'Telle me this feithfully,
  Have I not preved thus simply,

  At ones; wost thou not wel this?'
  And I answerde, and seyde, 'Yis.'

  Quod I, 'hit is; and lyk to be
  Right so as thou hast preved me.'
  'By god,' quod he, 'and as I leve,                                    875

    'How farest thou?' quod he to me.
  'Wel,' quod I. 'Now see,' quod he,                                  (380)

  In-mid the see, and ther he dreynte,
  For whom was maked moch compleynte.
    'Now turn upward,' quod he, 'thy face,                              925
  And behold this large place,
  This air; but loke thou ne be
  Adrad of hem that thou shalt see;                                   (420)
  For in this regioun, certein,
  Dwelleth many a citezein,                                             930
  Of which that speketh dan Plato.
  These ben the eyrish bestes, lo!'
  And so saw I al that meynee
  Bothe goon and also flee.
  'Now,' quod he tho, 'cast up thyn yë;                                 935
  See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë,
  Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,
  For hit is whyt: and somme, parfey,                                 (430)
  Callen hit Watlinge Strete:
  That ones was y-brent with hete,                                      940
  Whan the sonnes sone, the rede,
  That highte Pheton, wolde lede
  Algate his fader cart, and gye.
  The cart-hors gonne wel espye
  That he ne coude no governaunce                                       945
  And gonne for to lepe and launce,
  And beren him now up, now doun,
  Til that he saw the Scorpioun,                                      (440)
  Which that in heven a signe is yit.
  And he, for ferde, loste his wit,                                     950
  Of that, and leet the reynes goon
  Of his hors; and they anoon
  Gonne up to mounte, and doun descende
  Til bothe the eyr and erthe brende;
  Til Iupiter, lo, atte laste,                                          955
  Him slow, and fro the carte caste.
  Lo, is it not a greet mischaunce,
  To lete a fole han governaunce                                      (450)
  Of thing that he can not demeine?'
    And with this word, soth for to seyne,                              960
  He gan alway upper to sore,
  And gladded me ay more and more,
  So feithfully to me spak he.
    Tho gan I loken under me,
  And beheld the eyrish bestes,                                         965
  Cloudes, mistes, and tempestes,
  Snowes, hailes, reines, windes,
  And thengendring in hir kindes,                                     (460)
  And al the wey through whiche I cam;
  'O god,' quod I, 'that made Adam,                                     970
  Moche is thy might and thy noblesse!'
    And tho thoughte I upon Boëce,
  That writ, 'a thought may flee so hyë,
  With fetheres of Philosophye,
  To passen everich element;                                            975
  And whan he hath so fer y-went,
  Than may be seen, behind his bak,
  Cloud, and al that I of spak.'                                      (470)
    Tho gan I wexen in a were,
  And seyde, 'I woot wel I am here;                                     980
  But wher in body or in gost
  I noot, y-wis; but god, thou wost!'
  For more cleer entendement
  Nadde he me never yit y-sent.
  And than thoughte I on Marcian,                                       985
  And eek on Anteclaudian,
  That sooth was hir descripcioun
  Of al the hevenes regioun,                                          (480)
  As fer as that I saw the preve;
  Therfor I can hem now beleve.                                         990
    With that this egle gan to crye:
  'Lat be,' quod he, 'thy fantasye;
  Wilt thou lere of sterres aught?'
  'Nay, certeinly,' quod I, 'right naught;
  And why? for I am now to old.'                                        995
  'Elles I wolde thee have told,'
  Quod he, 'the sterres names, lo,
  And al the hevenes signes to,                                       (490)
  And which they been.' 'No fors,' quod I.
  'Yis, pardee,' quod he; 'wostow why?                                 1000
  For whan thou redest poetrye,
  How goddes gonne stellifye
  Brid, fish, beste, or him or here,
  As the Raven, or either Bere,
  Or Ariones harpe fyn,                                                1005

  Or Atlantes doughtres sevene,
  How alle these arn set in hevene;                                   (500)
  For though thou have hem ofte on honde,
  Yet nostow not wher that they stonde.'                               1010
  'No fors,' quod I, 'hit is no nede;
  I leve as wel, so god me spede,
  Hem that wryte of this matere,
  As though I knew hir places here;
  And eek they shynen here so brighte,                                 1015
  Hit shulde shenden al my sighte,
  To loke on hem.' 'That may wel be,'
  Quod he. And so forth bar he me                                     (510)
  A whyl, and than he gan to crye,
  That never herde I thing so hye,                                     1020
  'Now up the heed; for al is wel;
  Seynt Iulyan, lo, bon hostel!
  See here the House of Fame, lo!
  Maistow not heren that I do?'
  'What?' quod I. 'The grete soun,'                                    1025
  Quod he, 'that rumbleth up and doun
  In Fames Hous, ful of tydinges,
  Bothe of fair speche and chydinges,                                 (520)
  And of fals and soth compouned.
  Herkne wel; hit is not rouned.                                       1030
  Herestow not the grete swogh?'
  'Yis, pardee,' quod I, 'wel y-nogh.'
  'And what soun is it lyk?' quod he.
  'Peter! lyk beting of the see,'
  Quod I, 'again the roches holowe,                                    1035
  Whan tempest doth the shippes swalowe;
  And lat a man stonde, out of doute,
  A myle thens, and here hit route;                                   (530)
  Or elles lyk the last humblinge
  After the clappe of a thundringe,                                    1040
  When Ioves hath the air y-bete;
  But hit doth me for fere swete.'
  'Nay, dred thee not therof,' quod he,
  'Hit is nothing wil byten thee;
  Thou shalt non harm have, trewely.'                                  1045
    And with this word bothe he and I
  As nigh the place arryved were
  As men may casten with a spere.                                     (540)
  I nistë how, but in a strete
  He sette me faire on my fete,                                        1050
  And seyde, 'Walke forth a pas,
  And tak thyn aventure or cas,
  That thou shalt finde in Fames place.'
   'Now,' quod I, 'whyl we han space
  To speke, or that I go fro thee,                                     1055
  For the love of god, tel me,
  In sooth, that wil I of thee lere,

  Of folk that doun in erthe dwellen,                                  1060
  And comth here in the same wyse
  As I thee herde or this devyse;
  And that ther lyves body nis
  In al that hous that yonder is,
  That maketh al this loude fare?'                                     1065
  'No,' quod he, 'by Seynte Clare,
  And also wis god rede me!
  But o thinge I wil warne thee                                       (560)
  Of the which thou wolt have wonder.
  Lo, to the House of Fame yonder                                      1070
  Thou wost how cometh every speche,

  But understond now right wel this;
  Whan any speche y-comen is
  Up to the paleys, anon-right                                         1075

  And hath so verray his lyknesse
  That spak the word, that thou wilt gesse                             1080
  That hit the same body be,

  And is not this a wonder thing?'
  'Yis,' quod I tho, 'by hevene king!'
  And with this worde, 'Farwel,' quod he,                              1085

  And I of him took leve anoon,

INCIPIT LIBER TERCIUS.


          _Invocation._

  O god of science and of light,
  Apollo, through thy grete might,
  This litel laste book thou gye!
  Nat that I wilne, for maistrye,
  Here art poetical be shewed;                                         1095
  But, for the rym is light and lewed,
  Yit make hit sumwhat agreable,
  Though som vers faile in a sillable;
  And that I do no diligence
  To shewe craft, but o sentence.                                 (10) 1100
  And if, divyne vertu, thou
  Wilt helpe me to shewe now
  That in myn hede y-marked is--
  Lo, that is for to menen this,
  The Hous of Fame to descryve--                                       1105
  Thou shalt see me go, as blyve,
  Unto the nexte laure I see,
  And kisse hit, for hit is thy tree;
  Now entreth in my breste anoon!--

          _The Dream._

  Whan I was fro this egle goon,                                  (20) 1110
  I gan beholde upon this place.
  And certein, or I ferther pace,
  I wol yow al the shap devyse
  Of hous and site; and al the wyse
  How I gan to this place aproche                                      1115
  That stood upon so high a roche,
  Hyer stant ther noon in Spaine.
  But up I clomb with alle paine,
  And though to climbe hit greved me,
  Yit I ententif was to see,                                      (30) 1120
  And for to pouren wonder lowe,
  If I coude any weyes knowe
  What maner stoon this roche was;
  For hit was lyk a thing of glas,
  But that hit shoon ful more clere;                                   1125
  But of what congeled matere
  Hit was, I niste redely.
    But at the laste espyed I,
  And found that hit was, every deel,
  A roche of yse, and not of steel.                               (40) 1130
  Thoughte I, 'By Seynt Thomas of Kent!
  This were a feble foundement
  To bilden on a place hye;
  He oughte him litel glorifye
  That her-on bilt, god so me save!'                                   1135
    Tho saw I al the half y-grave
  With famous folkes names fele,
  That had y-been in mochel wele,
  And hir fames wyde y-blowe.
  But wel unethes coude I knowe                                   (50) 1140
  Any lettres for to rede
  Hir names by; for, out of drede,
  They were almost of-thowed so,
  That of the lettres oon or two
  Was molte away of every name;                                        1145
  So unfamous was wexe hir fame;
  But men seyn, 'What may ever laste?'
    Tho gan I in myn herte caste,
  That they were molte awey with hete,
  And not awey with stormes bete.                                 (60) 1150
  For on that other syde I sey
  Of this hille, that northward lay,
  How hit was writen ful of names
  Of folk that hadden grete fames
  Of olde tyme, and yit they were                                      1155
  As fresshe as men had writen hem there
  The selve day right, or that houre
  That I upon hem gan to poure.
  But wel I wiste what hit made;
  Hit was conserved with the shade--                              (70) 1160
  Al this wrytinge that I sy--
  Of a castel, that stood on by,
  And stood eek on so cold a place,
  That hete mighte hit not deface.
    Tho gan I up the hille to goon,                                    1165
  And fond upon the coppe a woon,
  That alle the men that ben on lyve
  Ne han the cunning to descryve
  The beautee of that ilke place,
  Ne coude casten no compace                                      (80) 1170
  Swich another for to make,
  That mighte of beautee be his make,
  Ne [be] so wonderliche y-wrought;
  That hit astonieth yit my thought,
  And maketh al my wit to swinke                                       1175
  On this castel to bethinke.
  So that the grete craft, beautee,
  The cast, the curiositee
  Ne can I not to yow devyse,
  My wit ne may me not suifyse.                                   (90) 1180
    But natheles al the substance
  I have yit in my remembrance:
  For-why me thoughte, by Seynt Gyle!
  Al was of stone of beryle,
  Bothe castel and the tour,                                           1185
  And eek the halle, and every bour,
  Withouten peces or Ioininges.
  But many subtil compassinges,
  Babewinnes and pinacles,
  Imageries and tabernacles,                                     (100) 1190
  I saw; and ful eek of windowes,
  As flakes falle in grete snowes.
  And eek in ech of the pinacles
  Weren sondry habitacles,
  In whiche stoden, al withoute--                                      1195
  Ful the castel, al aboute--
  Of alle maner of minstrales,
  And gestiours, that tellen tales
  Bothe of weping and of game,
  Of al that longeth unto Fame.                                  (110) 1200
    Ther herde I pleyen on an harpe
  That souned bothe wel and sharpe,
  Orpheus ful craftely,
  And on his syde, faste by,
  Sat the harper Orion,                                                1205
  And Eacides Chiron,
  And other harpers many oon,
  And the Bret Glascurion;
  And smale harpers with her gleës
  Seten under hem in seës,                                       (120) 1210
  And gonne on hem upward to gape,
  And countrefete hem as an ape,
  Or as craft countrefeteth kinde.
    Tho saugh I stonden hem behinde,
  A-fer fro hem, al by hemselve,                                       1215
  Many thousand tymes twelve,
  That maden loude menstralcyes
  In cornemuse and shalmyes,
  And many other maner pype,
  That craftely begunne pype                                     (130) 1220
  Bothe in doucet and in rede,
  That ben at festes with the brede;
  And many floute and lilting-horne,
  And pypes made of grene corne,
  As han thise litel herde-gromes,                                     1225
  That kepen bestes in the bromes.
    Ther saugh I than Atiteris,
  And of Athenes dan Pseustis,
  And Marcia that lost her skin,
  Bothe in face, body, and chin,                                 (140) 1230
  For that she wolde envyen, lo!
  To pypen bet then Apollo.
  Ther saugh I famous, olde and yonge,
  Pypers of the Duche tonge,
  To lerne love-daunces, springes,                                     1235
  Reyes, and these straunge thinges.
    Tho saugh I in another place
  Stonden in a large space,
  Of hem that maken blody soun
  In trumpe, beme, and clarioun;                                 (150) 1240
  For in fight and blood-shedinge
  Is used gladly clarioninge.
    Ther herde I trumpen Messenus,
  Of whom that speketh Virgilius.
  Ther herde I Ioab trumpe also,                                       1245
  Theodomas, and other mo;
  And alle that used clarion
  In Cataloigne and Aragon,
  That in hir tyme famous were
  To lerne, saugh I trumpe there.                                (160) 1250
    Ther saugh I sitte in other seës,
  Pleyinge upon sondry gleës,
  Whiche that I cannot nevene,
  Mo then sterres been in hevene,
  Of whiche I nil as now not ryme,                                     1255
  For ese of yow, and losse of tyme:
  For tyme y-lost, this knowen ye,
  By no way may recovered be.
    Ther saugh I pleyen Iogelours,
  Magiciens and tregetours,                                      (170) 1260
  And phitonesses, charmeresses,
  Olde wicches, sorceresses,
  That use exorsisaciouns,
  And eek thise fumigaciouns;
  And clerkes eek, which conne wel                                     1265
  Al this magyke naturel,
  That craftely don hir ententes,
  To make, in certeyn ascendentes,
  Images, lo, through which magyk
  To make a man ben hool or syk.                                 (180) 1270
  Ther saugh I thee, queen Medea,
  And Circes eke, and Calipsa;
  Ther saugh I Hermes Ballenus,
  Lymote, and eek Simon Magus.
  Ther saugh I, and knew hem by name,                                  1275
  That by such art don men han fame.
  Ther saugh I Colle tregetour
  Upon a table of sicamour
  Pleye an uncouthe thing to telle;
  I saugh him carien a wind-melle                                (190) 1280
  Under a walsh-note shale.
    What shuld I make lenger tale
  Of al the peple that I say,
  Fro hennes in-to domesday?
    Whan I had al this folk beholde,                                   1285
  And fond me lous, and noght y-holde,
  And eft y-mused longe whyle
  Upon these walles of beryle,
  That shoon ful lighter than a glas,
  And made wel more than hit was                                 (200) 1290
  To semen, every thing, y-wis,
  As kinde thing of fames is;
  I gan forth romen til I fond
  The castel-yate on my right hond,
  Which that so wel corven was                                         1295
  That never swich another nas;
  And yit hit was by aventure
  Y-wrought, as often as by cure.
    Hit nedeth noght yow for to tellen,
  To make yow to longe dwellen,                                  (210) 1300
  Of this yates florisshinges,
  Ne of compasses, ne of kervinges,
  Ne how they hatte in masoneries,
  As, corbets fulle of imageries.
  But, lord! so fair hit was to shewe,                                 1305
  For hit was al with gold behewe.
  But in I wente, and that anoon;
  Ther mette I crying many oon,--
  'A larges, larges, hold up wel!
  God save the lady of this pel,                                 (220) 1310
  Our owne gentil lady Fame,
  And hem that wilnen to have name
  Of us!' Thus herde I cryen alle,
  And faste comen out of halle,
  And shoken nobles and sterlinges.                                    1315
  And somme crouned were as kinges,
  With crounes wroght ful of losenges;
  And many riban, and many frenges
  Were on hir clothes trewely.
    Tho atte laste aspyed I                                      (230) 1320
  That pursevauntes and heraudes,
  That cryen riche folkes laudes,
  Hit weren alle; and every man
  Of hem, as I yow tellen can,
  Had on him throwen a vesture,                                        1325
  Which that men clepe a cote-armure,
  Enbrowded wonderliche riche,
  Al-though they nere nought y-liche.
  But noght nil I, so mote I thryve,
  Been aboute to discryve                                        (240) 1330
  Al these armes that ther weren,
  That they thus on hir cotes beren,
  For hit to me were impossible;
  Men mighte make of hem a bible
  Twenty foot thikke, as I trowe.                                      1335
  For certeyn, who-so coude y-knowe
  Mighte ther alle the armes seen
  Of famous folk that han y-been
  In Auffrike, Europe, and Asye,
  Sith first began the chevalrye.                                (250) 1340
    Lo! how shulde I now telle al this?
  Ne of the halle eek what nede is
  To tellen yow, that every wal
  Of hit, and floor, and roof and al
  Was plated half a fote thikke                                        1345
  Of gold, and that nas no-thing wikke,
  But, for to prove in alle wyse,
  As fyn as ducat in Venyse,
  Of whiche to lyte al in my pouche is?
  And they wer set as thikke of nouchis                          (260) 1350
  Fulle of the fynest stones faire,
  That men rede in the Lapidaire,
  As greses growen in a mede;
  But hit were al to longe to rede
  The names; and therfore I pace.                                      1355
    But in this riche lusty place,
  That Fames halle called was,
  Ful moche prees of folk ther nas,
  Ne crouding, for to mochil prees.
  But al on hye, above a dees,                                   (270) 1360
  Sitte in a see imperial,
  That maad was of a rubee al,
  Which that a carbuncle is y-called,
  I saugh, perpetually y-stalled,
  A feminyne creature;                                                 1365
  That never formed by nature
  Nas swich another thing y-seye.
  For altherfirst, soth for to seye,
  Me thoughte that she was so lyte,
  That the lengthe of a cubyte                                   (280) 1370
  Was lenger than she semed be;
  But thus sone, in a whyle, she
  Hir tho so wonderliche streighte,
  That with hir feet she therthe reighte,
  And with hir heed she touched hevene,                                1375
  Ther as shynen sterres sevene.
  And ther-to eek, as to my wit,
  I saugh a gretter wonder yit,
  Upon hir eyen to beholde;
  But certeyn I hem never tolde;                                 (290) 1380
  For as fele eyen hadde she
  As fetheres upon foules be,
  Or weren on the bestes foure,
  That goddes trone gunne honoure,
  As Iohn writ in thapocalips.                                         1385
  Hir heer, that oundy was and crips,
  As burned gold hit shoon to see.
  And sooth to tellen, also she
  Had also fele up-stonding eres
  And tonges, as on bestes heres;                                (300) 1390
  And on hir feet wexen saugh I
  Partriches winges redely.
    But, lord! the perrie and the richesse
  I saugh sitting on this goddesse!
  And, lord! the hevenish melodye                                      1395
  Of songes, ful of armonye,
  I herde aboute her trone y-songe,
  That al the paleys-walles ronge!
  So song the mighty Muse, she
  That cleped is Caliopee,                                       (310) 1400
  And hir eighte sustren eke,
  That in hir face semen meke;
  And evermo, eternally,
  They songe of Fame, as tho herde I:--
  'Heried be thou and thy name,                                        1405
  Goddesse of renoun and of fame!'
    Tho was I war, lo, atte laste,
  As I myn eyen gan up caste,
  That this ilke noble quene
  On hir shuldres gan sustene                                    (320) 1410
  Bothe tharmes and the name
  Of tho that hadde large fame;
  Alexander, and Hercules
  That with a sherte his lyf lees!
  Thus fond I sitting this goddesse,                                   1415
  In nobley, honour, and richesse;
  Of which I stinte a whyle now,
  Other thing to tellen yow.
    Tho saugh I stonde on either syde,
  Streight doun to the dores wyde,                               (330) 1420
  Fro the dees, many a pileer
  Of metal, that shoon not ful cleer;
  But though they nere of no richesse,
  Yet they were maad for greet noblesse,
  And in hem greet [and hy] sentence;                                  1425
  And folk of digne reverence,
  Of whiche I wol yow telle fonde,
  Upon the piler saugh I stonde.
    Alderfirst, lo, ther I sigh,
  Upon a piler stonde on high,                                   (340) 1430
  That was of lede and yren fyn,
  Him of secte Saturnyn,
  The Ebrayk Iosephus, the olde,
  That of Iewes gestes tolde;
  And bar upon his shuldres hye                                        1435
  The fame up of the Iewerye.
  And by him stoden other sevene,
  Wyse and worthy for to nevene,
  To helpen him here up the charge,
  Hit was so hevy and so large.                                  (350) 1440
  And for they writen of batailes,
  As wel as other olde mervailes,
  Therfor was, lo, this pileer,
  Of which that I yow telle heer,
  Of lede and yren bothe, y-wis.                                       1445
  For yren Martes metal is,
  Which that god is of bataile;
  And the leed, withouten faile,
  Is, lo, the metal of Saturne,
  That hath ful large wheel to turne.                            (360) 1450
  Tho stoden forth, on every rowe,
  Of hem which that I coude knowe,
  Thogh I hem noght by ordre telle,
  To make yow to long to dwelle.
    These, of whiche I ginne rede,                                     1455
  Ther saugh I stonden, out of drede:
  Upon an yren piler strong,
  That peynted was, al endelong,
  With tygres blode in every place,
  The Tholosan that highte Stace,                                (370) 1460
  That bar of Thebes up the fame
  Upon his shuldres, and the name
  Also of cruel Achilles.
  And by him stood, withouten lees,
  Ful wonder hye on a pileer                                           1465
  Of yren, he, the gret Omeer;
  And with him Dares and Tytus
  Before, and eek he, Lollius,
  And Guido eek de Columpnis,
  And English Gaufride eek, y-wis;                               (380) 1470
  And ech of these, as have I Ioye,
  Was besy for to bere up Troye.
  So hevy ther-of was the fame,
  That for to bere hit was no game.
  But yit I gan ful wel espye,                                         1475
  Betwix hem was a litel envye.
  Oon seyde, Omere made lyes,
  Feyninge in his poetryes,
  And was to Grekes favorable;
  Therfor held he hit but fable.                                 (390) 1480
    Tho saugh I stonde on a pileer,
  That was of tinned yren cleer,
  That Latin poete, [dan] Virgyle,
  That bore hath up a longe whyle
  The fame of Pius Eneas.                                              1485
    And next him on a piler was,
  Of coper, Venus clerk, Ovyde,
  That hath y-sowen wonder wyde
  The grete god of Loves name.
  And ther he bar up wel his fame,                               (400) 1490
  Upon this piler, also hye
  As I might see hit with myn yë:
  For-why this halle, of whiche I rede
  Was woxe on highte, lengthe and brede,
  Wel more, by a thousand del,                                         1495
  Than hit was erst, that saugh I wel.
    Tho saugh I, on a piler by,
  Of yren wroght ful sternely,
  The grete poete, daun Lucan,
  And on his shuldres bar up than,                               (410) 1500
  As highe as that I mighte see,
  The fame of Iulius and Pompee.
  And by him stoden alle these clerkes,
  That writen of Romes mighty werkes,
  That, if I wolde hir names telle,                                    1505
  Al to longe moste I dwelle.
    And next him on a piler stood
  Of soulfre, lyk as he were wood,
  Dan Claudian, the soth to telle,
  That bar up al the fame of helle,                              (420) 1510
  Of Pluto, and of Proserpyne,
  That quene is of the derke pyne.
    What shulde I more telle of this?
  The halle was al ful, y-wis,
  Of hem that writen olde gestes,                                      1515
  As ben on treës rokes nestes;
  But hit a ful confus matere
  Were al the gestes for to here,
  That they of write, and how they highte.
  But whyl that I beheld this sighte,                            (430) 1520
  I herde a noise aprochen blyve,
  That ferde as been don in an hyve,
  Agen her tyme of out-fleyinge;
  Right swiche a maner murmuringe,
  For al the world, hit semed me.                                      1525
    Tho gan I loke aboute and see,
  That ther com entring in the halle
  A right gret company with-alle,
  And that of sondry regiouns,
  Of alleskinnes condiciouns,                                    (440) 1530
  That dwelle in erthe under the mone,
  Pore and ryche. And also sone
  As they were come into the halle,
  They gonne doun on kneës falle
  Before this ilke noble quene,                                        1535
  And seyde, 'Graunte us, lady shene,
  Ech of us, of thy grace, a bone!'
  And somme of hem she graunted sone,
  And somme she werned wel and faire;
  And somme she graunted the contraire                           (450) 1540
  Of hir axing utterly.
  But thus I seye yow trewely,
  What hir cause was, I niste.
  For this folk, ful wel I wiste,
  They hadde good fame ech deserved,                                   1545
  Althogh they were diversly served;
  Right as hir suster, dame Fortune,
  Is wont to serven in comune.
    Now herkne how she gan to paye
  That gonne hir of hir grace praye;                             (460) 1550
  And yit, lo, al this companye
  Seyden sooth, and noght a lye.
    'Madame,' seyden they, 'we be
  Folk that heer besechen thee,
  That thou graunte us now good fame,                                  1555
  And lete our werkes han that name;
  In ful recompensacioun
  Of good werk, give us good renoun.'
    'I werne yow hit,' quod she anoon,
  'Ye gete of me good fame noon,                                 (470) 1560
  By god! and therfor go your wey.'
    'Alas,' quod they, 'and welaway!
  Telle us, what may your cause be?'
    'For me list hit noght,' quod she;
  'No wight shal speke of yow, y-wis,                                  1565
  Good ne harm, ne that ne this.'
  And with that word she gan to calle
  Hir messanger, that was in halle,
  And bad that he shulde faste goon,
  Up peyne to be blind anoon,                                    (480) 1570
  For Eolus, the god of winde;--
  'In Trace ther ye shul him finde,
  And bid him bringe his clarioun,
  That is ful dyvers of his soun,
  And hit is cleped Clere Laude,                                       1575
  With which he wont is to heraude
  Hem that me list y-preised be:
  And also bid him how that he
  Bringe his other clarioun,
  That highte Sclaundre in every toun,                           (490) 1580
  With which he wont is to diffame
  Hem that me list, and do hem shame.'
    This messanger gan faste goon,
  And found wher, in a cave of stoon,
  In a contree that highte Trace,                                      1585
  This Eolus, with harde grace,
  Held the windes in distresse,
  And gan hem under him to presse,
  That they gonne as beres rore,
  He bond and pressed hem so sore.                               (500) 1590
    This messanger gan faste crye,
  'Rys up,' quod he, 'and faste hye,
  Til that thou at my lady be;
  And tak thy clarions eek with thee,
  And speed thee forth.' And he anon                                   1595
  Took to a man, that hight Triton,
  His clariouns to bere tho,
  And leet a certeyn wind to go,
  That blew so hidously and hye,
  That hit ne lefte not a skye                                   (510) 1600
  In al the welken longe and brood.
    This Eolus no-wher abood
  Til he was come at Fames feet,
  And eek the man that Triton heet;
  And ther he stood, as still as stoon.                                1605
  And her-withal ther com anoon
  Another huge companye
  Of gode folk, and gunne crye,
  'Lady, graunte us now good fame,
  And lat our werkes han that name                               (520) 1610
  Now, in honour of gentilesse,
  And also god your soule blesse!
  For we han wel deserved hit,
  Therfor is right that we ben quit.'
    'As thryve I,' quod she, 'ye shal faile,                           1615
  Good werkes shal yow noght availe
  To have of me good fame as now.
  But wite ye what? I graunte yow,
  That ye shal have a shrewed fame
  And wikked loos, and worse name,                               (530) 1620
  Though ye good loos have wel deserved.
  Now go your wey, for ye be served;
  And thou, dan Eolus, let see!
  Tak forth thy trumpe anon,' quod she,
  'That is y-cleped Sclaunder light,                                   1625
  And blow hir loos, that every wight
  Speke of hem harm and shrewednesse,
  In stede of good and worthinesse.
  For thou shalt trumpe al the contraire
  Of that they han don wel or faire.'                            (540) 1630
    'Alas,' thoughte I, 'what aventures
  Han these sory creatures!
  For they, amonges al the pres,
  Shul thus be shamed gilteles!
  But what! hit moste nedes be.'                                       1635
    What did this Eolus, but he
  Tok out his blakke trumpe of bras,
  That fouler than the devil was,
  And gan this trumpe for to blowe,
  As al the world shulde overthrowe;                             (550) 1640
  That through-out every regioun
  Wente this foule trumpes soun,
  As swift as pelet out of gonne,
  Whan fyr is in the poudre ronne.
  And swiche a smoke gan out-wende                                     1645
  Out of his foule trumpes ende,
  Blak, blo, grenish, swartish reed,
  As doth wher that men melte leed,
  Lo, al on high fro the tuel!
  And therto oo thing saugh I wel,                               (560) 1650
  That, the ferther that hit ran,
  The gretter wexen hit began,
  As doth the river from a welle,
  And hit stank as the pit of helle.
  Alas, thus was hir shame y-ronge,                                    1655
  And giltelees, on every tonge.
    Tho com the thridde companye,
  And gunne up to the dees to hye,
  And doun on knees they fille anon,
  And seyde, 'We ben everichon                                   (570) 1660
  Folk that han ful trewely
  Deserved fame rightfully,
  And praye yow, hit mot be knowe,
  Right as hit is, and forth y-blowe.'
  'I graunte,' quod she, 'for me list                                  1665
  That now your gode werk be wist;
  And yit ye shul han better loos,
  Right in dispyt of alle your foos,
  Than worthy is; and that anoon:
  Lat now,' quod she, 'thy trumpe goon,                          (580) 1670
  Thou Eolus, that is so blak;
  And out thyn other trumpe tak
  That highte Laude, and blow hit so
  That through the world hir fame go
  Al esely, and not to faste,                                          1675
  That hit be knowen atte laste.'
    'Ful gladly, lady myn,' he seyde;
  And out his trumpe of golde he brayde
  Anon, and sette hit to his mouthe,
  And blew hit est, and west, and southe,                        (590) 1680
  And north, as loude as any thunder,
  That every wight hadde of hit wonder,
  So brode hit ran, or than hit stente.
  And, certes, al the breeth that wente
  Out of his trumpes mouthe smelde                                     1685
  As men a pot-ful bawme helde
  Among a basket ful of roses;
  This favour dide he til hir loses.
    And right with this I gan aspye,
  Ther com the ferthe companye--                                 (600) 1690
  But certeyn they were wonder fewe--
  And gonne stonden in a rewe,
  And seyden, 'Certes, lady brighte,
  We han don wel with al our mighte;
  But we ne kepen have no fame.                                        1695
  Hyd our werkes and our name,
  For goddes love! for certes we
  Han certeyn doon hit for bountee,
  And for no maner other thing.'
  'I graunte yow al your asking,'                                (610) 1700
  Quod she; 'let your werk be deed.'
    With that aboute I clew myn heed,
  And saugh anoon the fifte route
  That to this lady gonne loute,
  And doun on knees anoon to falle;                                    1705
  And to hir tho besoughten alle
  To hyde hir gode werkes eek,
  And seyde, they yeven noght a leek
  For fame, ne for swich renoun;
  For they, for contemplacioun                                   (620) 1710
  And goddes love, hadde y-wrought;
  Ne of fame wolde they nought.
    'What?' quod she, 'and be ye wood?
  And wene ye for to do good,
  And for to have of that no fame?                                     1715
  Have ye dispyt to have my name?
  Nay, ye shul liven everichoon!
  Blow thy trumpe and that anoon,'
  Quod she, 'thou Eolus, I hote,
  And ring this folkes werk by note,                             (630) 1720
  That al the world may of hit here.'
  And he gan blowe hir loos so clere
  In his golden clarioun,
  That through the world wente the soun,
  So kenely, and eek so softe;                                         1725
  But atte laste hit was on-lofte.
    Thoo com the sexte companye,
  And gonne faste on Fame crye.
  Right verraily, in this manere
  They seyden: 'Mercy, lady dere!                                (640) 1730
  To telle certein, as hit is,
  We han don neither that ne this,
  But ydel al our lyf y-be.
  But, natheles, yit preye we,
  That we mowe han so good a fame,                                     1735
  And greet renoun and knowen name,
  As they that han don noble gestes,
  And acheved alle hir lestes,
  As wel of love as other thing;
  Al was us never broche ne ring,                                (650) 1740
  Ne elles nought, from wimmen sent,
  Ne ones in hir herte y-ment
  To make us only frendly chere,
  But mighte temen us on bere;
  Yit lat us to the peple seme                                         1745
  Swiche as the world may of us deme,
  That wimmen loven us for wood.
  Hit shal don us as moche good,
  And to our herte as moche availe
  To countrepeise ese and travaile,                              (660) 1750
  As we had wonne hit with labour;
  For that is dere boght honour
  At regard of our grete ese.
  And yit thou most us more plese;
  Let us be holden eek, therto,                                        1755
  Worthy, wyse, and gode also,
  And riche, and happy unto love.
  For goddes love, that sit above,
  Though we may not the body have
  Of wimmen, yet, so god yow save!                               (670) 1760
  Let men glewe on us the name;
  Suffyceth that we han the fame.'
    'I graunte,' quod she, 'by my trouthe!
  Now, Eolus, with-outen slouthe,
  Tak out thy trumpe of gold, let see,                                 1765
  And blow as they han axed me,
  That every man wene hem at ese,
  Though they gon in ful badde lese.'
  This Eolus gan hit so blowe,
  That through the world hit was y-knowe.                        (680) 1770
    Tho com the seventh route anoon,
  And fel on kneës everichoon,
  And seyde, 'Lady, graunte us sone
  The same thing, the same bone,
  That [ye] this nexte folk han doon.'                                 1775
  'Fy on yow,' quod she, 'everichoon!
  Ye masty swyn, ye ydel wrecches,
  Ful of roten slowe tecches!
  What? false theves! wher ye wolde
  Be famous good, and no-thing nolde                             (690) 1780
  Deserve why, ne never roughte?
  Men rather yow to-hangen oughte!
  For ye be lyk the sweynte cat,
  That wolde have fish; but wostow what?
  He wolde no-thing wete his clowes.                                   1785
  Yvel thrift come on your Iowes,
  And eek on myn, if I hit graunte,
  Or do yow favour, yow to avaunte!
  Thou Eolus, thou king of Trace!
  Go, blow this folk a sory grace,'                              (700) 1790
  Quod she, 'anoon; and wostow how?
  As I shal telle thee right now;
  Sey: "These ben they that wolde honour
  Have, and do noskinnes labour,
  Ne do no good, and yit han laude;                                    1795
  And that men wende that bele Isaude
  Ne coude hem noght of love werne;
  And yit she that grint at a querne
  Is al to good to ese hir herte."'
    This Eolus anon up sterte,                                   (710) 1800
  And with his blakke clarioun
  He gan to blasen out a soun,
  As loude as belweth wind in helle.
  And eek therwith, [the] sooth to telle,
  This soun was [al] so ful of Iapes,                                  1805
  As ever mowes were in apes.
  And that wente al the world aboute,
  That every wight gan on hem shoute,
  And for to laughe as they were wode;
  Such game fonde they in hir hode.                              (720) 1810
    Tho com another companye,
  That had y-doon the traiterye,
  The harm, the gretest wikkednesse
  That any herte couthe gesse;
  And preyed hir to han good fame,                                     1815
  And that she nolde hem doon no shame,
  But yeve hem loos and good renoun,
  And do hit blowe in clarioun.
  'Nay, wis!' quod she, 'hit were a vyce;
  Al be ther in me no Iustyce,                                   (730) 1820
  Me listeth not to do hit now,
  Ne this nil I not graunte you.'
    Tho come ther lepinge in a route,
  And gonne choppen al aboute
  Every man upon the croune,                                           1825
  That al the halle gan to soune,
  And seyden: 'Lady, lefe and dere,
  We ben swich folk as ye mowe here.
  To tellen al the tale aright,
  We ben shrewes, every wight,                                   (740) 1830
  And han delyt in wikkednes,
  As gode folk han in goodnes;
  And Ioye to be knowen shrewes,
  And fulle of vyce and wikked thewes;
  Wherfor we preyen yow, a-rowe,                                       1835
  That our fame swich be knowe
  In alle thing right as hit is.'
    'I graunte hit yow,' quod she, 'y-wis.
  But what art thou that seyst this tale,
  That werest on thy hose a pale,                                (750) 1840
  And on thy tipet swiche a belle!'
  'Madame,' quod he, 'sooth to telle,
  I am that ilke shrewe, y-wis,
  That brende the temple of Isidis
  In Athenes, lo, that citee.'                                         1845
  'And wherfor didest thou so?' quod she.
  'By my thrift,' quod he, 'madame,
  I wolde fayn han had a fame,
  As other folk hadde in the toun,
  Al-thogh they were of greet renoun                             (760) 1850
  For hir vertu and for hir thewes;
  Thoughte I, as greet a fame han shrewes,
  Thogh hit be [but] for shrewednesse,
  As gode folk han for goodnesse;
  And sith I may not have that oon,                                    1855
  That other nil I noght for-goon.
  And for to gette of Fames hyre,
  The temple sette I al a-fyre.
  Now do our loos be blowen swythe,
  As wisly be thou ever blythe.'                                 (770) 1860
  'Gladly,' quod she; 'thou Eolus,
  Herestow not what they preyen us?'
  'Madame, yis, ful wel,' quod he,
  'And I wil trumpen hit, parde!'
  And tok his blakke trumpe faste,                                     1865
  And gan to puffen and to blaste,
  Til hit was at the worldes ende.
    With that I gan aboute wende;
  For oon that stood right at my bak,
  Me thoughte, goodly to me spak,                                (780) 1870
  And seyde: 'Frend, what is thy name?
  Artow come hider to han fame?'
  'Nay, for-sothe, frend!' quod I;
  'I cam noght hider, graunt mercy!
  For no swich cause, by my heed!                                      1875
  Suffyceth me, as I were deed,
  That no wight have my name in honde.
  I woot my-self best how I stonde;
  For what I drye or what I thinke,
  I wol my-selven al hit drinke,                                 (790) 1880
  Certeyn, for the more part,
  As ferforth as I can myn art.'
  'But what dost thou here than?' quod he.
  Quod I, 'that wol I tellen thee,
  The cause why I stondë here:--                                       1885
  Som newe tydings for to lere:--
  Som newe thinges, I not what,
  Tydinges, other this or that,
  Of love, or swiche thinges glade.
  For certeynly, he that me made                                 (800) 1890
  To comen hider, seyde me,
  I shulde bothe here and see,
  In this place, wonder thinges;
  But these be no swiche tydinges
  As I mene of.' 'No?' quod he.                                        1895
  And I answerde, 'No, pardee!
  For wel I wiste, ever yit,
  Sith that first I hadde wit,
  That som folk han desyred fame
  Dyversly, and loos, and name;                                  (810) 1900
  But certeynly, I niste how
  Ne wher that Fame dwelte, er now;
  Ne eek of hir descripcioun,
  Ne also hir condicioun,
  Ne the ordre of hir dome,                                            1905
  Unto the tyme I hider come.'
  '[Whiche] be, lo, these tydinges,
  That thou now [thus] hider bringes,
  That thou hast herd?' quod he to me;
  'But now, no fors; for wel I see                               (820) 1910
  What thou desyrest for to here.
  Com forth, and stond no longer here,
  And I wol thee, with-outen drede,
  In swich another place lede,
  Ther thou shalt here many oon.'                                      1915
    Tho gan I forth with him to goon
  Out of the castel, soth to seye.
  Tho saugh I stonde in a valeye,
  Under the castel, faste by,
  An hous, that _domus Dedali_,                                  (830) 1920
  That _Laborintus_ cleped is,
  Nas maad so wonderliche, y-wis,
  Ne half so queynteliche y-wrought.
  And evermo, so swift as thought,
  This queynte hous aboute wente,                                      1925
  That never-mo hit stille stente.
  And ther-out com so greet a noise,
  That, had hit stonden upon Oise,
  Men mighte hit han herd esely
  To Rome, I trowe sikerly.                                      (840) 1930
  And the noyse which that I herde,
  For al the world right so hit ferde,
  As doth the routing of the stoon
  That from thengyn is leten goon.
    And al this hous, of whiche I rede,                                1935
  Was made of twigges, falwe, rede,
  And grene eek, and som weren whyte,
  Swiche as men to these cages thwyte,
  Or maken of these paniers,
  Or elles hottes or dossers;                                    (850) 1940
  That, for the swough and for the twigges,
  This hous was also ful of gigges,
  And also ful eek of chirkinges,
  And of many other werkinges;
  And eek this hous hath of entrees                                    1945
  As fele as leves been on trees
  In somer, whan they grene been;
  And on the roof men may yit seen
  A thousand holes, and wel mo,
  To leten wel the soun out go.                                  (860) 1950
    And by day, in every tyde,
  Ben al the dores open wyde,
  And by night, echoon, unshette;
  Ne porter ther is non to lette
  No maner tydings in to pace;                                         1955
  Ne never reste is in that place,
  That hit nis fild ful of tydinges,
  Other loude, or of whispringes;
  And, over alle the houses angles,
  Is ful of rouninges and of Iangles                             (870) 1960
  Of werre, of pees, of mariages,
  Of reste, of labour, of viages,
  Of abood, of deeth, of lyfe,
  Of love, of hate, acorde, of stryfe,
  Of loos, of lore, and of winninges,                                  1965
  Of hele, of sekenesse, of bildinges,
  Of faire windes, of tempestes,
  Of qualme of folk, and eek of bestes;
  Of dyvers transmutaciouns
  Of estats, and eek of regiouns;                                (880) 1970
  Of trust, of drede, of Ielousye,
  Of wit, of winninge, of folye;
  Of plentee, and of greet famyne,
  Of chepe, of derth, and of ruyne;
  Of good or mis governement,                                          1975
  Of fyr, of dyvers accident.
    And lo, this hous, of whiche I wryte,
  Siker be ye, hit nas not lyte;
  For hit was sixty myle of lengthe;
  Al was the timber of no strengthe,                             (890) 1980
  Yet hit is founded to endure
  Whyl that hit list to Aventure,
  That is the moder of tydinges,
  As the see of welles and springes,--
  And hit was shapen lyk a cage.                                       1985
    'Certes,' quod I, 'in al myn age,
  Ne saugh I swich a hous as this.'
  And as I wondred me, y-wis,
  Upon this hous, tho war was I
  How that myn egle, faste by,                                   (900) 1990
  Was perched hye upon a stoon;
  And I gan streighte to him goon
  And seyde thus: 'I preye thee
  That thou a whyl abyde me
  For goddes love, and let me seen                                     1995
  What wondres in this place been;
  For yit, paraventure, I may lere
  Som good ther-on, or sumwhat here
  That leef me were, or that I wente.'
    'Peter! that is myn entente,'                                (910) 2000
  Quod he to me; 'therfor I dwelle;
  But certein, oon thing I thee telle,
  That, but I bringe thee ther-inne,
  Ne shalt thou never cunne ginne
  To come in-to hit, out of doute,                                     2005
  So faste hit whirleth, lo, aboute.
  But sith that Ioves, of his grace,
  As I have seyd, wol thee solace
  Fynally with [swiche] thinges,
  Uncouthe sightes and tydinges,                                 (920) 2010
  To passe with thyn hevinesse;
  Suche routhe hath he of thy distresse,
  That thou suffrest debonairly--
  And wost thy-selven utterly
  Disesperat of alle blis,                                             2015
  Sith that Fortune hath maad a-mis
  The [fruit] of al thyn hertes reste
  Languisshe and eek in point to breste--
  That he, through his mighty meryte,
  Wol do thee ese, al be hit lyte,                               (930) 2020
  And yaf expres commaundement,
  To whiche I am obedient,
  To furthre thee with al my might,
  And wisse and teche thee aright
  Wher thou maist most tydinges here;                                  2025
  Shaltow anoon heer many oon lere.'
    With this worde he, right anoon,
  Hente me up bitwene his toon,
  And at a windowe in me broghte,
  That in this hous was, as me thoghte--                         (940) 2030
  And ther-withal, me thoghte hit stente,
  And no-thing hit aboute wente--
  And me sette in the flore adoun.
  But which a congregacioun
  Of folk, as I saugh rome aboute                                      2035
  Some within and some withoute,
  Nas never seen, ne shal ben eft;
  That, certes, in the world nis left
  So many formed by Nature,
  Ne deed so many a creature;                                    (950) 2040
  That wel unethe, in that place,
  Hadde I oon foot-brede of space;
  And every wight that I saugh there
  Rouned ech in otheres ere
  A newe tyding prevely,                                               2045
  Or elles tolde al openly
  Right thus, and seyde: 'Nost not thou
  That is betid, lo, late or now?'
    'No,' quod [the other], 'tel me what;'--
  And than he tolde him this and that,                           (960) 2050
  And swoor ther-to that hit was sooth--
  'Thus hath he seyd'--and 'Thus he dooth'--
  'Thus shal hit be'--'Thus herde I seye'--
  'That shal be found'--' That dar I leye:'--
  That al the folk that is a-lyve                                      2055
  Ne han the cunning to discryve
  The thinges that I herde there,
  What aloude, and what in ere.
  But al the wonder-most was this:--
  Whan oon had herd a thing, y-wis,                              (970) 2060
  He com forth to another wight,
  And gan him tellen, anoon-right,
  The same that to him was told,
  Or hit a furlong-way was old,
  But gan somwhat for to eche                                          2065
  To this tyding in this speche
  More than hit ever was.
  And nat so sone departed nas
  That he fro him, that he ne mette
  With the thridde; and, or he lette                             (980) 2070
  Any stounde, he tolde him als;
  Were the tyding sooth or fals,
  Yit wolde he telle hit nathelees,
  And evermo with more encrees
  Than hit was erst. Thus north and southe                             2075
  Went every [word] fro mouth to mouthe,
  And that encresing ever-mo,
  As fyr is wont to quikke and go
  From a sparke spronge amis,
  Til al a citee brent up is.                                    (990) 2080
    And, whan that was ful y-spronge,
  And woxen more on every tonge
  Than ever hit was, [hit] wente anoon
  Up to a windowe, out to goon;
  Or, but hit mighte out ther pace,                                    2085
  Hit gan out crepe at som crevace,
  And fleigh forth faste for the nones.
    And somtyme saugh I tho, at ones,
  A lesing and a sad soth-sawe,
  That gonne of aventure drawe                                  (1000) 2090
  Out at a windowe for to pace;
  And, when they metten in that place,
  They were a-chekked bothe two,
  And neither of hem moste out go;
  For other so they gonne croude,                                      2095
  Til eche of hem gan cryen loude,
  'Lat me go first!' 'Nay, but lat me!
  And here I wol ensuren thee
  With the nones that thou wolt do so,
  That I shal never fro thee go,                                (1010) 2100
  But be thyn owne sworen brother!
  We wil medle us ech with other,
  That no man, be he never so wrothe,
  Shal han that oon [of] two, but bothe
  At ones, al beside his leve,                                         2105
  Come we a-morwe or on eve,
  Be we cryed or stille y-rouned.'
  Thus saugh I fals and sooth compouned
  Togeder flee for oo tydinge.
    Thus out at holes gonne wringe                              (1020) 2110
  Every tyding streight to Fame;
  And she gan yeven eche his name.
  After hir disposicioun,
  And yaf hem eek duracioun,
  Some to wexe and wane sone,                                          2115
  As dooth the faire whyte mone,
  And leet hem gon. Ther mighte I seen
  Wenged wondres faste fleen,
  Twenty thousand in a route,
  As Eolus hem blew aboute.                                     (1030) 2120
    And, lord! this hous, in alle tymes,
  Was ful of shipmen and pilgrymes,
  With scrippes bret-ful of lesinges,
  Entremedled with tydinges,
  And eek alone by hem-selve.                                          2125
  O, many a thousand tymes twelve
  Saugh I eek of these pardoneres,
  Currours, and eek messangeres,
  With boistes crammed ful of lyes
  As ever vessel was with lyes.                                 (1040) 2130
  And as I alther-fastest wente
  Aboute, and dide al myn entente
  Me for to pleye and for to lere,
  And eek a tyding for to here,
  That I had herd of som contree                                       2135
  That shal not now be told for me;--
  For hit no nede is, redely;
  Folk can singe hit bet than I;
  For al mot out, other late or rathe,
  Alle the sheves in the lathe;--                               (1050) 2140
  I herde a gret noise withalle
  In a corner of the halle,
  Ther men of love tydings tolde,
  And I gan thiderward beholde;
  For I saugh renninge every wight,                                    2145
  As faste as that they hadden might;
  And everich cryed, 'What thing is that?'
  And som seyde, 'I not never what.'
  And whan they were alle on an hepe,
  Tho behinde gonne up lepe,                                    (1060) 2150
  And clamben up on othere faste,
  And up the nose on hye caste,
  And troden faste on othere heles
  And stampe, as men don after eles.
    Atte laste I saugh a man,                                          2155
  Which that I [nevene] naught ne can;
  But he semed for to be
  A man of greet auctoritee....                                 (1068) 2158

THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.


The Prologue to this Poem exists in two different versions, which differ
widely from each other in many passages. The arrangement of the material is
also different.

For the sake of clearness, the earlier version is here called 'Text A,' and
the later version 'Text B.'

'Text A' exists in one MS. only, but this MS. is of early date and much
importance. It is the MS. marked Gg. 4. 27 in the Cambridge University
Library, and is here denoted by the letter 'C.' It is the same MS. as that
denoted by the abbreviation 'Cm.' in the footnotes to the Canterbury Tales
and Troilus and Criseyde. This text is printed in the _upper_ part of the
following pages. The footnotes give the MS. spellings, where these are
amended in the text.

'Text B' occupies the _lower_ part of the following pages. It follows the
Fairfax MS. mainly, which is denoted by 'F.' In many places, the inferior
spellings of this MS. are relegated to the footnotes, amended spellings
being given in the text. Various readings are given from Tn. (Tanner MS.
346); T. (Trinity MS., R. 3. 19); A. (Arch. Seld. B. 24 in the Bodleian
Library); Th. (Thynne's Edition, 1532); B. (Bodley MS. 638); P. (Pepys MS.
2006); and sometimes from C. (already mentioned) or Add. (Addit. 9832).

Lines which occur _in one text only_ are marked (in either text) by a
prefixed asterisk. Lines marked with a dagger (+) stand _just the same in
both texts_. The blank space after A 60 (p. 70) shews that there is nothing
in Text A corresponding to B 69-72. Where the corresponding matter is
transposed to another place, one or other text has a portion printed in
smaller type.


THE PROLOGE OF .IX. GOODE WIMMEN.

     A thousand sythes have I herd men telle,
  +That ther is Ioye in heven, and peyne in helle;
   And I acorde wel that hit be so;
   But natheles, this wot I wel also,
   That ther nis noon that dwelleth in this contree,                      5
   That either hath in helle or heven y-be,
  +Ne may of hit non other weyes witen,
  +But as he hath herd seyd, or founde hit writen;
  +For by assay ther may no man hit preve.
   But goddes forbode, but men shulde leve                               10
  +Wel more thing then men han seen with yë!
  +Men shal nat wenen every-thing a lyë
   For that he seigh it nat of yore ago.
   God wot, a thing is never the lesse so
  +Thogh every wight ne may hit nat y-see.                               15
  +Bernard the monk ne saugh nat al, parde!
    +Than mote we to bokes that we finde,
  +Through which that olde thinges been in minde,
  +And to the doctrine of these olde wyse,
  +Yeven credence, in every skilful wyse,                                20
   And trowen on these olde aproved stories
  +Of holinesse, of regnes, of victories,
  +Of love, of hate, of other sundry thinges,
  +Of whiche I may not maken rehersinges.
  +And if that olde bokes were a-weye,                                   25
  +Y-loren were of remembraunce the keye.
   Wel oghte us than on olde bokes leve,
   Ther-as ther is non other assay by preve.
     And, as for me, though that my wit be lyte,
  +On bokes for to rede I me delyte,                                     30
  +And in myn herte have hem in reverence;
   And to hem yeve swich lust and swich credence,
   That ther is wel unethe game noon
   That from my bokes make me to goon,
   But hit be other up-on the haly-day,                                  35
   Or elles in the Ioly tyme of May;
   Whan that I here the smale foules singe,
  +And that the floures ginne for to springe,
   Farwel my studie, as lasting that sesoun!
     Now have I therto this condicioun                                   40
  +That, of alle the floures in the mede,
  +Than love I most these floures whyte and rede,
  +Swiche as men callen daysies in our toun.
  +To hem have I so greet affeccioun,
  +As I seyde erst, whan comen is the May,                               45
  +That in my bed ther daweth me no day
  +That I nam up, and walking in the mede
   To seen these floures agein the sonne sprede,
   Whan hit up-riseth by the morwe shene,
  *The longe day, thus walking in the grene.                             50

           _From_ A. 55-58.
       This dayesye, of alle floures flour,                     (B. 53)
       Fulfild of vertu and of alle honour,
      +And ever y-lyke fair and fresh of hewe,
       As wel in winter as in somer newe--

   And whan the sonne ginneth for to weste,                     (B. 61)
   Than closeth hit, and draweth hit to reste.
   So sore hit is afered of the night,
  *Til on the morwe, that hit is dayes light.
   This dayesye, of alle floures flour,                                  55
   Fulfild of vertu and of alle honour,
  +And ever y-lyke fair and fresh of hewe,
   As wel in winter as in somer newe,
   Fain wolde I preisen, if I coude aright;                     (B. 67)
  *But wo is me, hit lyth nat in my might!                               60

   For wel I wot, that folk han her-beforn                      (B. 73)
  +Of making ropen, and lad a-wey the corn;
  +And I come after, glening here and there,
  +And am ful glad if I may finde an ere
   Of any goodly word that they han left.                                65
   And, if hit happe me rehersen eft
   That they han in her fresshe songes sayd,
   I hope that they wil nat ben evel apayd,
   Sith hit is seid in forthering and honour
   Of hem that either serven leef or flour.                              70
   For trusteth wel, I ne have nat undertake
   As of the leef, ageyn the flour, to make;
   Ne of the flour to make, ageyn the leef,
  +No more than of the corn ageyn the sheef.
   For, as to me, is leefer noon ne lother;                              75
   I am with-holde yit with never nother.
   I not who serveth leef, ne who the flour;
   That nis nothing the entent of my labour.
   For this werk is al of another tunne,
   Of olde story, er swich stryf was begunne.                            80
  +But wherfor that I spak, to yeve credence                    (B. 97)
   To bokes olde and doon hem reverence,
   Is for men shulde autoritees beleve,
   Ther as ther lyth non other assay by preve.
  *For myn entent is, or I fro yow fare,                                 85
  *The naked text in English to declare
  *Of many a story, or elles of many a geste,
  *As autours seyn; leveth hem if yow leste!

   Whan passed was almost the month of May,                    (B. 108)
   And I had romed, al the someres day,                                  90
  *The grene medew, of which that I yow tolde,
   Upon the fresshe daysy to beholde,
   And that the sonne out of the south gan weste,
   And closed was the flour and goon to reste
   For derknesse of the night, of which she dredde,                      95
  +Hoom to myn hous ful swiftly I me spedde;
  +And, in a litel erber that I have,
   Y-benched newe with turves fresshe y-grave,
  +I bad men shulde me my couche make;
  +For deyntee of the newe someres sake,                                100
  +I bad hem strowe floures on my bed.
  +Whan I was layd, and had myn eyen hed,

   Me mette how I was in the medew tho,
  *And that I romed in that same gyse,                                  105
   To seen that flour, as ye han herd devyse.
  *Fair was this medew, as thoughte me overal;
   With floures swote enbrowded was it al;

   For hit surmounted pleynly alle odoures,
  +And eek of riche beaute alle floures.
  +Forgeten had the erthe his pore estat
  +Of winter, that him naked made and mat,
   And with his swerd of cold so sore had greved.                       115

   And of the newe blisful someres sake,                                130

  +With the whyte coroun, clad in grene;

  *And this thing was nat kept for holinesse,

  *Al ne is nat gospel that is to yow pleyned;

       This man to yow may wrongly been accused,
      +Ther as by right him oghte been excused;

  +For in your court is many a losengeour,

   That tabouren in your eres many a thing                              330
   For hate, or for Ielous imagining,

   Or elles, sir, for that this man is nyce,                            340
   He may translate a thing in no malyce.
   But for he useth bokes for to make,
   And takth non heed of what matere he take;
  *Therfor he wroot the Rose and eek Crisseyde
  *Of innocence, and niste what he seyde;                               345
  +Or him was boden make thilke tweye

  +As thogh that he of malice wolde endyten

  +A king to kepe his liges in Iustyce;
  +With-outen doute, that is his offyce.
  *And therto is a king ful depe y-sworn,

   And for to kepe his lordes hir degree,                               370
  +As hit is right and skilful that they be

   This shal he doon, bothe to pore [and] riche,

  +And han of pore folk compassioun.

  +For, sir, hit is no maystrie for a lord

  +And if so be he may him nat excuse,
   [But] axeth mercy with a sorweful herte,                             390
  +And profreth him, right in his bare sherte,

  +To serve you, in preysing of your name.
  +He made the book that hight the Hous of Fame,                        405
  +And eek the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse,

     +'Now as ye been a god, and eek a king,

  +And forthren yow, as muche as he misseyde                            430
  +Or in the Rose or elles in Crisseyde.'
     +The god of love answerde hir thus anoon,

  +Go thanke now my lady heer,' quod he.
     +I roos, and doun I sette me on my knee,                           445
  +And seyde thus: 'Madame, the god above

     +'That is a trewe tale, by myn hood,'                              495
  +Quod Love, 'and that thou knowest wel, pardee,
  +If hit be so that thou avyse thee.
  +Hastow nat in a book, lyth in thy cheste,
  +The grete goodnesse of the quene Alceste,
  +That turned was into a dayesye:                                      500
  +She that for hir husbonde chees to dye,
  +And eek to goon to helle, rather than he,
  +And Ercules rescued hir, pardee,
  +And broghte hir out of helle agayn to blis?'
     +And I answerde ageyn, and seyde, 'yis,                            505
  +Now knowe I hir! And is this good Alceste,
  +The dayesye, and myn owne hertes reste?
  +Now fele I wel the goodnesse of this wyf,
  +That bothe after hir deeth, and in hir lyf,
  +Hir grete bountee doubleth hir renoun!                               510
  +Wel hath she quit me myn affeccioun
  +That I have to hir flour, the dayesye!
  +No wonder is thogh Iove hir stellifye,
  +As telleth Agaton, for hir goodnesse!
  +Hir whyte coroun berth of hit witnesse;                              515
  +For also many vertues hadde she,
  +As smale floures in hir coroun be.
  +In remembraunce of hir and in honour,
  +Cibella made the dayesy and the flour
  +Y-coroned al with whyt, as men may see;                              520
  +And Mars yaf to hir coroun reed, pardee,
  +In stede of rubies, set among the whyte.'
     +Therwith this quene wex reed for shame a lyte,
  +Whan she was preysed so in hir presence.
  +Than seyde Love, 'a ful gret negligence                              525
   Was hit to thee, to write unstedfastnesse
  *Of women, sith thou knowest hir goodnesse
  *By preef, and eek by stories heer-biforn;
  *Let be the chaf, and wryt wel of the corn.
  *Why noldest thou han writen of Alceste,                              530
  *And leten Criseide been a-slepe and reste?
  *For of Alceste shulde thy wryting be,
   Sin that thou wost that kalender is she                     (B. 542)
   Of goodnesse, for she taughte of fyn lovinge,
  +And namely of wyfhood the livinge,                                   535
  +And alle the boundes that she oghte kepe;
  +Thy litel wit was thilke tyme a-slepe.
  +But now I charge thee, upon thy lyf,
  +That in thy Legend thou make of this wyf,
   Whan thou hast othere smale mad before;                              540
  +And fare now wel, I charge thee no more.                    (B. 551)
     +At Cleopatre I wol that thou beginne;                    (B. 566)
  +And so forth; and my love so shalt thou winne.'

   And with that word of sleep I gan a-awake,                  (B. 578)
  +And right thus on my Legend gan I make.                              545

THE PROLOGE OF .IX. GOODE WIMMEN.

     A thousand tymes have I herd men telle,
  +That ther is Ioye in heven, and peyne in helle;
   And I acorde wel that hit is so;
   But natheles, yit wot I wel also,
   That ther nis noon dwelling in this contree,                           5
   That either hath in heven or helle y-be,
  +Ne may of hit non other weyes witen,
  +But as he hath herd seyd, or founde hit writen;
  +For by assay ther may no man hit preve.
   But god forbede but men shulde leve                                   10
  +Wel more thing then men han seen with yë!
  +Men shal nat wenen every-thing a lyë
   But-if him-self hit seeth, or elles dooth;
   For, god wot, thing is never the lasse sooth,
  +Thogh every wight ne may hit nat y-see.                               15
  +Bernard the monk ne saugh nat al, parde!
    +Than mote we to bokes that we finde,
  +Through which that olde thinges been in minde.
  +And to the doctrine of these olde wyse,
  +Yeve credence, in every skilful wyse,                                 20
   That tellen of these olde appreved stories,
  +Of holinesse, of regnes, of victories,
  +Of love, of hate, of other sundry thinges,
  +Of whiche I may not maken rehersinges.
  +And if that olde bokes were a-weye,                                   25
  +Y-loren were of remembraunce the keye.
   Wel oghte us than honouren and beleve
   These bokes, ther we han non other preve.
     And as for me, thogh that I can but lyte,
  +On bokes for to rede I me delyte,                                     30
   And to hem yeve I feyth and ful credence,
  +And in myn herte have hem in reverence
   So hertely, that ther is game noon
   That fro my bokes maketh me to goon,
   But hit be seldom, on the holyday;                                    35
   Save, certeynly, whan that the month of May
   Is comen, and that I here the foules singe,
  +And that the floures ginnen for to springe,
   Farwel my book and my devocioun!
     Now have I than swich a condicioun,                                 40
  +That, of alle the floures in the mede,
  +Than love I most these floures whyte and rede,
  +Swiche as men callen daysies in our toun.
  +To hem have I so greet affeccioun,
  +As I seyde erst, whan comen is the May,                               45
  +That in my bed ther daweth me no day
  +That I nam up, and walking in the mede
   To seen this flour agein the sonne sprede,
   Whan hit upryseth erly by the morwe;
  *That blisful sighte softneth al my sorwe,                             50
  *So glad am I whan that I have presence
  *Of hit, to doon al maner reverence,
   As she, that is of alle floures flour,
   Fulfilled of al vertu and honour,
  +And ever y-lyke fair, and fresh of hewe;                              55
   And I love hit, and ever y-lyke newe,
  *And ever shal, til that myn herte dye;
  *Al swere I nat, of this I wol nat lye,
  *Ther loved no wight hotter in his lyve.
     *And whan that hit is eve, I renne blyve,                           60
   As sone as ever the sonne ginneth weste,
   To seen this flour, how it wol go to reste,
   For fere of night, so hateth she derknesse!

           _From_ B. 53-56.
       As she, that is of alle floures flour,
       Fulfilled of al vertu and honour,
      +And ever y-lyke fair, and fresh of hewe;
       And I love hit, and ever y-lyke newe.

  *Hir chere is pleynly sprad in the brightnesse
  *Of the sonne, for ther hit wol unclose.                               65
  *Allas! that I ne had English, ryme or prose,
   Suffisant this flour to preyse aright!
  *But helpeth, ye that han conning and might,
  *Ye lovers, that can make of sentement;
  *In this cas oghte ye be diligent                                      70
  *To forthren me somwhat in my labour,
  *Whether ye ben with the leef or with the flour.
   For wel I wot, that ye han her-biforn
  +Of making ropen, and lad awey the corn;
  +And I come after, glening here and there,                             75
  +And am ful glad if I may finde an ere
   Of any goodly word that ye han left.
   And thogh it happen me rehercen eft
   That ye han in your fresshe songes sayd,
   For-bereth me, and beth nat evel apayd,                               80
   Sin that ye see I do hit in the honour
   Of love, and eek in service of the flour,

           _From_ B. 188-196.
       But natheles, ne wene nat that I make
       In preysing of the flour agayn the leef,
      +No more than of the corn agayn the sheef.
       For as to me, nis lever noon ne lother;
       I nam with-holden yit with never nother.
       Ne I not who serveth leef, ne who the flour;
       Wel brouken they hir service or labour.
       For this thing is al of another tonne,
       Of olde story, er swich thing was begonne.

  *Whom that I serve as I have wit or might.
  *She is the clernesse and the verray light,
  *That in this derke worlde me wynt and ledeth,                         85
  *The herte in-with my sorowful brest yow dredeth,
  *And loveth so sore, that ye ben verrayly
  *The maistresse of my wit, and nothing I.
  *My word, my werk, is knit so in your bonde,
  *That, as an harpe obeyeth to the honde                                90
  *And maketh hit soune after his fingeringe,
  *Right so mowe ye out of myn herte bringe
  *Swich vois, right as yow list, to laughe or pleyne.
  *Be ye my gyde and lady sovereyne;
  *As to myn erthly god, to yow I calle,                                 95
  *Bothe in this werke and in my sorwes alle.
     +But wherfor that I spak, to give credence
   To olde stories, and doon hem reverence,
   And that men mosten more thing beleve
   Then men may seen at eye or elles preve?                             100
  *That shal I seyn, whan that I see my tyme;
  *I may not al at ones speke in ryme.
  *My besy gost, that thrusteth alwey newe
  *To seen this flour so yong, so fresh of hewe,
  *Constreyned me with so gledy desyr,                                  105
  *That in my herte I fele yit the fyr,
  *That made me to ryse er hit wer day--
   And this was now the firste morwe of May--
  *With dredful herte and glad devocioun,
  *For to ben at the resureccioun                                       110
  *Of this flour, whan that it shuld unclose
  *Agayn the sonne, that roos as rede as rose,
  *That in the brest was of the beste that day,
  *That Agenores doghter ladde away.
  *And doun on knees anon-right I me sette,                             115
  *And, as I coude, this fresshe flour I grette;
  *Kneling alwey, til hit unclosed was,
  *Upon the smale softe swote gras,

           _From_ B. 180, 182.
       The longe day I shoop me for to abyde ...
       But for to loke upon the dayesye.

           _From_ B. 197-200.
       Whan that the sonne out of the south gan weste,
       And that this flour gan close and goon to reste
       For derknesse of the night, the which she dredde,
      +Hoom to myn hous ful swiftly I me spedde;

           _From_ B. 203-211.
      +And, in a litel herber that I have,
       That benched was on turves fresshe y-grave,
      +I bad men sholde me my couche make;
      +For deyntee of the newe someres sake,
      +I bad hem strawen floures on my bed.
      +Whan I was leyd, and had my eyen hed,
       I fel on slepe in-with an houre or two;
       Me mette how I lay in the medew tho,
       To seen this flour, that I so love and drede,

   That was with floures swote enbrouded al,
  *Of swich swetnesse and swich odour over-al,                          120
   That, for to speke of gomme, or herbe, or tree,
  +Comparisoun may noon y-maked be;
   For hit surmounteth pleynly alle odoures,
  +And eek of riche beautee alle floures.
  +Forgeten had the erthe his pore estat                                125
  +Of winter, that him naked made and mat,
   And with his swerd of cold so sore greved;
   Now hath the atempre sonne al that releved
   That naked was, and clad hit new agayn.
  +The smale foules, of the seson fayn,                                 130

  +Had hem betrayed with his sophistrye.
  +This was hir song--'the fouler we defye,
   And al his craft!' And somme songen clere
   Layes of love, that Ioye hit was to here,                            140
   In worshipinge and preisinge of hir make.
   And, for the newe blisful somers sake,
  *Upon the braunches ful of blosmes softe,
  *In hir delyt, they turned hem ful ofte,
   And songen, 'blessed be seynt Valentyn!                              145
   For on his day I chees yow to be myn,
  +Withouten repenting, myn herte swete!'
  +And therwith-al hir bekes gonnen mete,
   Yelding honour and humble obeisaunces
   To love, and diden hir other observaunces                            150
   That longeth unto love and to nature;
  *Construeth that as yow list, I do no cure.
     *And tho that hadde doon unkindenesse--
  *As dooth the tydif, for new-fangelnesse--
  *Besoghte mercy of hir trespassinge,                                  155
  *And humblely songen hir repentinge,
  *And sworen on the blosmes to be trewe,
  *So that hir makes wolde upon hem rewe,
  *And at the laste maden hir acord.
  *Al founde they Daunger for a tyme a lord,                            160
  *Yet Pitee, through his stronge gentil might,
  *Forgaf, and made Mercy passen Right,
  *Through innocence and ruled curtesye.
  *But I ne clepe nat innocence folye,
  *Ne fals pitee, for 'vertu is the mene,'                              165
  *As Etik saith, in swich maner I mene.
  *And thus thise foules, voide of al malyce,
  *Acordeden to love, and laften vyce
  *Of hate, and songen alle of oon acord,
  *'Welcome, somer, our governour and lord!'                            170
    *And Zephirus and Flora gentilly
  *Yaf to the floures, softe and tenderly,
  *Hir swote breth, and made hem for to sprede,
  *As god and goddesse of the floury mede;
  *In which me thoghte I mighte, day by day,                            175
  *Dwellen alwey, the Ioly month of May,
  *Withouten sleep, withouten mete or drinke.
  *A-doun ful softely I gan to sinke;
  *And, leninge on myn elbowe and my syde,
   The longe day I shoop me for to abyde                                180
  *For nothing elles, and I shal nat lye,
   But for to loke upon the dayesye,
  *That wel by reson men hit calle may
  *The 'dayesye' or elles the 'ye of day,'
  *The emperice and flour of floures alle.                              185
  *I pray to god that faire mot she falle,
  *And alle that loven floures, for hir sake!
   But natheles, ne wene nat that I make
   In preysing of the flour agayn the leef,
  *No more than of the corn agayn the sheef:                            190
   For, as to me, nis lever noon ne lother;
   I nam with-holden yit with never nother.
   Ne I not who serveth leef, ne who the flour;
   Wel brouken they hir service or labour;
   For this thing is al of another tonne,                               195
   Of olde story, er swich thing was be-gonne.
     Whan that the sonne out of the south gan weste,
   And that this flour gan close and goon to reste
   For derknesse of the night, the which she dredde,
  +Hoom to myn hous ful swiftly I me spedde                             200
  *To goon to reste, and erly for to ryse,
   To seen this flour to sprede, as I devyse.
  +And, in a litel herber that I have,
   That benched was on turves fresshe y-grave,
  +I bad men sholde me my couche make;                                  205
  +For deyntee of the newe someres sake,
  +I bad hem strawen floures on my bed.
  +Whan I was leyd, and had myn eyen hed,
   I fel on slepe in-with an houre or two;
   Me mette how I lay in the medew tho,                                 210

   To seen this flour that I so love and drede.
   And from a-fer com walking in the mede
   The god of love, and in his hande a quene;
   And she was clad in real habit grene.
  +A fret of gold she hadde next hir heer,                              215
  +And upon that a whyt coroun she beer
   With florouns smale, and I shal nat lye;
   For al the world, ryght as a dayesye
  +Y-corouned is with whyte leves lyte,
   So were the florouns of hir coroun whyte;                            220
   For of o perle fyne, oriental,
  +Hir whyte coroun was y-maked al;
  +For which the whyte coroun, above the grene,
  +Made hir lyk a daysie for to sene,
   Considered eek hir fret of gold above.                               225
     +Y-clothed was this mighty god of love
   In silke, enbrouded ful of grene greves,
   In-with a fret of rede rose-leves,
  *The fresshest sin the world was first bigonne.
  *His gilte heer was corouned with a sonne,                            230
  *In-stede of gold, for hevinesse and wighte;
   Therwith me thoughte his face shoon so brighte
   That wel unnethes mighte I him beholde;
   And in his hande me thoughte I saugh him holde
  +Two fyry dartes, as the gledes rede;                                 235
   And aungellyke his winges saugh I sprede.
  +And al be that men seyn that blind is he,
   Al-gate me thoughte that he mighte see;
  +For sternely on me he gan biholde,
  +So that his loking doth myn herte colde.                             240
  +And by the hande he held this noble quene,
  +Corouned with whyte, and clothed al in grene,
  +So womanly, so benigne, and so meke,
  +That in this world, thogh that men wolde seke,
  +Half hir beautee shulde men nat finde                                245
  +In creature that formed is by kinde.

  +They setten hem ful softely adoun.

  +Ne nat a word was spoken in the place

  *Hit is my relik, digne and delytable,

  +To serve me, and holdest hit folye

  +And makest wyse folk fro me withdrawe.

   That maketh men to wommen lasse triste,
   That ben as trewe as ever was any steel.
  *Of thyn answere avyse thee right weel;                               335
   For, thogh that thou reneyed hast my lay,
   As other wrecches han doon many a day,
   By seynt Venus, that my moder is,
   If that thou live, thou shalt repenten this
   So cruelly, that hit shal wel be sene!'                              340
     Tho spak this lady, clothed al in grene,

   Who-so that goth, algate she wol nat wante.

           _From_ B. 350, 351.
       This man to yow may falsly been accused,
      +Ther as by right him oghte been excused.

   And eek, paraunter, for this man is nyce,
   He mighte doon hit, gessing no malyce,
   But for he useth thinges for to make;
   Him rekketh noght of what matere he take;                            365

  +Or him was boden maken thilke tweye
  +Of som persone, and durste hit nat with-seye;
  *Or him repenteth utterly of this.

  +To translaten that olde clerkes wryten,                              370
  +As thogh that he of malice wolde endyten
   Despyt of love, and had him-self hit wroght.
  +This shulde a rightwys lord have in his thoght,
  +And nat be lyk tiraunts of Lumbardye,
   Than han no reward but at tirannye.                                  375
  +For he that king or lord is naturel,
  +Him oghte nat be tiraunt ne cruel,
  +As is a fermour, to doon the harm he can.
  +He moste thinke hit is his lige man,

  *And is his tresour, and his gold in cofre.                           380
  +This is the sentence of the philosophre:
  +A king to kepe his liges in Iustyce;
  +With-outen doute, that is his offyce.
   Al wol he kepe his lordes hir degree,
  +As hit is right and skilful that they be                             385
  +Enhaunced and honoured, and most dere--
  +For they ben half-goddes in this world here--
   Yit mot he doon bothe right, to pore and riche,
   Al be that hir estat be nat y-liche,
  +And han of pore folk compassioun.                                    390
  +For lo, the gentil kynd of the leoun!
  +For whan a flye offendeth him or byteth,
  +He with his tayl awey the flye smyteth
  +Al esily; for, of his genterye,
  +Him deyneth nat to wreke him on a flye,                              395
  +As doth a curre or elles another beste.
  +In noble corage oghte been areste,
  +And weyen every thing by equitee,
  +And ever han reward to his owen degree.
  +For, sir, hit is no maystrie for a lord                              400
   To dampne a man with-oute answere of word;
  +And, for a lord, that is ful foul to use.
  +And if so be he may him nat excuse,
   But asketh mercy with a dredful herte,
  +And profreth him, right in his bare sherte,                          405
  +To been right at your owne Iugement,
  +Than oghte a god, by short avysement,
  +Considre his owne honour and his trespas.
  +For sith no cause of deeth lyth in this cas,
  +Yow oghte been the lighter merciable;                                410
  +Leteth your yre, and beth somwhat tretable!
  +The man hath served yow of his conning,
   And forthred wel your lawe in his making.
     'Al be hit that he can nat wel endyte,
   Yet hath he maked lewed folk delyte                                  415
  +To serve you, in preysing of your name.
  +He made the book that hight the Hous of Fame,
  +And eek the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse,
  +And the Parlement of Foules, as I gesse,
  +And al the love of Palamon and Arcyte                                420
  +Of Thebes, thogh the story is knowen lyte;
  +And many an ympne for your halydayes,
  +That highten Balades, Roundels, Virelayes;
   And, for to speke of other holynesse,
  +He hath in prose translated Boëce,                                   425

  +And mad the Lyf also of seynt Cecyle;
  +He made also, goon sithen a greet whyl,
  +Origenes upon the Maudeleyne;
  +Him oghte now to have the lesse peyne;
  +He hath mad many a lay and many a thing.                             430
     +'Now as ye been a god, and eek a king,
  +I, your Alceste, whylom quene of Trace,
  +I aske yow this man, right of your grace,
  +That ye him never hurte in al his lyve;
  +And he shal sweren yow, and that as blyve,                           435
  +He shal no more agilten in this wyse;
  +But he shal maken, as ye wil devyse,
  +Of wommen trewe in lovinge al hir lyve,
  +Wher-so ye wil, of maiden or of wyve,
  +And forthren yow, as muche as he misseyde                            440
  +Or in the Rose or elles in Creseyde.'
     +The god of love answerde hir thus anoon,
  +'Madame,' quod he, 'hit is so long agoon
  +That I yow knew so charitable and trewe,
  +That never yit, sith that the world was newe,                        445
  +To me ne fond I better noon than ye.

  +For who-so yeveth a yift, or doth a grace,
  +Do hit by tyme, his thank is wel the more;
  +And demeth ye what he shal do therfore.
  +Go thanke now my lady heer,' quod he.
     +I roos, and doun I sette me on my knee,                           455
  +And seyde thus: 'Madame, the god above
  +Foryelde yow, that ye the god of love

  +And yeve me grace so long for to live,
  +That I may knowe soothly what ye be                                  460
   That han me holpe and put in this degree.
  +But trewely I wende, as in this cas,

  +By swich ensample; this was my meninge.'
     +And she answerde, 'lat be thyn arguinge;                          475
  +For Love ne wol nat countrepleted be
   In right ne wrong; and lerne that of me!
  +Thou hast thy grace, and hold thee right ther-to.
  +Now wol I seyn what penance thou shalt do
  +For thy trespas, and understond hit here:                            480
  +Thou shalt, whyl that thou livest, yeer by yere,
   The moste party of thy tyme spende
  +In making of a glorious Legende
  +Of Gode Wommen, maidenes and wyves,
  +That weren trewe in lovinge al hir lyves;                            485
  +And telle of false men that hem bitrayen,
  +That al hir lyf ne doon nat but assayen
  +How many wommen they may doon a shame;
   For in your world that is now holde a game.
   And thogh thee lyke nat a lover be,                                  490
  +Spek wel of love; this penance yive I thee.
  +And to the god of love I shal so preye,
  +That he shal charge his servants, by any weye,
  +To forthren thee, and wel thy labour quyte;
   Go now thy wey, this penance is but lyte.                            495
  *And whan this book is maad, yive hit the quene
  *On my behalfe, at Eltham, or at Shene.'
     +The god of love gan smyle, and than he seyde,
  +'Wostow,' quod he, 'wher this be wyf or mayde,
  +Or quene, or countesse, or of what degree,                           500
  +That hath so litel penance yiven thee,
  +That hast deserved sorer for to smerte?
  +But pitee renneth sone in gentil herte;
  +That maystow seen, she kytheth what she is.'
  +And I answerde, 'nay, sir, so have I blis,                           505
  +No more but that I see wel she is good.'
     +'That is a trewe tale, by myn hood,'
  +Quod Love, 'and that thou knowest wel, pardee,
  +If hit be so that thou avyse thee.
  +Hastow nat in a book, lyth in thy cheste,                            510
  +The grete goodnesse of the quene Alceste,
  +That turned was into a dayesye:
  +She that for hir husbonde chees to dye,
  +And eek to goon to helle, rather than he,
  +And Ercules rescowed hir, pardee,                                    515
  +And broghte hir out of helle agayn to blis?'
     +And I answerde ageyn, and seyde, 'yis,
  +Now knowe I hir! And is this good Alceste,
  +The dayesye, and myn owne hertes reste?
  +Now fele I wel the goodnesse of this wyf,                            520
  +That bothe after hir deeth, and in hir lyf,
  +Hir grete bountee doubleth hir renoun!
  +Wel hath she quit me myn affeccioun
  +That I have to hir flour, the dayesye!
  +No wonder is thogh Iove hir stellifye,                               525
  +As telleth Agaton, for hir goodnesse!
  +Hir whyte coroun berth of hit witnesse;
  +For also many vertues hadde she,
  +As smale floures in hir coroun be.
  +In remembraunce of hir and in honour,                                530
  +Cibella made the dayesy and the flour
  +Y-coroned al with whyt, as men may see;
  +And Mars yaf to hir coroun reed, pardee,
  +In stede of rubies, set among the whyte.'
     +Therwith this quene wex reed for shame a lyte,                    535
  +Whan she was preysed so in hir presence.
  +Than seyde Love, 'a ful gret negligence
   Was hit to thee, that ilke tyme thou made
  *"Hyd, Absolon, thy tresses," in balade,
  *That thou forgete hir in thy song to sette,                          540
  *Sin that thou art so gretly in hir dette,
   And wost so wel, that kalender is she
  *To any woman that wol lover be.
   For she taughte al the craft of fyn lovinge,
  +And namely of wyfhood the livinge,                                   545
  +And alle the boundes that she oghte kepe;
  +Thy litel wit was thilke tyme a-slepe.
  +But now I charge thee, upon thy lyf,
  +That in thy Legend thou make of this wyf,
   Whan thou hast other smale y-maad before;                            550
  +And fare now wel, I charge thee no more.
     *'But er I go, thus muche I wol thee telle,
  *Ne shal no trewe lover come in helle.
  *Thise other ladies sittinge here arowe
  *Ben in thy balade, if thou canst hem knowe,                          555
  *And in thy bokes alle thou shalt hem finde;
  *Have hem now in thy Legend alle in minde,
  *I mene of hem that been in thy knowinge.
  *For heer ben twenty thousand mo sittinge
  *Than thou knowest, that been good wommen alle                        560
  *And trewe of love, for aught that may befalle;
  *Make the metres of hem as thee leste.
  *I mot gon hoom, the sonne draweth weste,
  *To Paradys, with al this companye;
  *And serve alwey the fresshe dayesye.                                 565
     +'At Cleopatre I wol that thou beginne;
  +And so forth; and my love so shalt thou winne.
  *For lat see now what man that lover be,
  *Wol doon so strong a peyne for love as she.
  *I wot wel that thou mayst nat al hit ryme,                           570
  *That swiche lovers diden in hir tyme;
  *It were to long to reden and to here;
  *Suffyceth me, thou make in this manere,
  *That thou reherce of al hir lyf the grete,
  *After thise olde auctours listen to trete.                           575
  *For who-so shal so many a storie telle,
  *Sey shortly, or he shal to longe dwelle.'
   And with that word my bokes gan I take,
  +And right thus on my Legend gan I make.

I. THE LEGEND OF CLEOPATRA.

INCIPIT LEGENDA CLEOPATRIE, MARTIRIS, EGIPTI REGINE.

  After the deeth of Tholomee the king,                                 580
  That al Egipte hadde in his governing,
  Regned his quene Cleopataras;
  Til on a tyme befel ther swiche a cas,
  That out of Rome was sent a senatour,
  For to conqueren regnes and honour                                    585
  Unto the toun of Rome, as was usaunce,
  To have the world unto her obeisaunce;
  And, sooth to seye, Antonius was his name.
  So fil hit, as Fortune him oghte a shame                             (10)
  Whan he was fallen in prosperitee,                                    590
  Rebel unto the toun of Rome is he.
  And over al this, the suster of Cesar,
  He lafte hir falsly, er that she was war,
  And wolde algates han another wyf;
  For whiche he took with Rome and Cesar stryf.                         595
    Natheles, for-sooth, this ilke senatour
  Was a ful worthy gentil werreyour,
  And of his deeth hit was ful greet damage.
  But love had broght this man in swiche a rage,                       (20)
  And him so narwe bounden in his las,                                  600
  Al for the love of Cleopataras,
  That al the world he sette at no value.
  Him thoughte, nas to him no thing so due
  As Cleopatras for to love and serve;
  Him roghte nat in armes for to sterve                                 605
  In the defence of hir, and of hir right.
    This noble quene eek lovede so this knight,
  Through his desert, and for his chivalrye;
  As certeinly, but-if that bokes lye,                                 (30)
  He was, of persone and of gentilesse,                                 610
  And of discrecioun and hardinesse,
  Worthy to any wight that liven may.
  And she was fair as is the rose in May.
  And, for to maken shortly is the beste,
  She wex his wyf, and hadde him as hir leste.                          615
    The wedding and the feste to devyse,
  To me, that have y-take swiche empryse
  Of so many a storie for to make,
  Hit were to long, lest that I sholde slake                           (40)
  Of thing that bereth more effect and charge;                          620
  For men may overlade a ship or barge;
  And forthy to theffect than wol I skippe,
  And al the remenant, I wol lete hit slippe.
    Octovian, that wood was of this dede,
  Shoop him an ost on Antony to lede                                    625
  Al-outerly for his destruccioun,
  With stoute Romains, cruel as leoun;
  To ship they wente, and thus I let hem saile.
    Antonius was war, and wol nat faile                                (50)
  To meten with thise Romains, if he may;                               630
  Took eek his reed, and bothe, upon a day,
  His wyf and he, and al his ost, forth wente
  To shippe anoon, no lenger they ne stente;
  And in the see hit happed hem to mete--
  Up goth the trompe--and for to shoute and shete,                      635
  And peynen hem to sette on with the sonne.
  With grisly soun out goth the grete gonne,
  And heterly they hurtlen al at ones,
  And fro the top doun cometh the grete stones.                        (60)
  In goth the grapenel so ful of crokes                                 640
  Among the ropes, and the shering-hokes.
  In with the polax presseth he and he;
  Behind the mast beginneth he to flee,
  And out agayn, and dryveth him over-borde;
  He stingeth him upon his speres orde;                                 645
  He rent the sail with hokes lyke a sythe;
  He bringeth the cuppe, and biddeth hem be blythe;
  He poureth pesen upon the hacches slider;
  With pottes ful of lym they goon to-gider;                           (70)
  And thus the longe day in fight they spende                           650
  Til, at the laste, as every thing hath ende,
  Antony is shent, and put him to the flighte,
  And al his folk to-go, that best go mighte.
    Fleeth eek the queen, with al her purpre sail,
  For strokes, which that wente as thikke as hail;                      655
  No wonder was, she mighte hit nat endure.
  And whan that Antony saw that aventure,
  'Allas!' quod he, 'the day that I was born!
  My worshipe in this day thus have I lorn!'                           (80)
  And for dispeyr out of his witte he sterte,                           660
  And roof him-self anoon through-out the herte
  Er that he ferther wente out of the place.
  His wyf, that coude of Cesar have no grace,
  To Egipte is fled, for drede and for distresse;
  But herkneth, ye that speke of kindenesse.                            665
    Ye men, that falsly sweren many an ooth
  That ye wol dye, if that your love be wrooth,
  Heer may ye seen of women whiche a trouthe!
  This woful Cleopatre hath mad swich routhe                           (90)
  That ther nis tonge noon that may hit telle.                          670
  But on the morwe she wol no lenger dwelle,
  But made hir subtil werkmen make a shryne
  Of alle the rubies and the stones fyne
  In al Egipte that she coude espye;
  And putte ful the shryne of spycerye,                                 675
  And leet the cors embaume; and forth she fette
  This dede cors, and in the shryne hit shette.
  And next the shryne a pit than doth she grave;
  And alle the serpents that she mighte have,                         (100)
  She putte hem in that grave, and thus she seyde:                      680
  'Now love, to whom my sorweful herte obeyde
  So ferforthly that, fro that blisful houre
  That I yow swor to been al frely youre,
  I mene yow, Antonius my knight!
  That never waking, in the day or night,                               685
  Ye nere out of myn hertes remembraunce
  For wele or wo, for carole or for daunce;
  And in my-self this covenant made I tho,
  That, right swich as ye felten, wele or wo,                         (110)
  As ferforth as hit in my power lay,                                   690
  Unreprovable unto my wyfhood ay,
  The same wolde I felen, lyf or deeth.
  And thilke covenant, whyl me lasteth breeth,
  I wol fulfille, and that shal wel be sene;
  Was never unto hir love a trewer quene.'                              695
  And with that word, naked, with ful good herte,
  Among the serpents in the pit she sterte,
  And ther she chees to han hir buryinge.
  Anoon the neddres gonne hir for to stinge,                          (120)
  And she hir deeth receyveth, with good chere,                         700
  For love of Antony, that was hir so dere:--
  And this is storial sooth, hit is no fable.
    Now, er I finde a man thus trewe and stable,
  And wol for love his deeth so freely take,
  I pray god lat our hedes never ake!                                   705

II. THE LEGEND OF THISBE OF BABYLON.

INCIPIT LEGENDA TESBE BABILONIE, MARTIRIS.

    At Babiloine whylom fil it thus,
  The whiche toun the queen Semiramus
  Leet dichen al about, and walles make
  Ful hye, of harde tyles wel y-bake.
  Ther weren dwellinge in this noble toun                               710
  Two lordes, which that were of greet renoun,
  And woneden so nigh, upon a grene,
  That ther nas but a stoon-wal hem bitwene,
  As ofte in grete tounes is the wone.
  And sooth to seyn, that o man hadde a sone,                           715
  Of al that londe oon of the lustieste.                               (11)
  That other hadde a doghter, the faireste,
  That estward in the world was tho dwellinge.
  The name of everich gan to other springe
  By wommen, that were neighebores aboute.                              720
  For in that contree yit, withouten doute,
  Maidens been y-kept, for Ielosye,
  Ful streite, lest they diden som folye.
    This yonge man was cleped Piramus,
  And Tisbe hight the maid, Naso seith thus;                            725
  And thus by report was hir name y-shove                              (21)
  That, as they wexe in age, wex hir love;
  And certein, as by reson of hir age,
  Ther mighte have been bitwix hem mariage,
  But that hir fadres nolde hit nat assente;                            730
  And bothe in love y-lyke sore they brente,
  That noon of alle hir frendes mighte hit lette
  But prively somtyme yit they mette
  By sleighte, and speken som of hir desyr;
  As, wry the gleed, and hotter is the fyr;                             735
  Forbede a love, and it is ten so wood.                               (31)
    This wal, which that bitwix hem bothe stood,
  Was cloven a-two, right fro the toppe adoun,
  Of olde tyme of his fundacioun;
  But yit this clifte was so narwe and lyte,                            740
  It as nat sene, dere y-nogh a myte.
  But what is that, that love can nat espye?
  Ye lovers two, if that I shal nat lye,
  Ye founden first this litel narwe clifte;
  And, with a soun as softe as any shrifte,                             745
  They lete hir wordes through the clifte pace,                        (41)
  And tolden, whyl that they stode in the place,
  Al hir compleynt of love, and al hir wo,
  At every tyme whan they dorste so.
    Upon that o syde of the wal stood he,                               750
  And on that other syde stood Tisbe,
  The swote soun of other to receyve,
  And thus hir wardeins wolde they deceyve.
  And every day this wal they wolde threte,
  And wisshe to god, that it were doun y-bete.                          755
  Thus wolde they seyn--'allas! thou wikked wal,                       (51)
  Through thyn envye thou us lettest al!
  Why nilt thou cleve, or fallen al a-two?
  Or, at the leste, but thou woldest so,
  Yit woldestow but ones lete us mete,                                  760
  Or ones that we mighte kissen swete,
  Than were we covered of our cares colde.
  But natheles, yit be we to thee holde
  In as muche as thou suffrest for to goon
  Our wordes through thy lyme and eek thy stoon.                        765
  Yit oghte we with thee ben wel apayd.'                               (61)
    And whan thise ydel wordes weren sayd,
  The colde wal they wolden kisse of stoon,
  And take hir leve, and forth they wolden goon.
  And this was gladly in the even-tyde                                  770
  Or wonder erly, lest men hit espyde;
  And longe tyme they wroghte in this manere
  Til on a day, whan Phebus gan to clere,
  Aurora with the stremes of hir hete
  Had dryed up the dew of herbes wete;                                  775
  Unto this clifte, as it was wont to be,                              (71)
  Com Pyramus, and after com Tisbe,
  And plighten trouthe fully in hir fey
  That ilke same night to stele awey,
  And to begyle hir wardeins everichoon,                                780
  And forth out of the citee for to goon;
  And, for the feldes been so brode and wyde,
  For to mete in o place at o tyde,
  They sette mark hir meting sholde be
  Ther king Ninus was graven, under a tree;                             785
  For olde payens that ydoles heried                                   (81)
  Useden tho in feldes to ben beried
  And faste by this grave was a welle.
  And, shortly of this tale for to telle,
  This covenant was affermed wonder faste;                              790
  And longe hem thoughte that the sonne laste,
  That hit nere goon under the see adoun.
    This Tisbe hath so greet affeccioun
  And so greet lyking Piramus to see,
  That, whan she seigh her tyme mighte be,                              795
  At night she stal awey ful prively                                   (91)
  With her face y-wimpled subtilly;
  For alle her frendes--for to save her trouthe--
  She hath for-sake; allas! and that is routhe
  That ever woman wolde be so trewe                                     800
  To trusten man, but she the bet him knewe!
  And to the tree she goth a ful good pas,
  For love made her so hardy in this cas;
  And by the welle adoun she gan her dresse.
  Allas! than comth a wilde leonesse                                    805
  Out of the wode, withouten more areste,                             (101)
  With blody mouthe, of strangling of a beste,
  To drinken of the welle, ther as she sat;
  And, whan that Tisbe had espyed that,
  She rist her up, with a ful drery herte,                              810
  And in a cave with dredful foot she sterte,
  For by the mone she seigh hit wel with-alle.
  And, as she ran, her wimpel leet she falle,
  And took noon heed, so sore she was a-whaped.
  And eek so glad of that she was escaped;                              815
  And thus she sit, and darketh wonder stille.                        (111)
  Whan that this leonesse hath dronke her fille,
  Aboute the welle gan she for to winde,
  And right anoon the wimpel gan she finde,
  And with her blody mouth hit al to-rente.                             820
  Whan this was doon, no lenger she ne stente,
  But to the wode her wey than hath she nome.
    And, at the laste, this Piramus is come,
  But al to longe, allas! at hoom was he.
  The mone shoon, men mighte wel y-see,                                 825
  And in his weye, as that he com ful faste,                          (121)
  His eyen to the grounde adoun he caste,
  And in the sonde, as he beheld adoun,
  He seigh the steppes brode of a leoun,
  And in his herte he sodeinly agroos,                                  830
  And pale he wex, therwith his heer aroos,
  And neer he com, and fond the wimpel torn.
  'Allas!' quod he, 'the day that I was born!
  This o night wol us lovers bothe slee!
  How sholde I axen mercy of Tisbe                                      835
  Whan I am he that have yow slain, allas!                            (131)
  My bidding hath yow slain, as in this cas.
  Allas! to bidde a woman goon by nighte
  In place ther as peril fallen mighte,
  And I so slow! allas, I ne hadde be                                   840
  Here in this place a furlong-wey or ye!
  Now what leoun that be in this foreste,
  My body mote he renden, or what beste
  That wilde is, gnawen mote he now myn herte!'
  And with that worde he to the wimpel sterte,                          845
  And kiste hit ofte, and weep on hit ful sore,                       (141)
  And seide, 'wimpel, allas! ther nis no more
  But thou shalt fele as wel the blood of me
  As thou hast felt the bleding of Tisbe!'
  And with that worde he smoot him to the herte.                        850
  The blood out of the wounde as brode sterte
  As water, whan the conduit broken is.
    Now Tisbe, which that wiste nat of this,
  But sitting in her drede, she thoghte thus,
  'If hit so falle that my Piramus                                      855
  Be comen hider, and may me nat y-finde,                             (151)
  He may me holden fals and eek unkinde.'
  And out she comth, and after him gan espyen
  Bothe with her herte and with her yën,
  And thoghte, 'I wol him tellen of my drede                            860
  Bothe of the leonesse and al my dede.'
  And at the laste her love than hath she founde
  Beting with his heles on the grounde,
  Al blody, and therwith-al a-bak she sterte,
  And lyke the wawes quappe gan her herte,                              865
  And pale as box she wex, and in a throwe                            (161)
  Avysed her, and gan him wel to knowe,
  That hit was Piramus, her herte dere.
  Who coude wryte whiche a deedly chere
  Hath Tisbe now, and how her heer she rente,                           870
  And how she gan her-selve to turmente,
  And how she lyth and swowneth on the grounde,
  And how she weep of teres ful his wounde,
  How medeleth she his blood with her compleynte,
  And with his blood her-selven gan she peynte;                         875
  How clippeth she the dede cors, allas?                              (171)
  How doth this woful Tisbe in this cas!
  How kisseth she his frosty mouth so cold!
  'Who hath doon this, and who hath been so bold
  To sleen my leef? O spek, my Piramus!                                 880
  I am thy Tisbe, that thee calleth thus!'
  And therwith-al she lifteth up his heed.
    This woful man, that was nat fully deed,
  Whan that he herde the name of Tisbe cryen,
  On her he caste his hevy deedly yën                                   885
  And doun again, and yeldeth up the gost.                            (181)
    Tisbe rist up, withouten noise or bost,
  And seigh her wimpel and his empty shethe,
  And eek his swerd, that him hath doon to dethe;
  Than spak she thus: 'My woful hand,' quod she,                        890
  'Is strong y-nogh in swiche a werk to me;
  For love shal yive me strengthe and hardinesse
  To make my wounde large y-nogh, I gesse.
  I wol thee folwen deed, and I wol be
  Felawe and cause eek of thy deeth,' quod she.                         895
  'And thogh that nothing save the deeth only                         (191)
  Mighte thee fro me departe trewely,
  Thou shalt no more departe now fro me
  Than fro the deeth, for I wol go with thee!
    'And now, ye wrecched Ielous fadres oure,                           900
  We, that weren whylom children youre,
  We prayen yow, withouten more envye,
  That in o grave y-fere we moten lye,
  Sin love hath brought us to this pitous ende!
  And rightwis god to every lover sende,                                905
  That loveth trewely, more prosperitee                               (201)
  Than ever hadde Piramus and Tisbe!
  And lat no gentil woman her assure
  To putten her in swiche an aventure.
  But god forbede but a woman can                                       910
  Been as trewe and loving as a man!
  And, for my part, I shal anoon it kythe!'
  And, with that worde, his swerd she took as swythe,
  That warm was of her loves blood and hoot,
  And to the herte she her-selven smoot.                                915
    And thus ar Tisbe and Piramus ago.                                (211)
  Of trewe men I finde but fewe mo
  In alle my bokes, save this Piramus,
  And therfor have I spoken of him thus.
  For hit is deyntee to us men to finde                                 920
  A man that can in love be trewe and kinde.
  Heer may ye seen, what lover so he be,
  A woman dar and can as wel as he.

III. THE LEGEND OF DIDO, QUEEN OF CARTHAGE.

INCIPIT LEGENDA DIDONIS MARTIRIS, CARTAGINIS REGINE.

  Glory and honour, Virgil Mantuan,
  Be to thy name! and I shal, as I can,                                 925
  Folow thy lantern, as thou gost biforn,
  How Eneas to Dido was forsworn.
  In thyn Eneïd and Naso wol I take
  The tenour, and the grete effectes make.
    Whan Troye broght was to destruccioun                               930
  By Grekes sleighte, and namely by Sinoun,
  Feyning the hors y-offred to Minerve,
  Through which that many a Troyan moste sterve;                       (10)
  And Ector had, after his deeth, appered,
  And fyr so wood, it mighte nat be stered,                             935
  In al the noble tour of Ilioun,
  That of the citee was the cheef dungeoun;
  And al the contree was so lowe y-broght,
  And Priamus the king fordoon and noght;
  And Eneas was charged by Venus                                        940
  To fleen awey, he took Ascanius,
  That was his sone, in his right hand, and fledde;
  And on his bakke he bar and with him ledde                           (20)
  His olde fader, cleped Anchises,
  And by the weye his wyf Creusa he lees.                               945
  And mochel sorwe hadde he in his minde
  Er that he coude his felawshippe finde.
  But, at the laste, whan he had hem founde,
  He made him redy in a certein stounde,
  And to the see ful faste he gan him hye,                              950
  And saileth forth with al his companye
  Toward Itaile, as wolde destinee.
  But of his aventures in the see                                      (30)
  Nis nat to purpos for to speke of here,
  For hit acordeth nat to my matere.                                    955
  But, as I seide, of him and of Dido
  Shal be my tale, til that I have do.
    So longe he sailed in the salte see
  Til in Libye unnethe aryved he,
  With shippes seven and with no more navye;                            960
  And glad was he to londe for to hye,
  So was he with the tempest al to-shake.
  And whan that he the haven had y-take,                               (40)
  He had a knight, was called Achates;
  And him of al his felawshippe he chees                                965
  To goon with him, the contre for tespye;
  He took with him no more companye.
  But forth they goon, and lafte his shippes ryde,
  His fere and he, with-outen any gyde.
  So longe he walketh in this wildernesse                               970
  Til, at the laste, he mette an hunteresse.
  A bowe in honde and arwes hadde she,
  Her clothes cutted were unto the knee;                               (50)
  But she was yit the fairest creature
  That ever was y-formed by nature;                                     975
  And Eneas and Achates she grette,
  And thus she to hem spak, whan she hem mette.
  'Sawe ye,' quod she, 'as ye han walked wyde,
  Any of my sustren walke yow besyde,
  With any wilde boor or other beste                                    980
  That they han hunted to, in this foreste,
  Y-tukked up, with arwes in her cas?'
    'Nay, soothly, lady,' quod this Eneas;                             (60)
  'But, by thy beaute, as hit thinketh me,
  Thou mightest never erthely womman be,                                985
  But Phebus suster artow, as I gesse.
  And, if so be that thou be a goddesse,
  Have mercy on our labour and our wo.'
    'I nam no goddes, soothly,' quod she tho;
  'For maidens walken in this contree here,                             990
  With arwes and with bowe, in this manere.
  This is the regne of Libie, ther ye been,
  Of which that Dido lady is and queen'--                              (70)
  And shortly tolde him al the occasioun
  Why Dido com into that regioun,                                       995
  Of which as now me lusteth nat to ryme;
  Hit nedeth nat; hit nere but los of tyme.
  For this is al and som, it was Venus,
  His owne moder, that spak with him thus;
  And to Cartage she bad he sholde him dighte,                         1000
  And vanished anoon out of his sighte.
  I coude folwe, word for word, Virgyle,
  But it wolde lasten al to longe a whyle.                             (80)
    This noble queen, that cleped was Dido,
  That whylom was the wyf of Sitheo,                                   1005
  That fairer was then is the brighte sonne,
  This noble toun of Cartage hath begonne;
  In which she regneth in so greet honour,
  That she was holde of alle quenes flour,
  Of gentilesse, of freedom, of beautee;                               1010
  That wel was him that mighte her ones see;
  Of kinges and of lordes so desyred,
  That al the world her beaute hadde y-fyred;                          (90)
  She stood so wel in every wightes grace.
    Whan Eneas was come un-to that place,                              1015
  Unto the maister-temple of al the toun
  Ther Dido was in her devocioun,
  Ful prively his wey than hath he nome.
  Whan he was in the large temple come,
  I can nat seyn if that hit be possible,                              1020
  But Venus hadde him maked invisible--
  Thus seith the book, with-outen any lees.
  And whan this Eneas and Achates                                     (100)
  Hadden in this temple been over-al,
  Than founde they, depeynted on a wal,                                1025
  How Troye and al the lond destroyed was.
  'Allas! that I was born,' quod Eneas,
  'Through-out the world our shame is kid so wyde,
  Now it is peynted upon every syde!
  We, that weren in prosperitee,                                       1030
  Be now disslaundred, and in swich degre,
  No lenger for to liven I ne kepe!'
  And, with that worde, he brast out for to wepe                      (110)
  So tendrely, that routhe hit was to sene.
  This fresshe lady, of the citee quene,                               1035
  Stood in the temple, in her estat royal,
  So richely, and eek so fair with-al,
  So yong, so lusty, with her eyen glade,
  That, if that god, that heven and erthe made,
  Wolde han a love, for beaute and goodnesse,                          1040
  And womanhod, and trouthe, and seemlinesse,
  Whom sholde he loven but this lady swete?
  There nis no womman to him half so mete.                            (120)
    Fortune, that hath the world in governaunce,
  Hath sodeinly broght in so newe a chaunce,                           1045
  That never was ther yit so fremd a cas.
  For al the companye of Eneas,
  Which that he wende han loren in the see,
  Aryved is, nat fer fro that citee;
  For which, the grettest of his lordes some                           1050
  By aventure ben to the citee come,
  Unto that same temple, for to seke
  The quene, and of her socour her beseke;                            (130)
  Swich renoun was ther spronge of her goodnesse.
  And, whan they hadden told al hir distresse,                         1055
  And al hir tempest and hir harde cas,
  Unto the quene appered Eneas,
  And openly beknew that hit was he.
  Who hadde Ioye than but his meynee,
  That hadden founde hir lord, hir governour?                          1060
    The quene saw they dide him swich honour,
  And had herd ofte of Eneas, er tho,
  And in her herte she hadde routhe and wo                            (140)
  That ever swich a noble man as he
  Shal been disherited in swich degree;                                1065
  And saw the man, that he was lyk a knight,
  And suffisaunt of persone and of might,
  And lyk to been a veray gentil man;
  And wel his wordes he besette can,
  And had a noble visage for the nones,                                1070
  And formed wel of braunes and of bones.
  For, after Venus, hadde he swich fairnesse,
  That no man might be half so fair, I gesse.                         (150)
  And wel a lord he semed for to be.
  And, for he was a straunger, somwhat she                             1075
  Lyked him the bet, as, god do bote,
  To som folk ofte newe thing is swote.
  Anoon her herte hath pitee of his wo,
  And, with that pitee, love com in also;
  And thus, for pitee and for gentilesse,                              1080
  Refresshed moste he been of his distresse.
  She seide, certes, that she sory was
  That he hath had swich peril and swich cas;                         (160)
  And, in her frendly speche, in this manere
  She to him spak, and seide as ye may here.                           1085
    'Be ye nat Venus sone and Anchises?
  In good feith, al the worship and encrees
  That I may goodly doon yow, ye shul have.
  Your shippes and your meynee shal I save;'
  And many a gentil word she spak him to;                              1090
  And comaunded her messageres go
  The same day, with-outen any faile,
  His shippes for to seke, and hem vitaile.                           (170)
  She many a beste to the shippes sente,
  And with the wyn she gan hem to presente;                            1095
  And to her royal paleys she her spedde,
  And Eneas alwey with her she ledde.
  What nedeth yow the feste to descryve?
  He never beter at ese was his lyve.
  Ful was the feste of deyntees and richesse,                          1100
  Of instruments, of song, and of gladnesse,
  And many an amorous loking and devys.
    This Eneas is come to Paradys                                     (180)
  Out of the swolow of helle, and thus in Ioye
  Remembreth him of his estat in Troye.                                1105
  To dauncing-chambres ful of parements,
  Of riche beddes, and of ornaments,
  This Eneas is lad, after the mete.
  And with the quene whan that he had sete,
  And spyces parted, and the wyn agoon,                                1110
  Unto his chambres was he lad anoon
  To take his ese and for to have his reste,
  With al his folk, to doon what so hem leste.                        (190)
    Ther nas coursere wel y-brydled noon,
  Ne stede, for the Iusting wel to goon,                               1115
  Ne large palfrey, esy for the nones,
  Ne Iuwel, fretted ful of riche stones,
  Ne sakkes ful of gold, of large wighte,
  Ne ruby noon, that shynede by nighte,
  Ne gentil hautein faucon heronere,                                   1120
  Ne hound, for hert or wilde boor or dere,
  Ne coupe of gold, with florins newe y-bete,
  That in the lond of Libie may be gete,                              (200)
  That Dido ne hath hit Eneas y-sent;
  And al is payed, what that he hath spent.                            1125
  Thus can this [noble] quene her gestes calle,
  As she that can in freedom passen alle.
    Eneas sothly eek, with-outen lees,
  Hath sent un-to his shippe, by Achates,
  After his sone, and after riche thinges,                             1130
  Both ceptre, clothes, broches, and eek ringes,
  Som for to were, and som for to presente
  To her, that all thise noble thinges him sente;                     (210)
  And bad his sone, how that he sholde make
  The presenting, and to the quene hit take.                           1135
    Repaired is this Achates again,
  And Eneas ful blisful is and fain
  To seen his yonge sone Ascanius.
  But natheles, our autour telleth us,
  That Cupido, that is the god of love,                                1140
  At preyere of his moder, hye above,
  Hadde the lyknes of the child y-take,
  This noble quene enamoured to make                                  (220)
  On Eneas; but, as of that scripture,
  Be as be may, I make of hit no cure.                                 1145
  But sooth is this, the quene hath mad swich chere
  Un-to this child, that wonder is to here;
  And of the present that his fader sente
  She thanked him ful ofte, in good entente.
    Thus is this quene in plesaunce and in Ioye,                       1150
  With al this newe lusty folk of Troye.
  And of the dedes hath she more enquered
  Of Eneas, and al the story lered                                    (230)
  Of Troye; and al the longe day they tweye
  Entendeden to speken and to pleye;                                   1155
  Of which ther gan to breden swich a fyr,
  That sely Dido hath now swich desyr
  With Eneas, her newe gest, to dele,
  That she hath lost her hewe, and eek her hele.
  Now to theffect, now to the fruit of al,                             1160
  Why I have told this story, and tellen shal.
    Thus I beginne; hit fil, upon a night,
  When that the mone up-reysed had her light,                         (240)
  This noble quene un-to her reste wente;
  She syketh sore, and gan her-self turmente.                          1165
  She waketh, walweth, maketh many a brayd,
  As doon thise loveres, as I have herd sayd.
  And at the laste, unto her suster Anne
  She made her moon, and right thus spak she thanne.
    'Now, dere suster myn, what may hit be                             1170
  That me agasteth in my dreme?' quod she.
  'This ilke Troyan is so in my thoght,
  For that me thinketh he is so wel y-wroght,                         (250)
  And eek so lykly for to be a man,
  And therwithal so mikel good he can,                                 1175
  That al my love and lyf lyth in his cure.
  Have ye not herd him telle his aventure?
  Now certes, Anne, if that ye rede hit me,
  I wolde fain to him y-wedded be;
  This is theffect; what sholde I more seye?                           1180
  In him lyth al, to do me live or deye.'
    Her suster Anne, as she that coude her good,
  Seide as her thoughte, and somdel hit with-stood.                   (260)
  But her-of was so long a sermoning,
  Hit were to long to make rehersing;                                  1185
  But fynally, hit may not been with-stonde;
  Love wol love--for no wight wol hit wonde.
    The dawening up-rist out of the see;
  This amorous quene chargeth her meynee
  The nettes dresse, and speres brode and kene;                        1190
  An hunting wol this lusty fresshe quene;
  So priketh her this newe Ioly wo.
  To hors is al her lusty folk y-go;                                  (270)
  Un-to the court the houndes been y-broght,
  And up-on coursers, swift as any thoght,                             1195
  Her yonge knightes hoven al aboute,
  And of her wommen eek an huge route.
  Up-on a thikke palfrey, paper-whyt,
  With sadel rede, enbrouded with delyt,
  Of gold the barres up-enbossed hye,                                  1200
  Sit Dido, al in gold and perre wrye;
  And she is fair, as is the brighte morwe,
  That heleth seke folk of nightes sorwe.                             (280)
    Up-on a courser, startling as the fyr,
  Men mighte turne him with a litel wyr,                               1205
  Sit Eneas, lyk Phebus to devyse;
  So was he fresshe arayed in his wyse.
  The fomy brydel with the bit of gold
  Governeth he, right as him-self hath wold.
  And forth this noble quene thus lat I ryde                           1210
  An hunting, with this Troyan by her syde.
    The herd of hertes founden is anoon,
  With 'hey! go bet! prik thou! lat goon, lat goon!                   (290)
  Why nil the leoun comen or the bere,
  That I mighte ones mete him with this spere?'                        1215
  Thus seyn thise yonge folk, and up they kille
  These hertes wilde, and han hem at hir wille.
    Among al this to-romblen gan the heven,
  The thunder rored with a grisly steven;
  Doun com the rain, with hail and sleet so faste,                     1220
  With hevenes fyr, that hit so sore agaste
  This noble quene, and also her meynee,
  That ech of hem was glad a-wey to flee.                             (300)
  And shortly, fro the tempest her to save,
  She fledde her-self into a litel cave,                               1225
  And with her wente this Eneas al-so;
  I noot, with hem if ther wente any mo;
  The autour maketh of hit no mencioun.
  And heer began the depe affeccioun
  Betwix hem two; this was the firste morwe                            1230
  Of her gladnesse, and ginning of her sorwe.
  For ther hath Eneas y-kneled so,
  And told her al his herte, and al his wo,                           (310)
  And sworn so depe, to her to be trewe,
  For wele or wo, and chaunge for no newe,                             1235
  And as a fals lover so wel can pleyne,
  That sely Dido rewed on his peyne,
  And took him for husband, [to been] his wyf
  For ever-mo, whyl that hem laste lyf.
  And after this, whan that the tempest stente,                        1240
  With mirth out as they comen, hoom they wente.
    The wikked fame up roos, and that anon,
  How Eneas hath with the quene y-gon                                 (320)
  In-to the cave; and demed as hem liste;
  And whan the king, that Yarbas hight, hit wiste,                     1245
  As he that had her loved ever his lyf,
  And wowed her, to have her to his wyf,
  Swich sorwe as he hath maked, and swich chere,
  Hit is a routhe and pitee for to here.
  But, as in love, al-day hit happeth so,                              1250
  That oon shal laughen at anothers wo;
  Now laugheth Eneas, and is in Ioye
  And more richesse than ever he was in Troye.                        (330)
    O sely womman, ful of innocence,
  Ful of pitee, of trouthe, and conscience,                            1255
  What maked yow to men to trusten so?
  Have ye swich routhe upon hir feined wo,
  And han swich olde ensamples yow beforn?
  See ye nat alle, how they been for-sworn?
  Wher see ye oon, that he ne hath laft his leef,                      1260
  Or been unkinde, or doon her som mischeef,
  Or pilled her, or bosted of his dede?
  Ye may as wel hit seen, as ye may rede;                             (340)
  Tak heed now of this grete gentil-man,
  This Troyan, that so wel her plesen can,                             1265
  That feineth him so trewe and obeising,
  So gentil and so privy of his doing,
  And can so wel doon alle his obeisaunces,
  And waiten her at festes and at daunces,
  And when she goth to temple and hoom ageyn,                          1270
  And fasten til he hath his lady seyn,
  And bere in his devyses, for her sake,
  Noot I nat what; and songes wolde he make,                          (350)
  Iusten, and doon of armes many thinges,
  Sende her lettres, tokens, broches, ringes--                         1275
  Now herkneth, how he shal his lady serve!
  Ther-as he was in peril for to sterve
  For hunger, and for mischeef in the see,
  And desolat, and fled from his contree,
  And al his folk with tempest al to-driven,                           1280
  She hath her body and eek her reame yiven
  In-to his hond, ther-as she mighte have been
  Of other lond than of Cartage a queen,                              (360)
  And lived in Ioye y-nogh; what wolde ye more?
    This Eneas, that hath so depe y-swore,                             1285
  Is wery of his craft with-in a throwe;
  The hote ernest is al over-blowe.
  And prively he doth his shippes dighte,
  And shapeth him to stele a-wey by nighte.
    This Dido hath suspecioun of this,                                 1290
  And thoughte wel, that hit was al a-mis;
  For in his bedde he lyth a-night and syketh;
  She asketh him anoon, what him mislyketh--                          (370)
  'My dere herte, which that I love most?'
    'Certes,' quod he, 'this night my fadres gost                      1295
  Hath in my sleep so sore me tormented,
  And eek Mercurie his message hath presented,
  That nedes to the conquest of Itaile
  My destinee is sone for to saile;
  For which, me thinketh, brosten is myn herte!'                       1300
  Ther-with his false teres out they sterte;
  And taketh her with-in his armes two.
    'Is that in ernest,' quod she; 'wil ye so?                        (380)
  Have ye nat sworn to wyve me to take,
  Alas! what womman wil ye of me make?                                 1305
  I am a gentil-woman and a queen,
  Ye wil nat fro your wyf thus foule fleen?
  That I was born! allas! what shal I do?'
    To telle in short, this noble queen Dido,
  She seketh halwes, and doth sacrifyse;                               1310
  She kneleth, cryeth, that routhe is to devyse;
  Coniureth him, and profreth him to be
  His thral, his servant in the leste gree;                           (390)
  She falleth him to fote, and swowneth there
  Dischevele, with her brighte gilte here,                             1315
  And seith, 'have mercy! let me with yow ryde!
  Thise lordes, which that wonen me besyde
  Wil me destroyen only for your sake.
  And, so ye wil me now to wyve take,
  As ye han sworn, than wol I yive yow leve                            1320
  To sleen me with your swerd now sone at eve!
  For than yit shal I dyen as your wyf.
  I am with childe, and yive my child his lyf.                        (400)
  Mercy, lord! have pite in your thoght!'
  But al this thing availeth her right noght;                          1325
  For on a night, slepinge, he let her lye,
  And stal a-wey un-to his companye,
  And, as a traitour, forth he gan to saile
  Toward the large contree of Itaile.
  Thus hath he laft Dido in wo and pyne;                               1330
  And wedded ther a lady hight Lavyne.
    A cloth he lafte, and eek his swerd stonding,
  Whan he fro Dido stal in her sleping,                               (410)
  Right at her beddes heed, so gan he hye
  Whan that he stal a-wey to his navye;                                1335
  Which cloth, whan sely Dido gan awake,
  She hath hit kist ful ofte for his sake;
  And seide, 'O cloth, whyl Iupiter hit leste,
  Tak now my soule, unbind me of this unreste!
  I have fulfild of fortune al the cours.'                             1340
  And thus, allas! with-outen his socours,
  Twenty tyme y-swowned hath she thanne.
  And, whan that she un-to her suster Anne                            (420)
  Compleyned had, of which I may nat wryte--
  So greet a routhe I have hit for tendyte--                           1345
  And bad her norice and her suster goon
  To fecchen fyr and other thing anoon,
  And seide, that she wolde sacrifye.
  And, whan she mighte her tyme wel espye,
  Up-on the fyr of sacrifys she sterte,                                1350
  And with his swerd she roof her to the herte.
    But, as myn autour seith, right thus she seyde;
  Or she was hurt, before that she deyde,                             (430)
  She wroot a lettre anoon, that thus began:--
    'Right so,' quod she, 'as that the whyte swan                      1355
  Ayeins his deeth beginneth for to singe,
  Right so to yow make I my compleyninge.
  Nat that I trowe to geten yow again,
  For wel I woot that it is al in vain,
  Sin that the goddes been contraire to me.                            1360
  But sin my name is lost through yow,' quod she,
  'I may wel lese a word on yow, or letter,
  Al-be-it that I shal be never the better;                           (440)
  For thilke wind that blew your ship a-wey,
  The same wind hath blowe a-wey your fey.'--                          1365
    But who wol al this letter have in minde,
  Rede Ovide, and in him he shal hit finde.

IV. THE LEGEND OF HYPSIPYLE AND MEDEA.

INCIPIT LEGENDA YSIPHILE ET MEDEE, MARTIRUM.

      PART I. THE LEGEND OF HYPSIPYLE.

  Thou rote of false lovers, duk Iasoun!
  Thou sly devourer and confusioun
  Of gentil-wommen, tender creatures,                                  1370
  Thou madest thy reclaiming and thy lures
  To ladies of thy statly apparaunce,
  And of thy wordes, farced with plesaunce,
  And of thy feyned trouthe and thy manere,
  With thyn obeisaunce and thy humble chere,                           1375
  And with thy counterfeted peyne and wo.
  Ther other falsen oon, thou falsest two!                             (10)
  O! ofte swore thou that thou woldest dye
  For love, whan thou ne feltest maladye
  Save foul delyt, which that thou callest love!                       1380
  If that I live, thy name shal be shove
  In English, that thy sleighte shal be knowe!
  Have at thee, Iasoun! now thyn horn is blowe!
  But certes, hit is bothe routhe and wo
  That love with false loveres werketh so;                             1385
  For they shul have wel better love and chere
  Than he that hath aboght his love ful dere,                          (20)
  Or had in armes many a blody box.
  For ever as tendre a capoun et the fox,
  Thogh he be fals and hath the foul betrayed,                         1390
  As shal the good-man that ther-for hath payed.
  Al have he to the capoun skille and right,
  The false fox wol have his part at night.
  On Iasoun this ensample is wel y-sene
  By Isiphile and Medea the quene.                                     1395
    In Tessalye, as Guido telleth us,
  Ther was a king that highte Pelleus,                                 (30)
  That had a brother, which that highte Eson;
  And, whan for age he mighte unnethes gon,
  He yaf to Pelleus the governing                                      1400
  Of al his regne, and made him lord and king.
  Of which Eson this Iasoun geten was,
  That, in his tyme, in al that lond, ther nas
  Nat swich a famous knight of gentilesse,
  Of freedom, and of strengthe and lustinesse.                         1405
  After his fader deeth, he bar him so
  That ther nas noon that liste been his fo,                           (40)
  But dide him al honour and companye;
  Of which this Pelleus hath greet envye,
  Imagining that Iasoun mighte be                                      1410
  Enhaunsed so, and put in swich degree
  With love of lordes of his regioun,
  That from his regne he may be put adoun.
  And in his wit, a-night, compassed he
  How Iasoun mighte best destroyed be                                  1415
  Withoute slaunder of his compasment.
  And at the laste he took avisement                                   (50)
  To senden him in-to som fer contree
  Ther as this Iasoun may destroyed be.
  This was his wit; al made he to Iasoun                               1420
  Gret chere of love and of affeccioun,
  For drede lest his lordes hit espyde.
  So fil hit so, as fame renneth wyde,
  Ther was swich tyding over-al and swich los,
  That in an yle that called was Colcos,                               1425
  Beyonde Troye, estward in the see,
  That ther-in was a ram, that men mighte see,                         (60)
  That had a flees of gold, that shoon so brighte,
  That no-wher was ther swich an-other sighte;
  But hit was kept alway with a dragoun,                               1430
  And many othere merveils, up and doun,
  And with two boles, maked al of bras,
  That spitten fyr, and moche thing ther was.
  But this was eek the tale, nathelees,
  That who-so wolde winne thilke flees,                                1435
  He moste bothe, or he hit winne mighte,
  With the boles and the dragoun fighte;                               (70)
  And king Oëtes lord was of that yle.
    This Pelleus bethoghte upon this wyle;
  That he his nevew Iasoun wolde enhorte                               1440
  To sailen to that lond, him to disporte,
  And seide, 'Nevew, if hit mighte be
  That swich a worship mighte fallen thee,
  That thou this famous tresor mightest winne,
  And bringen hit my regioun with-inne,                                1445
  Hit were to me gret plesaunce and honour;
  Than were I holde to quyte thy labour.                               (80)
  And al the cost I wol my-selven make;
  And chees what folk that thou wilt with thee take;
  Lat see now, darstow taken this viage?'                              1450
  Iasoun was yong, and lusty of corage,
  And under-took to doon this ilke empryse.
    Anoon Argus his shippes gan devyse;
  With Iasoun wente the stronge Ercules,
  And many an-other that he with him chees.                            1455
  But who-so axeth who is with him gon,
  Lat him go reden Argonauticon,                                       (90)
  For he wol telle a tale long y-now.
  Philotetes anoon the sail up-drow,
  Whan that the wind was good, and gan him hye                         1460
  Out of his contree called Tessalye.
  So long he sailed in the salte see
  Til in the yle Lemnoun aryved he--
  Al be this nat rehersed of Guido,
  Yet seith Ovyde in his Epistles so--                                 1465
  And of this yle lady was and quene
  The faire yonge Isiphilee, the shene,                               (100)
  That whylom Thoas doghter was, the king.
    Isiphilee was goon in her playing;
  And, roming on the clyves by the see,                                1470
  Under a banke anoon espyed she
  Wher that the ship of Iasoun gan aryve.
  Of her goodnesse adoun she sendeth blyve
  To witen yif that any straunge wight
  With tempest thider were y-blowe a-night,                            1475
  To doon him socour; as was her usaunce
  To forthren every wight, and doon plesaunce                         (110)
  Of veray bountee and of curtesye.
    This messagere adoun him gan to hye,
  And fond Iasoun, and Ercules also,                                   1480
  That in a cogge to londe were y-go
  Hem to refresshen and to take the eyr.
  The morwening atempre was and fair;
  And in his wey the messagere hem mette.
  Ful cunningly thise lordes two he grette,                            1485
  And dide his message, axing hem anoon
  Yif they were broken, or oght wo begoon,                            (120)
  Or hadde nede of lodesmen or vitaile;
  For of socour they shulde no-thing faile,
  For hit was utterly the quenes wille.                                1490
    Iasoun answerde, mekely and stille,
  'My lady,' quod he, 'thanke I hertely
  Of hir goodnesse; us nedeth, trewely,
  No-thing as now, but that we wery be,
  And come for to pleye, out of the see,                               1495
  Til that the wind be better in our weye.'
    This lady rometh by the clif to pleye,                            (130)
  With her meynee, endelong the stronde,
  And fynt this Iasoun and this other stonde,
  In spekinge of this thing, as I yow tolde.                           1500
    This Ercules and Iasoun gan beholde
  How that the quene hit was, and faire her grette
  Anon-right as they with this lady mette;
  And she took heed, and knew, by hir manere,
  By hir aray, by wordes and by chere,                                 1505
  That hit were gentil-men, of greet degree.
  And to the castel with her ledeth she                               (140)
  Thise straunge folk, and doth hem greet honour,
  And axeth hem of travail and labour
  That they han suffred in the salte see;                              1510
  So that, within a day, or two, or three,
  She knew, by folk that in his shippes be,
  That hit was Iasoun, ful of renomee,
  And Ercules, that had the grete los,
  That soghten the aventures of Colcos;                                1515
  And dide hem honour more then before,
  And with hem deled ever lenger the more,                            (150)
  For they ben worthy folk, with-outen lees.
  And namely, most she spak with Ercules;
  To him her herte bar, he sholde be                                   1520
  Sad, wys, and trewe, of wordes avisee,
  With-outen any other affeccioun
  Of love, or evil imaginacioun.
    This Ercules hath so this Iasoun preysed,
  That to the sonne he hath him up areysed,                            1525
  That half so trewe a man ther nas of love
  Under the cope of heven that is above;                              (160)
  And he was wys, hardy, secree, and riche.--
  Of thise three pointes ther nas noon him liche;
  Of freedom passed he, and lustihede,                                 1530
  Alle tho that liven or ben dede;
  Ther-to so greet a gentil-man was he,
  And of Tessalie lykly king to be.
  Ther nas no lak, but that he was agast
  To love, and for to speke shamefast.                                 1535
  He hadde lever him-self to mordre, and dye
  Than that men shulde a lover him espye:--                           (170)
  'As wolde almighty god that I had yive
  My blood and flesh, so that I mighte live,
  With the nones that he hadde o-wher a wyf                            1540
  For his estat; for swich a lusty lyf
  She sholde lede with this lusty knight!'
    And al this was compassed on the night
  Betwixe him Iasoun and this Ercules.
  Of thise two heer was mad a shrewed lees                             1545
  To come to hous upon an innocent;
  For to be-dote this queen was hir assent.                           (180)
  And Iasoun is as coy as is a maide,
  He loketh pitously, but noght he saide,
  But frely yaf he to her conseileres                                  1550
  Yiftes grete, and to her officeres.
  As wolde god I leiser hadde, and tyme,
  By proces al his wowing for to ryme.
  But in this hous if any fals lover be,
  Right as him-self now doth, right so dide he,                        1555
  With feyning and with every sotil dede.
  Ye gete no more of me, but ye wil rede                              (190)
  Thoriginal, that telleth al the cas.
    The somme is this, that Iasoun wedded was
  Unto this quene, and took of her substaunce                          1560
  What-so him liste, unto his purveyaunce;
  And upon her begat he children two,
  And drow his sail, and saw her never-mo.
    A lettre sente she to him certein,
  Which were to long to wryten and to sein,                            1565
  And him repreveth of his grete untrouthe,
  And preyeth him on her to have som routhe.                          (200)
  And of his children two, she seide him this,
  That they be lyke, of alle thing, y-wis,
  To Iasoun, save they coude nat begyle;                               1570
  And preyed god, or hit were longe whyle,
  That she, that had his herte y-raft her fro,
  Moste finden him to her untrewe al-so,
  And that she moste bothe her children spille,
  And alle tho that suffreth him his wille.                            1575
  And trew to Iasoun was she al her lyf,
  And ever kepte her chast, as for his wyf;                           (210)
  Ne never had she Ioye at her herte,
  But dyed, for his love, of sorwes smerte.

      PART II. THE LEGEND OF MEDEA.

    To Colcos comen is this duk Iasoun,                                1580
  That is of love devourer and dragoun.
  As matere appetyteth forme al-wey,
  And from forme in-to forme hit passen may,
  Or as a welle that were botomlees,
  Right so can fals Iasoun have no pees.                               1585
  For, to desyren, through his appetyt,
  To doon with gentil wommen his delyt,                               (220)
  This is his lust and his felicitee.
    Iasoun is romed forth to the citee,
  That whylom cleped was Iaconitos,                                    1590
  That was the maister-toun of al Colcos,
  And hath y-told the cause of his coming
  Un-to Oëtes, of that contre king,
  Preying him that he moste doon his assay
  To gete the flees of gold, if that he may;                           1595
  Of which the king assenteth to his bone,
  And doth him honour, as hit is to done,                             (230)
  So ferforth, that his doghter and his eyr,
  Medea, which that was so wys and fair
  That fairer saw ther never man with yë,                              1600
  He made her doon to Iasoun companye
  At mete, and sitte by him in the halle.
    Now was Iasoun a semely man with-alle,
  And lyk a lord, and had a greet renoun,
  And of his loke as real as leoun,                                    1605
  And goodly of his speche, and famulere,
  And coude of love al craft and art plenere                          (240)
  With-oute boke, with everich observaunce.
  And, as fortune her oghte a foul meschaunce,
  She wex enamoured upon this man.                                     1610
    'Iasoun,' quod she, 'for ought I see or can,
  As of this thing the which ye been aboute,
  Ye han your-self y-put in moche doute.
  For, who-so wol this aventure acheve,
  He may nat wel asterten, as I leve,                                  1615
  With-outen deeth, but I his helpe be.
  But natheles, hit is my wille,' quod she,                           (250)
  'To forthren yow, so that ye shal nat dye,
  But turnen, sound, hoom to your Tessalye.'
    'My righte lady,' quod this Iasoun tho,                            1620
  'That ye han of my dethe or of my wo
  Any reward, and doon me this honour,
  I wot wel that my might ne my labour
  May nat deserve hit in my lyves day;
  God thanke yow, ther I ne can ne may.                                1625
  Your man am I, and lowly you beseche,
  To been my help, with-oute more speche;                             (260)
  But certes, for my deeth shal I nat spare.'
    Tho gan this Medea to him declare
  The peril of this cas, fro point to point,                           1630
  And of his batail, and in what disioint
  He mote stande, of which no creature,
  Save only she, ne mighte his lyf assure.
  And shortly, to the point right for to go,
  They been accorded ful, betwix hem two,                              1635
  That Iasoun shal her wedde, as trewe knight;
  And term y-set, to come sone at night                               (270)
  Unto her chambre, and make ther his ooth,
  Upon the goddes, that he, for leef ne looth,
  Ne sholde her never falsen, night ne day,                            1640
  To been her husbond, whyl he liven may,
  As she that from his deeth him saved here.
  And her-upon, at night they mette y-fere,
  And doth his ooth, and goth with her to bedde.
  And on the morwe, upward he him spedde;                              1645
  For she hath taught him how he shal nat faile
  The flees to winne, and stinten his bataile;                        (280)
  And saved him his lyf and his honour;
  And gat him greet name as a conquerour
  Right through the sleight of her enchantement.                       1650
    Now hath Iasoun the flees, and hoom is went
  With Medea, and tresor ful gret woon.
  But unwist of her fader is she goon
  To Tessaly, with duk Iasoun her leef,
  That afterward hath broght her to mescheef.                          1655
  For as a traitour he is from her go,
  And with her lafte his yonge children two,                          (290)
  And falsly hath betrayed her, allas!
  And ever in love a cheef traitour he was;
  And wedded yit the thridde wyf anon,                                 1660
  That was the doghter of the king Creon.
    This is the meed of loving and guerdon
  That Medea received of Iasoun
  Right for her trouthe and for her kindenesse,
  That loved him better than her-self, I gesse,                        1665
  And lafte her fader and her heritage.
  And of Iasoun this is the vassalage,                                (300)
  That, in his dayes, nas ther noon y-founde
  So fals a lover going on the grounde.
  And therfor in her lettre thus she seyde                             1670
  First, whan she of his falsnesse him umbreyde,
  'Why lyked me thy yelow heer to see
  More then the boundes of myn honestee,
  Why lyked me thy youthe and thy fairnesse,
  And of thy tonge the infinit graciousnesse?                          1675
  O, haddest thou in thy conquest deed y-be,
  Ful mikel untrouthe had ther dyed with thee!'                       (310)
    Wel can Ovyde her lettre in vers endyte,
  Which were as now to long for me to wryte.

V. THE LEGEND OF LUCRETIA.

INCIPIT LEGENDA LUCRECIE ROME, MARTIRIS.

  Now moot I seyn the exiling of kinges                                1680
  Of Rome, for hir horrible doinges,
  And of the laste king Tarquinius,
  As saith Ovyde and Titus Livius.
  But for that cause telle I nat this storie,
  But for to preise and drawen to memorie                              1685
  The verray wyf, the verray trewe Lucresse,
  That, for her wyfhood and her stedfastnesse,
  Nat only that thise payens her comende,
  But he, that cleped is in our legende                                (10)
  The grete Austin, hath greet compassioun                             1690
  Of this Lucresse, that starf at Rome toun;
  And in what wyse, I wol but shortly trete,
  And of this thing I touche but the grete.
    Whan Ardea beseged was aboute
  With Romains, that ful sterne were and stoute,                       1695
  Ful longe lay the sege, and litel wroghte,
  So that they were half ydel, as hem thoghte;
  And in his pley Tarquinius the yonge
  Gan for to iape, for he was light of tonge,                          (20)
  And seyde, that 'it was an ydel lyf;                                 1700
  No man did ther no more than his wyf;
  And lat us speke of wyves, that is best;
  Praise every man his owne, as him lest,
  And with our speche lat us ese our herte.'
    A knight, that highte Colatyne, up sterte,                         1705
  And seyde thus, 'nay, for hit is no nede
  To trowen on the word, but on the dede.
  I have a wyf,' quod he, 'that, as I trowe,
  Is holden good of alle that ever her knowe;                          (30)
  Go we to-night to Rome, and we shul see.'                            1710
    Tarquinius answerde, 'that lyketh me.'
  To Rome be they come, and faste hem dighte
  To Colatynes hous, and doun they lighte,
  Tarquinius, and eek this Colatyne.
  The husbond knew the estres wel and fyne,                            1715
  And prively into the hous they goon;
  Nor at the gate porter was ther noon;
  And at the chambre-dore they abyde.
  This noble wyf sat by her beddes syde                                (40)
  Dischevele, for no malice she ne thoghte;                            1720
  And softe wolle our book seith that she wroghte
  To kepen her fro slouthe and ydelnesse;
  And bad her servants doon hir businesse,
  And axeth hem, 'what tydings heren ye?
  How seith men of the sege, how shal hit be?                          1725
  God wolde the walles weren falle adoun;
  Myn husbond is so longe out of this toun,
  For which the dreed doth me so sore smerte,
  Right as a swerd hit stingeth to myn herte                           (50)
  Whan I think on the sege or of that place;                           1730
  God save my lord, I preye him for his grace:'--
  And ther-with-al ful tenderly she weep,
  And of her werk she took no more keep,
  But mekely she leet her eyen falle;
  And thilke semblant sat her wel with-alle.                           1735
  And eek her teres, ful of honestee,
  Embelisshed her wyfly chastitee;
  Her countenaunce is to her herte digne,
  For they acordeden in dede and signe.                                (60)
  And with that word her husbond Colatyn,                              1740
  Or she of him was war, com sterting in,
  And seide, 'dreed thee noght, for I am here!'
  And she anoon up roos, with blisful chere,
  And kiste him, as of wyves is the wone.
    Tarquinius, this proude kinges sone,                               1745
  Conceived hath her beautee and her chere,
  Her yelow heer, her shap, and her manere,
  Her hew, her wordes that she hath compleyned,
  And by no crafte her beautee nas nat feyned;                         (70)
  And caughte to this lady swich desyr,                                1750
  That in his herte brende as any fyr
  So woodly, that his wit was al forgeten.
  For wel, thoghte he, she sholde nat be geten
  And ay the more that he was in dispair,
  The more he coveteth and thoghte her fair.                           1755
  His blinde lust was al his covetinge.
    A-morwe, whan the brid began to singe,
  Unto the sege he comth ful privily,
  And by himself he walketh sobrely,                                   (80)
  Thimage of her recording alwey newe;                                 1760
  'Thus lay her heer, and thus fresh was her hewe;
  Thus sat, thus spak, thus span; this was her chere,
  Thus fair she was, and this was her manere.'
  Al this conceit his herte hath now y-take.
  And, as the see, with tempest al to-shake,                           1765
  That, after whan the storm is al ago,
  Yet wol the water quappe a day or two,
  Right so, thogh that her forme wer absent,
  The plesaunce of her forme was present;                              (90)
  But natheles, nat plesaunce, but delyt,                              1770
  Or an unrightful talent with despyt;
  'For, maugre her, she shal my lemman be;
  Hap helpeth hardy man alday,' quod he;
  'What ende that I make, hit shal be so;'
  And girt him with his swerde, and gan to go;                         1775
  And forth he rit til he to Rome is come,
  And al aloon his wey than hath he nome
  Unto the house of Colatyn ful right.
  Doun was the sonne, and day hath lost his light;                    (100)
  And in he com un-to a privy halke,                                   1780
  And in the night ful theefly gan he stalke,
  Whan every night was to his reste broght,
  Ne no wight had of tresoun swich a thoght.
  Were hit by window or by other gin,
  With swerde y-drawe, shortly he comth in                             1785
  Ther as she lay, this noble wyf Lucresse.
  And, as she wook, her bed she felte presse.
  'What beste is that,' quod she, 'that weyeth thus?'
  'I am the kinges sone, Tarquinius,'                                 (110)
  Quod he, 'but and thou crye, or noise make,                          1790
  Or if thou any creature awake,
  By thilke god that formed man on lyve,
  This swerd through-out thyn herte shal I ryve.'
  And ther-withal unto her throte he sterte,
  And sette the point al sharp upon her herte.                         1795
  No word she spak, she hath no might therto.
  What shal she sayn? her wit is al ago.
  Right as a wolf that fynt a lomb aloon,
  To whom shal she compleyne, or make moon?                           (120)
  What! shal she fighte with an hardy knight?                          1800
  Wel wot men that a woman hath no might.
  What! shal she crye, or how shal she asterte
  That hath her by the throte, with swerde at herte?
  She axeth grace, and seith al that she can.
  'Ne wolt thou nat,' quod he, this cruel man,                         1805
  'As wisly Iupiter my soule save,
  As I shal in the stable slee thy knave,
  And leye him in thy bed, and loude crye,
  That I thee finde in suche avouterye;                               (130)
  And thus thou shalt be deed, and also lese                           1810
  Thy name, for thou shalt non other chese.'
    Thise Romain wyves loveden so hir name
  At thilke tyme, and dredden so the shame,
  That, what for fere of slaundre and drede of deeth,
  She loste bothe at-ones wit and breeth,                              1815
  And in a swough she lay and wex so deed,
  Men mighte smyten of her arm or heed;
  She feleth no-thing, neither foul ne fair.
    Tarquinius, that art a kinges eyr,                                (140)
  And sholdest, as by linage and by right,                             1820
  Doon as a lord and as a verray knight,
  Why hastow doon dispyt to chivalrye?
  Why hastow doon this lady vilanye?
  Allas! of thee this was a vileins dede!
    But now to purpos; in the story I rede,                            1825
  Whan he was goon, al this mischaunce is falle.
  This lady sente after her frendes alle,
  Fader, moder, husbond, al y-fere;
  And al dischevele, with her heres clere,                            (150)
  In habit swich as women used tho                                     1830
  Unto the burying of her frendes go,
  She sit in halle with a sorweful sighte.
  Her frendes axen what her aylen mighte,
  And who was deed? And she sit ay wepinge,
  A word for shame ne may she forth out-bringe,                        1835
  Ne upon hem she dorste nat beholde.
  But atte laste of Tarquiny she hem tolde,
  This rewful cas, and al this thing horrible.
  The wo to tellen hit were impossible,                               (160)
  That she and alle her frendes made atones.                           1840
  Al hadde folkes hertes been of stones,
  Hit mighte have maked hem upon her rewe,
  Her herte was so wyfly and so trewe.
  She seide, that, for her gilt ne for her blame,
  Her husbond sholde nat have the foule name,                          1845
  That wolde she nat suffre, by no wey.
  And they answerden alle, upon hir fey,
  That they foryeve hit her, for hit was right;
  Hit was no gilt, hit lay nat in her might;                          (170)
  And seiden her ensamples many oon.                                   1850
  But al for noght; for thus she seide anoon,
  'Be as be may,' quod she, 'of forgiving,
  I wol nat have no forgift for no-thing.'
  But prively she caughte forth a knyf,
  And therwith-al she rafte her-self her lyf;                          1855
  And as she fel adoun, she caste her look,
  And of her clothes yit she hede took;
  For in her falling yit she hadde care
  Lest that her feet or swiche thing lay bare;                        (180)
  So wel she loved clennesse and eek trouthe.                          1860
    Of her had al the toun of Rome routhe,
  And Brutus by her chaste blode hath swore
  That Tarquin sholde y-banisht be ther-fore,
  And al his kin; and let the peple calle,
  And openly the tale he tolde hem alle,                               1865
  And openly let carie her on a bere
  Through al the toun, that men may see and here
  The horrible deed of her oppressioun.
  Ne never was ther king in Rome toun                                 (190)
  Sin thilke day; and she was holden there                             1870
  A seint, and ever her day y-halwed dere
  As in hir lawe: and thus endeth Lucresse,
  The noble wyf, as Titus bereth witnesse.
    I tell hit, for she was of love so trewe,
  Ne in her wille she chaunged for no newe.                            1875
  And for the stable herte, sad and kinde,
  That in these women men may alday finde;
  Ther as they caste hir herte, ther hit dwelleth.
  For wel I wot, that Crist him-selve telleth,                        (200)
  That in Israel, as wyd as is the lond,                               1880
  That so gret feith in al the lond he ne fond
  As in a woman; and this is no lye.
  And as of men, loketh which tirannye
  They doon alday; assay hem who so liste,
  The trewest is ful brotel for to triste.                             1885

VI. THE LEGEND OF ARIADNE.

INCIPIT LEGENDA ADRIANE DE ATHENES.

  Iuge infernal, Minos, of Crete king,
  Now cometh thy lot, now comestow on the ring;
  Nat for thy sake only wryte I this storie,
  But for to clepe agein unto memorie
  Of Theseus the grete untrouthe of love;                              1890
  For which the goddes of the heven above
  Ben wrothe, and wreche han take for thy sinne.
  Be reed for shame! now I thy lyf beginne.
    Minos, that was the mighty king of Crete,
  That hadde an hundred citees stronge and grete,                      1895
  To scole hath sent his sone Androgeus,                               (11)
  To Athenes; of the whiche hit happed thus,
  That he was slayn, lerning philosophye,
  Right in that citee, nat but for envye.
    The grete Minos, of the whiche I speke,                            1900
  His sones deeth is comen for to wreke;
  Alcathoe he bisegeth harde and longe.
  But natheles the walles be so stronge,
  And Nisus, that was king of that citee,
  So chivalrous, that litel dredeth he;                                1905
  Of Minos or his ost took he no cure,                                 (21)
  Til on a day befel an aventure,
  That Nisus doghter stood upon the wal,
  And of the sege saw the maner al.
  So happed hit, that, at a scarmishing,                               1910
  She caste her herte upon Minos the king,
  For his beautee and for his chivalrye,
  So sore, that she wende for to dye.
  And, shortly of this proces for to pace,
  She made Minos winnen thilke place,                                  1915
  So that the citee was al at his wille,                               (31)
  To saven whom him list, or elles spille;
  But wikkedly he quitte her kindenesse,
  And let her drenche in sorowe and distresse,
  Nere that the goddes hadde of her pite;                              1920
  But that tale were to long as now for me.
    Athenes wan this king Minos also,
  And Alcathoe and other tounes mo;
  And this theffect, that Minos hath so driven
  Hem of Athenes, that they mote him yiven                             1925
  Fro yere to yere her owne children dere                              (41)
  For to be slayn, as ye shul after here.
    This Minos hath a monstre, a wikked beste,
  That was so cruel that, without areste,
  Whan that a man was broght in his presence,                          1930
  He wolde him ete, ther helpeth no defence.
  And every thridde yeer, with-outen doute,
  They casten lot, and, as hit com aboute
  On riche, on pore, he moste his sone take,
  And of his child he moste present make                               1935
  Unto Minos, to save him or to spille,                                (51)
  Or lete his beste devoure him at his wille.
  And this hath Minos don, right in despyt;
  To wreke his sone was set al his delyt,
  And maken hem of Athenes his thral                                   1940
  Fro yere to yere, whyl that he liven shal;
  And hoom he saileth whan this toun is wonne.
  This wikked custom is so longe y-ronne
  Til that of Athenes king Egeus
  Mot sende his owne sone, Theseus,                                    1945
  Sith that the lot is fallen him upon,                                (61)
  To be devoured, for grace is ther non.
  And forth is lad this woful yonge knight
  Unto the court of king Minos ful right,
  And in a prison, fetered, cast is he                                 1950
  Til thilke tyme he sholde y-freten be.
    Wel maystow wepe, O woful Theseus,
  That art a kinges sone, and dampned thus.
  Me thinketh this, that thou were depe y-holde
  To whom that saved thee fro cares colde!                             1955
  And now, if any woman helpe thee,                                    (71)
  Wel oughtestow her servant for to be,
  And been her trewe lover yeer by yere!
  But now to come ageyn to my matere.
    The tour, ther as this Theseus is throwe                           1960
  Doun in the botom derke and wonder lowe,
  Was ioyning in the walle to a foreyne;
  And hit was longing to the doghtren tweyne
  Of king Minos, that in hir chambres grete
  Dwelten above, toward the maister-strete,                            1965
  In mochel mirthe, in Ioye and in solas.                              (81)
  Not I nat how, hit happed ther, per cas,
  As Theseus compleyned him by nighte,
  The kinges doghter, Adrian that highte,
  And eek her suster Phedra, herden al                                 1970
  His compleyning, as they stode on the wal
  And lokeden upon the brighte mone;
  Hem leste nat to go to bedde sone.
  And of his wo they had compassioun;
  A kinges sone to ben in swich prisoun                                1975
  And be devoured, thoughte hem gret pitee.                            (91)
    Than Adrian spak to her suster free,
  And seyde, 'Phedra, leve suster dere,
  This woful lordes sone may ye nat here,
  How pitously compleyneth he his kin,                                 1980
  And eek his pore estat that he is in,
  And gilteless? now certes, hit is routhe!
  And if ye wol assenten, by my trouthe,
  He shal be holpen, how so that we do!'
    Phedra answerde, 'y-wis, me is as wo                               1985
  For him as ever I was for any man;                                  (101)
  And, to his help, the beste reed I can
  Is that we doon the gayler prively
  To come, and speke with us hastily,
  And doon this woful man with him to come.                            1990
  For if he may this monstre overcome,
  Than were he quit; ther is noon other bote.
  Lat us wel taste him at his herte-rote,
  That, if so be that he a wepen have,
  Wher that he dar, his lyf to kepe and save,                          1995
  Fighten with this fend, and him defende.                            (111)
  For, in the prison, ther he shal descende,
  Ye wite wel, that the beste is in a place
  That nis nat derk, and hath roum eek and space
  To welde an ax or swerd or staf or knyf,                             2000
  So that, me thinketh, he sholde save his lyf;
  If that he be a man, he shal do so.
  And we shul make him balles eek also
  Of wexe and towe, that, whan he gapeth faste,
  Into the bestes throte he shal hem caste                             2005
  To slake his hunger and encombre his teeth;                         (121)
  And right anon, whan that Theseus seeth
  The beste achoked, he shal on him lepe
  To sleen him, or they comen more to-hepe.
  This wepen shal the gayler, or that tyde,                            2010
  Ful privily within the prison hyde;
  And, for the hous is crinkled to and fro,
  And hath so queinte weyes for to go--
  For hit is shapen as the mase is wroght--
  Therto have I a remedie in my thoght,                                2015
  That, by a clewe of twyne, as he hath goon,                         (131)
  The same wey he may returne anoon,
  Folwing alwey the threed, as he hath come.
  And, whan that he this beste hath overcome,
  Then may he fleen awey out of this drede,                            2020
  And eek the gayler may he with him lede,
  And him avaunce at hoom in his contree,
  Sin that so greet a lordes sone is he.
  This is my reed, if that he dar hit take.'
    What sholde I lenger sermoun of hit make?                          2025
  The gayler cometh, and with him Theseus.                            (141)
  And whan thise thinges been acorded thus,
  Adoun sit Theseus upon his knee:--
  'The righte lady of my lyf,' quod he,
  'I, sorweful man, y-dampned to the deeth,                            2030
  Fro yow, whyl that me lasteth lyf or breeth,
  I wol nat twinne, after this aventure,
  But in your servise thus I wol endure,
  That, as a wrecche unknowe, I wol yow serve
  For ever-mo, til that myn herte sterve.                              2035
  Forsake I wol at hoom myn heritage,                                 (151)
  And, as I seide, ben of your court a page,
  If that ye vouche-sauf that, in this place,
  Ye graunte me to han so gret a grace
  That I may han nat but my mete and drinke;                           2040
  And for my sustenance yit wol I swinke,
  Right as yow list, that Minos ne no wight--
  Sin that he saw me never with eyen sight--
  Ne no man elles, shal me conne espye;
  So slyly and so wel I shal me gye,                                   2045
  And me so wel disfigure and so lowe,                                (161)
  That in this world ther shal no man me knowe,
  To han my lyf, and for to han presence
  Of yow, that doon to me this excellence.
  And to my fader shal I senden here                                   2050
  This worthy man, that is now your gaylere,
  And, him to guerdon, that he shal wel be
  Oon of the grettest men of my contree.
  And yif I dorste seyn, my lady bright,
  I am a kinges sone, and eek a knight;                                2055
  As wolde god, yif that hit mighte be                                (171)
  Ye weren in my contree, alle three,
  And I with yow, to bere yow companye,
  Than shulde ye seen yif that I ther-of lye!
  And, if I profre yow in low manere                                   2060
  To ben your page and serven yow right here,
  But I yow serve as lowly in that place,
  I prey to Mars to yive me swiche a grace
  That shames deeth on me ther mote falle,
  And deeth and povert to my frendes alle;                             2065
  And that my spirit by nighte mote go                                (181)
  After my deeth, and walke to and fro;
  That I mote of a traitour have a name,
  For which my spirit go, to do me shame!
  And yif I ever claime other degree,                                  2070
  But-if ye vouche-sauf to yive hit me,
  As I have seid, of shames deeth I deye!
  And mercy, lady! I can nat elles seye!'
    A seemly knight was Theseus to see,
  And yong, but of a twenty yeer and three;                            2075
  But who-so hadde y-seyn his countenaunce,                           (191)
  He wolde have wept, for routhe of his penaunce;
  For which this Adriane in this manere
  Answerde to his profre and to his chere.
    'A kinges sone, and eek a knight,' quod she,                       2080
  'To been my servant in so low degree,
  God shilde hit, for the shame of women alle!
  And leve me never swich a cas befalle!
  But sende yow grace and sleighte of herte also,
  Yow to defende and knightly sleen your fo,                           2085
  And leve herafter that I may yow finde                              (201)
  To me and to my suster here so kinde,
  That I repente nat to give yow lyf!
  Yit were hit better that I were your wyf,
  Sin that ye been as gentil born as I,                                2090
  And have a rëaume, nat but faste by,
  Then that I suffred giltles yow to sterve,
  Or that I let yow as a page serve;
  Hit is not profit, as unto your kinrede;
  But what is that that man nil do for drede?                          2095
  And to my suster, sin that hit is so                                (211)
  That she mot goon with me, if that I go,
  Or elles suffre deeth as wel as I,
  That ye unto your sone as trewely
  Doon her be wedded at your hoom-coming.                              2100
  This is the fynal ende of al this thing;
  Ye swere hit heer, on al that may be sworn.'
    'Ye, lady myn,' quod he, 'or elles torn
  Mote I be with the Minotaur to-morwe!
  And haveth her-of my herte-blood to borwe,                           2105
  Yif that ye wile; if I had knyf or spere,                           (221)
  I wolde hit leten out, and ther-on swere,
  For than at erst I wot ye wil me leve.
  By Mars, that is the cheef of my bileve,
  So that I mighte liven and nat faile                                 2110
  To-morwe for tacheve my bataile,
  I nolde never fro this place flee,
  Til that ye shuld the verray preve see.
  For now, if that the sooth I shal yow say,
  I have y-loved yow ful many a day,                                   2115
  Thogh ye ne wiste hit nat, in my contree.                           (231)
  And aldermost desyred yow to see
  Of any erthly living creature;
  Upon my trouthe I swere, and yow assure,
  Thise seven yeer I have your servant be;                             2120
  Now have I yow, and also have ye me,
  My dere herte, of Athenes duchesse!'
    This lady smyleth at his stedfastnesse,
  And at his hertly wordes, and his chere,
  And to her suster seide in this manere,                              2125
  Al softely, 'now, suster myn,' quod she,                            (241)
  'Now be we duchesses, bothe I and ye,
  And sikered to the regals of Athenes,
  And bothe her-after lykly to be quenes,
  And saved fro his deeth a kinges sone,                               2130
  As ever of gentil women is the wone
  To save a gentil man, emforth hir might,
  In honest cause, and namely in his right.
  Me thinketh no wight oghte her-of us blame,
  Ne beren us ther-for an evel name.'                                  2135
    And shortly of this matere for to make,                           (251)
  This Theseus of her hath leve y-take,
  And every point performed was in dede
  As ye have in this covenant herd me rede.
  His wepen, his clew, his thing that I have said,                     2140
  Was by the gayler in the hous y-laid
  Ther as this Minotaur hath his dwelling,
  Right faste by the dore, at his entring.
  And Theseus is lad unto his deeth,
  And forth un-to this Minotaur he geeth,                              2145
  And by the teching of this Adriane                                  (261)
  He overcom this beste, and was his bane;
  And out he cometh by the clewe again
  Ful prevely, whan he this beste hath slain;
  And by the gayler geten hath a barge,                                2150
  And of his wyves tresor gan hit charge,
  And took his wyf, and eek her suster free,
  And eek the gayler, and with hem alle three
  Is stole awey out of the lond by nighte,
  And to the contre of Ennopye him dighte                              2155
  Ther as he had a frend of his knowinge.                             (271)
  Ther festen they, ther dauncen they and singe;
  And in his armes hath this Adriane,
  That of the beste hath kept him from his bane;
  And gat him ther a newe barge anoon,                                 2160
  And of his contree-folk a ful gret woon,
  And taketh his leve, and hoomward saileth he.
  And in an yle, amid the wilde see,
  Ther as ther dwelte creature noon
  Save wilde bestes, and that ful many oon,                            2165
  He made his ship a-londe for to sette;                              (281)
  And in that yle half a day he lette,
  And seide, that on the lond he moste him reste.
  His mariners han doon right as him leste;
  And, for to tellen shortly in this cas,                              2170
  Whan Adriane his wyf a-slepe was,
  For that her suster fairer was than she,
  He taketh her in his hond, and forth goth he
  To shippe, and as a traitour stal his way
  Whyl that this Adriane a-slepe lay,                                  2175
  And to his contree-ward he saileth blyve--                          (291)
  A twenty devil way the wind him dryve!--
  And fond his fader drenched in the see.
    Me list no more to speke of him, parde;
  Thise false lovers, poison be hir bane!                              2180
  But I wol turne again to Adriane
  That is with slepe for werinesse atake.
  Ful sorwefully her herte may awake.
  Allas! for thee my herte hath now pite!
  Right in the dawening awaketh she,                                   2185
  And gropeth in the bedde, and fond right noght.                     (307)
  'Allas!' quod she, 'that ever I was wroght!
  I am betrayed!' and her heer to-rente,
  And to the stronde bar-fot faste she wente,
  And cryed, 'Theseus! myn herte swete!                                2190
  Wher be ye, that I may nat with yow mete,
  And mighte thus with bestes been y-slain?'
    The holwe rokkes answerde her again;
  No man she saw, and yit shyned the mone,
  And hye upon a rokke she wente sone,                                 2195
  And saw his barge sailing in the see.                               (311)
  Cold wex her herte, and right thus seide she.
  'Meker than ye finde I the bestes wilde!'
  Hadde he nat sinne, that her thus begylde?
  She cryed, 'O turne again, for routhe and sinne!                     2200
  Thy barge hath nat al his meiny inne!'
  Her kerchef on a pole up stikked she,
  Ascaunce that he sholde hit wel y-see,
  And him remembre that she was behinde,
  And turne again, and on the stronde her finde;                       2205
  But al for noght; his wey he is y-goon.                             (321)
  And doun she fil a-swown upon a stoon;
  And up she rist, and kiste, in al her care,
  The steppes of his feet, ther he hath fare,
  And to her bedde right thus she speketh tho:--                       2210
  'Thou bed,' quod she, 'that hast receyved two,
  Thou shalt answere of two, and nat of oon!
  Wher is thy gretter part away y-goon?
  Allas! wher shal I, wrecched wight, become!
  For, thogh so be that ship or boot heer come,                        2215
  Hoom to my contree dar I nat for drede;                             (331)
  I can my-selven in this cas nat rede!'
    What shal I telle more her compleining?
  Hit is so long, hit were an hevy thing.
  In her epistle Naso telleth al;                                      2220
  But shortly to the ende I telle shal.
  The goddes have her holpen, for pitee;
  And, in the signe of Taurus, men may see
  The stones of her coroun shyne clere.--
    I wol no more speke of this matere;                                2225
  But thus this false lover can begyle                                (341)
  His trewe love. The devil quyte him his whyle!

VII. THE LEGEND OF PHILOMELA.

INCIPIT LEGENDA PHILOMENE.

      _Deus dator formarum._

  Thou yiver of the formes, that hast wroght
  The faire world, and bare hit in thy thoght
  Eternally, or thou thy werk began,                                   2230
  Why madest thou, unto the slaundre of man,
  Or--al be that hit was not thy doing,
  As for that fyn to make swiche a thing--
  Why suffrest thou that Tereus was bore,
  That is in love so fals and so forswore,                             2235
  That, fro this world up to the firste hevene,
  Corrumpeth, whan that folk his name nevene?                          (10)
  And, as to me, so grisly was his dede,
  That, whan that I his foule story rede,
  Myn eyen wexen foule and sore also;                                  2240
  Yit last the venim of so longe ago,
  That hit enfecteth him that wol beholde
  The story of Tereus, of which I tolde.
    Of Trace was he lord, and kin to Marte,
  The cruel god that stant with blody darte;                           2245
  And wedded had he, with a blisful chere,
  King Pandiones faire doghter dere,                                   (20)
  That highte Progne, flour of her contree,
  Thogh Iuno list nat at the feste be,
  Ne Ymeneus, that god of wedding is;                                  2250
  But at the feste redy been, y-wis,
  The furies three, with alle hir mortel brond.
  The owle al night aboute the balkes wond,
  That prophet is of wo and of mischaunce.
  This revel, ful of songe and ful of daunce,                          2255
  Lasteth a fourtenight, or litel lasse.
  But, shortly of this story for to passe,                             (30)
  For I am wery of him for to telle,
  Five yeer his wyf and he togeder dwelle,
  Til on a day she gan so sore longe                                   2260
  To seen her suster, that she saw nat longe,
  That for desyr she niste what to seye.
  But to her husband gan she for to preye,
  For goddes love, that she moste ones goon
  Her suster for to seen, and come anoon,                              2265
  Or elles, but she moste to her wende,
  She preyde him, that he wolde after her sende;                       (40)
  And this was, day by day, al her prayere
  With al humblesse of wyfhood, word, and chere.
    This Tereus let make his shippes yare,                             2270
  And into Grece him-self is forth y-fare
  Unto his fader in lawe, and gan him preye
  To vouche-sauf that, for a month or tweye,
  That Philomene, his wyves suster, mighte
  On Progne his wyf but ones have a sighte--                           2275
  'And she shal come to yow again anoon.
  Myself with her wol bothe come and goon,                             (50)
  And as myn hertes lyf I wol her kepe.'
    This olde Pandion, this king, gan wepe
  For tendernesse of herte, for to leve                                2280
  His doghter goon, and for to yive her leve;
  Of al this world he lovede no-thing so;
  But at the laste leve hath she to go.
  For Philomene, with salte teres eke,
  Gan of her fader grace to beseke                                     2285
  To seen her suster, that her longeth so;
  And him embraceth with her armes two.                                (60)
  And therwith-al so yong and fair was she
  That, whan that Terëus saw her beautee,
  And of array that ther was noon her liche,                           2290
  And yit of bountee was she two so riche,
  He caste his fyry herte upon her so
  That he wol have her, how so that hit go,
  And with his wyles kneled and so preyde,
  Til at the laste Pandion thus seyde:--                               2295
    'Now, sone,' quod he, 'that art to me so dere,
  I thee betake my yonge doghter here,                                 (70)
  That bereth the key of al my hertes lyf.
  And grete wel my doghter and thy wyf,
  And yive her leve somtyme for to pleye,                              2300
  That she may seen me ones er I deye.'
  And soothly, he hath mad him riche feste,
  And to his folk, the moste and eek the leste,
  That with him com; and yaf him yiftes grete,
  And him conveyeth through the maister-strete                         2305
  Of Athenes, and to the see him broghte,
  And turneth hoom; no malice he ne thoghte.                           (80)
    The ores pulleth forth the vessel faste,
  And into Trace arriveth at the laste,
  And up into a forest he her ledde,                                   2310
  And to a cave privily him spedde;
  And, in this derke cave, yif her leste,
  Or leste noght, he bad her for to reste;
  Of whiche her herte agroos, and seyde thus,
  'Wher is my suster, brother Tereus?'                                 2315
  And therwith-al she wepte tenderly,
  And quook for fere, pale and pitously,                               (90)
  Right as the lamb that of the wolf is biten;
  Or as the colver, that of the egle is smiten,
  And is out of his clawes forth escaped,                              2320
  Yet hit is afered and awhaped
  Lest hit be hent eft-sones, so sat she.
  But utterly hit may non other be.
  By force hath he, this traitour, doon that dede,
  That he hath reft her of her maydenhede,                             2325
  Maugree her heed, by strengthe and by his might.
  Lo! here a dede of men, and that a right!                           (100)
  She cryeth 'suster!' with ful loude stevene,
  And 'fader dere!' and 'help me, god in hevene!'
  Al helpeth nat; and yet this false theef                             2330
  Hath doon this lady yet a more mischeef,
  For fere lest she sholde his shame crye,
  And doon him openly a vilanye,
  And with his swerd her tong of kerveth he,
  And in a castel made her for to be                                   2335
  Ful privily in prison evermore,
  And kepte her to his usage and his store,                           (110)
  So that she mighte him nevermore asterte.
  O sely Philomene! wo is thyn herte;
  God wreke thee, and sende thee thy bone!                             2340
  Now is hit tyme I make an ende sone.
    This Tereus is to his wyf y-come,
  And in his armes hath his wyf y-nome,
  And pitously he weep, and shook his heed,
  And swor her that he fond her suster deed;                           2345
  For which this sely Progne hath swich wo,
  That ny her sorweful herte brak a-two;                              (120)
  And thus in teres lete I Progne dwelle,
  And of her suster forth I wol yow telle.
    This woful lady lerned had in youthe                               2350
  So that she werken and enbrouden couthe,
  And weven in her stole the radevore
  As hit of women hath be woned yore.
  And, shortly for to seyn, she hath her fille
  Of mete and drink, and clothing at her wille,                        2355
  And coude eek rede, and wel y-nogh endyte,
  But with a penne coude she nat wryte;                               (130)
  But lettres can she weven to and fro,
  So that, by that the yeer was al a-go,
  She had y-woven in a stamin large                                    2360
  How she was broght from Athenes in a barge,
  And in cave how that she was broght;
  And al the thing that Tereus hath wroght,
  She waf hit wel, and wroot the story above,
  How she was served for her suster love;                              2365
  And to a knave a ring she yaf anoon,
  And prayed him, by signes, for to goon                              (140)
  Unto the quene, and beren her that clooth,
  And by signes swor him many an ooth,
  She sholde him yeve what she geten mighte.                           2370
    This knave anoon unto the quene him dighte,
  And took hit her, and al the maner tolde.
  And, whan that Progne hath this thing beholde,
  No word she spak, for sorwe and eek for rage;
  But feyned her to goon on pilgrimage                                 2375
  To Bachus temple; and, in a litel stounde,
  Her dombe suster sitting hath she founde,                           (150)
  Weping in the castel her aloon.
  Allas! the wo, the compleint, and the moon
  That Progne upon her dombe suster maketh!                            2380
  In armes everich of hem other taketh,
  And thus I lete hem in hir sorwe dwelle.
    The remenant is no charge for to telle,
  For this is al and som, thus was she served,
  That never harm a-gilte ne deserved                                  2385
  Unto this cruel man, that she of wiste.
  Ye may be war of men, yif that yow liste.                           (160)
  For, al be that he wol nat, for his shame,
  Doon so as Tereus, to lese his name,
  Ne serve yow as a mordrour or a knave,                               2390
  Ful litel whyle shul ye trewe him have,
  That wol I seyn, al were he now my brother,
  But hit so be that he may have non other.                           (166)

VIII. THE LEGEND OF PHYLLIS.

INCIPIT LEGENDA PHILLIS.

  By preve as wel as by auctoritee,
  That wikked fruit cometh of a wikked tree,                           2395
  That may ye finde, if that it lyketh yow.
  But for this ende I speke this as now,
  To telle you of false Demophon.
  In love a falser herde I never non,
  But-if hit were his fader Theseus.                                   2400
  'God, for his grace, fro swich oon kepe us!'
  Thus may thise women prayen that hit here.
  Now to theffect turne I of my matere.                                (10)
    Destroyed is of Troye the citee;
  This Demophon com sailing in the see                                 2405
  Toward Athenes, to his paleys large;
  With him com many a ship and many a barge
  Ful of his folk, of which ful many oon
  Is wounded sore, and seek, and wo begoon.
  And they han at the sege longe y-lain.                               2410
  Behinde him com a wind and eek a rain
  That shoof so sore, his sail ne mighte stonde,
  Him were lever than al the world a-londe,                            (20)
  So hunteth him the tempest to and fro.
  So derk hit was, he coude nowher go;                                 2415
  And with a wawe brosten was his stere.
  His ship was rent so lowe, in swich manere,
  That carpenter ne coude hit nat amende.
  The see, by nighte, as any torche brende
  For wood, and posseth him now up now doun,                           2420
  Til Neptune hath of him compassioun,
  And Thetis, Chorus, Triton, and they alle,
  And maden him upon a lond to falle,                                  (30)
  Wher-of that Phillis lady was and quene,
  Ligurgus doghter, fairer on to sene                                  2425
  Than is the flour again the brighte sonne.
  Unnethe is Demophon to londe y-wonne,
  Wayk and eek wery, and his folk for-pyned
  Of werinesse, and also enfamyned;
  And to the deeth he almost was y-driven.                             2430
  His wyse folk to conseil han him yiven
  To seken help and socour of the queen,
  And loken what his grace mighte been,                                (40)
  And maken in that lond som chevisaunce,
  To kepen him fro wo and fro mischaunce.                              2435
  For seek was he, and almost at the deeth;
  Unnethe mighte he speke or drawe his breeth,
  And lyth in Rodopeya him for to reste.
  Whan he may walke, him thoughte hit was the beste
  Unto the court to seken for socour.                                  2440
  Men knewe him wel, and diden him honour;
  For at Athenes duk and lord was he,
  As Theseus his fader hadde y-be,                                     (50)
  That in his tyme was of greet renoun,
  No man so greet in al his regioun;                                   2445
  And lyk his fader of face and of stature,
  And fals of love; hit com him of nature;
  As doth the fox Renard, the foxes sone,
  Of kinde he coude his olde faders wone
  Withoute lore, as can a drake swimme,                                2450
  Whan hit is caught and caried to the brimme.
  This honourable Phillis doth him chere,
  Her lyketh wel his port and his manere.                              (60)
  But for I am agroted heer-biforn
  To wryte of hem that been in love forsworn,                          2455
  And eek to haste me in my legende,
  Which to performe god me grace sende,
  Therfor I passe shortly in this wyse;
  Ye han wel herd of Theseus devyse
  In the betraising of fair Adriane,                                   2460
  That of her pite kepte him from his bane.
  At shorte wordes, right so Demophon
  The same wey, the same path hath gon                                 (70)
  That dide his false fader Theseus.
  For unto Phillis hath he sworen thus,                                2465
  To wedden her, and her his trouthe plighte,
  And piked of her al the good he mighte,
  Whan he was hool and sound and hadde his reste;
  And doth with Phillis what so that him leste.
  And wel coude I, yif that me leste so,                               2470
  Tellen al his doing to and fro.
    He seide, unto his contree moste he saile,
  For ther he wolde her wedding apparaile                              (80)
  As fil to her honour and his also.
  And openly he took his leve tho,                                     2475
  And hath her sworn, he wolde nat soiorne,
  But in a month he wolde again retorne.
  And in that lond let make his ordinaunce
  As verray lord, and took the obeisaunce
  Wel and hoomly, and let his shippes dighte,                          2480
  And hoom he goth the nexte wey he mighte;
  For unto Phillis yit ne com he noght.
  And that hath she so harde and sore aboght,                          (90)
  Allas! that, as the stories us recorde,
  She was her owne deeth right with a corde,                           2485
  Whan that she saw that Demophon her trayed.
    But to him first she wroot and faste him prayed
  He wolde come, and her deliver of peyne,
  As I reherse shal a word or tweyne.
  Me list nat vouche-sauf on him to swinke,                            2490
  Ne spende on him a penne ful of inke,
  For fals in love was he, right as his syre;
  The devil sette hir soules bothe a-fyre!                            (100)
  But of the lettre of Phillis wol I wryte
  A word or tweyne, al-thogh hit be but lyte.                          2495
    'Thyn hostesse,' quod she, 'O Demophon,
  Thy Phillis, which that is so wo begon,
  Of Rodopeye, upon yow moot compleyne,
  Over the terme set betwix us tweyne,
  That ye ne holden forward, as ye seyde;                              2500
  Your anker, which ye in our haven leyde,
  Highte us, that ye wolde comen, out of doute,
  Or that the mone ones wente aboute.                                 (110)
  But tymes foure the mone hath hid her face
  Sin thilke day ye wente fro this place,                              2505
  And foure tymes light the world again.
  But for al that, yif I shal soothly sain,
  Yit hath the streem of Sitho nat y-broght
  From Athenes the ship; yit comth hit noght.
  And, yif that ye the terme rekne wolde,                              2510
  As I or other trewe lovers sholde,
  I pleyne not, god wot, beforn my day.'--
    But al her lettre wryten I ne may                                 (120)
  By ordre, for hit were to me a charge;
  Her lettre was right long and ther-to large;                         2515
  But here and there in ryme I have hit laid,
  Ther as me thoughte that she wel hath said.--
    She seide, 'thy sailes comen nat again,
  Ne to thy word ther nis no fey certein;
  But I wot why ye come nat,' quod she;                                2520
  'For I was of my love to you so free.
  And of the goddes that ye han forswore,
  Yif that hir vengeance falle on yow therfore,                       (130)
  Ye be nat suffisaunt to bere the peyne.
  To moche trusted I, wel may I pleyne,                                2525
  Upon your linage and your faire tonge,
  And on your teres falsly out y-wronge.
  How coude ye wepe so by craft?' quod she;
  'May ther swiche teres feyned be?
  Now certes, yif ye wolde have in memorie,                            2530
  Hit oghte be to yow but litel glorie
  To have a sely mayde thus betrayed!
  To god,' quod she, 'preye I, and ofte have prayed,                  (140)
  That hit be now the grettest prys of alle,
  And moste honour that ever yow shal befalle!                         2535
  And whan thyn olde auncestres peynted be,
  In which men may hir worthinesse see,
  Than, preye I god, thou peynted be also,
  That folk may reden, for-by as they go,
  "Lo! this is he, that with his flaterye                              2540
  Betrayed hath and doon her vilanye
  That was his trewe love in thoghte and dede!"
  But sothly, of oo point yit may they rede,                          (150)
  That ye ben lyk your fader as in this;
  For he begyled Adriane, y-wis,                                       2545
  With swiche an art and swiche sotelte
  As thou thy-selven hast begyled me.
  As in that point, al-thogh hit be nat fayr,
  Thou folwest him, certein, and art his eyr.
  But sin thus sinfully ye me begyle,                                  2550
  My body mote ye seen, within a whyle,
  Right in the haven of Athenes fletinge,
  With-outen sepulture and buryinge;                                  (160)
  Thogh ye ben harder then is any stoon.'
    And, whan this lettre was forth sent anoon,                        2555
  And knew how brotel and how fals he was,
  She for dispeyr for-dide herself, allas!
  Swich sorwe hath she, for she besette her so.
  Be war, ye women, of your sotil fo,
  Sin yit this day men may ensample see;                               2560
  And trusteth, as in love, no man but me.                            (168)

IX. THE LEGEND OF HYPERMNESTRA.

INCIPIT LEGENDA YPERMISTRE.

  In Grece whylom weren brethren two,
  Of whiche that oon was called Danao,
  That many a sone hath of his body wonne,
  As swiche false lovers ofte conne.                                   2565
  Among his sones alle ther was oon
  That aldermost he lovede of everichoon.
  And whan this child was born, this Danao
  Shoop him a name, and called him Lino.
  That other brother called was Egiste,                                2570
  That was of love as fals as ever him liste,                          (10)
  And many a doghter gat he in his lyve;
  Of which he gat upon his righte wyve
  A doghter dere, and dide her for to calle
  Ypermistra, yongest of hem alle;                                     2575
  The whiche child, of her nativitee,
  To alle gode thewes born was she,
  As lyked to the goddes, or she was born,
  That of the shefe she sholde be the corn;
  The Wirdes, that we clepen Destinee,                                 2580
  Hath shapen her that she mot nedes be                                (20)
  Pitouse, sadde, wyse, and trewe as steel;
  And to this woman hit accordeth weel.
  For, though that Venus yaf her greet beautee,
  With Iupiter compouned so was she                                    2585
  That conscience, trouthe, and dreed of shame,
  And of her wyfhood for to kepe her name,
  This, thoughte her, was felicitee as here.
  And rede Mars was, that tyme of the yere,
  So feble, that his malice is him raft,                               2590
  Repressed hath Venus his cruel craft;                                (30)
  What with Venus and other oppressioun
  Of houses, Mars his venim is adoun,
  That Ypermistra dar nat handle a knyf
  In malice, thogh she sholde lese her lyf.                            2595
  But natheles, as heven gan tho turne,
  To badde aspectes hath she of Saturne,
  That made her for to deyen in prisoun,
  As I shal after make mencioun.
    To Danao and Egistes also--                                        2600
  Al-thogh so be that they were brethren two,                          (40)
  For thilke tyme nas spared no linage--
  Hit lyked hem to maken mariage
  Betwix Ypermistra and him Lino,
  And casten swiche a day hit shal be so;                              2605
  And ful acorded was hit witterly;
  The array is wroght, the tyme is faste by.
  And thus Lino hath of his fadres brother
  The doghter wedded, and eche of hem hath other.
    The torches brennen and the lampes brighte,                        2610
  The sacrifices been ful redy dighte;                                 (50)
  Thencens out of the fyre reketh sote,
  The flour, the leef is rent up by the rote
  To maken garlands and corounes hye;
  Ful is the place of soun of minstralcye,                             2615
  Of songes amorous of mariage,
  As thilke tyme was the pleyn usage.
  And this was in the paleys of Egiste,
  That in his hous was lord, right as him liste;
  And thus the day they dryven to an ende;                             2620
  The frendes taken leve, and hoom they wende.                         (60)
  The night is come, the bryd shal go to bedde;
  Egiste to his chambre faste him spedde,
  And privily he let his doghter calle.
  Whan that the hous was voided of hem alle,                           2625
  He loked on his doghter with glad chere,
  And to her spak, as ye shul after here.
    'My righte doghter, tresor of myn herte!
  Sin first that day that shapen was my sherte,
  Or by the fatal sustren had my dom,                                  2630
  So ny myn herte never thing me com                                   (70)
  As thou, myn Ypermistra, doghter dere!
  Tak heed what I thy fader sey thee here,
  And werk after thy wyser ever-mo.
  For alderfirste, doghter, I love thee so                             2635
  That al the world to me nis half so leef;
  Ne I nolde rede thee to thy mischeef
  For al the gode under the colde mone;
  And what I mene, hit shal be seid right sone,
  With protestacioun, as in this wyse,                                 2640
  That, but thou do as I shal thee devyse,                             (80)
  Thou shalt be deed, by him that al hath wroght!
  At shorte wordes, thou nescapest noght
  Out of my paleys, or that thou be deed,
  But thou consente and werke after my reed;                           2645
  Tak this to thee for ful conclusioun.'
    This Ypermistra caste her eyen doun,
  And quook as dooth the leef of aspe grene;
  Deed wex her hewe, and lyk as ash to sene,
  And seyde, 'lord and fader, al your wille,                           2650
  After my might, god wot, I shal fulfille,                            (90)
  So hit to me be no confusioun.'
    'I nil,' quod he, 'have noon excepcioun;'
  And out he caughte a knyf, as rasour kene;
  'Hyd this,' quod he, 'that hit be nat y-sene;                        2655
  And, whan thyn husbond is to bedde y-go,
  Whyl that he slepeth, cut his throte a-two.
  For in my dremes hit is warned me
  How that my nevew shal my bane be,
  But whiche I noot, wherfor I wol be siker.                           2660
  Yif thou sey nay, we two shul have a biker                          (100)
  As I have seyd, by him that I have sworn.'
    This Ypermistra hath ny her wit forlon;
  And, for to passen harmles of that place,
  She graunted him; ther was non other grace.                          2665
  And therwith-al a costrel taketh he,
  And seyde, 'herof a draught, or two or three,
  Yif him to drinke, whan he goth to reste,
  And he shal slepe as longe as ever thee leste,
  The narcotiks and opies been so stronge:                             2670
  And go thy wey, lest that him thinke longe.'                        (110)
    Out comth the bryd, and with ful sober chere,
  As is of maidens ofte the manere,
  To chambre is broght with revel and with songe,
  And shortly, lest this tale be to longe,                             2675
  This Lino and she ben sone broght to bedde;
  And every wight out at the dore him spedde.
    The night is wasted, and he fel a-slepe;
  Ful tenderly beginneth she to wepe.
  She rist her up, and dredfully she quaketh,                          2680
  As doth the braunche that Zephirus shaketh,                         (120)
  And husht were alle in Argon that citee.
  As cold as any frost now wexeth she;
  For pite by the herte her streyneth so,
  And dreed of death doth her so moche wo,                             2685
  That thryes doun she fil in swiche a were.
  She rist her up, and stakereth heer and there,
  And on her handes faste loketh she.
  'Allas! and shul my handes blody be?
  I am a maid, and, as by my nature,                                   2690
  And by my semblant and by my vesture,                               (130)
  Myn handes been nat shapen for a knyf,
  As for to reve no man fro his lyf.
  What devil have I with the knyf to do?
  And shal I have my throte corve a-two?                               2695
  Than shal I blede, allas! and me beshende;
  And nedes cost this thing mot have an ende;
  Or he or I mot nedes lese our lyf.
  Now certes,' quod she, 'sin I am his wyf,
  And hath my feith, yit is it bet for me                              2700
  For to be deed in wyfly honestee                                    (140)
  Than be a traitour living in my shame.
  Be as be may, for ernest or for game,
  He shal awake, and ryse and go his way
  Out at this goter, or that hit be day!'--                            2705
  And weep ful tenderly upon his face,
  And in her armes gan him to embrace,
  And him she roggeth and awaketh softe;
  And at the window leep he fro the lofte
  Whan she hath warned him, and doon him bote.                         2710
    This Lino swifte was, and light of fote,                          (150)
  And from his wyf he ran a ful good pas.
  This sely woman is so wayk, allas!
  And helples so, that, or that she fer wente,

  Allas! Lino! why art thou so unkinde?
  Why ne haddest thou remembred in thy minde
  To taken her, and lad her forth with thee?
  For, whan she saw that goon awey was he,
  And that she mighte nat so faste go,                                 2720
  Ne folwen him, she sette her doun right tho,                        (160)

A TREATISE ON THE ASTROLABE.


PROLOGUE.

  Litell Lowis my sone, I have perceived wel by certeyne
  evidences thyn abilite to lerne sciencez touchinge noumbres
  and proporciouns; and as wel considere I thy bisy preyere in
  special to lerne the Tretis of the Astrolabie. Than, for as mechel
  as a philosofre seith, 'he wrappeth him in his frend, that
      condescendeth                                                       5
  to the rightful preyers of his frend,' ther-for have I
  geven thee a suffisaunt Astrolabie as for oure orizonte, compowned
  after the latitude of Oxenford; up-on which, by mediacion of this
  litel tretis, I purpose to teche thee a certein nombre of conclusions
  apertening to the same instrument. I seye a certein of conclusiouns,   10
  for three causes. The furste cause is this: truste wel that alle the
  conclusiouns that han ben founde, or elles possibly mighten be
  founde in so noble an instrument as an Astrolabie, ben un-knowe
  perfitly to any mortal man in this regioun, as I suppose. A-nother
  cause is this; that sothly, in any tretis of the Astrolabie that I
      have                                                               15
  seyn, there ben some conclusions that wole nat in alle thinges
  performen hir bihestes; and some of hem ben to harde to thy
  tendre age of ten yeer to conseyve. This tretis, divided in fyve
  parties, wole I shewe thee under ful lighte rewles and naked
  wordes in English; for Latin ne canstow yit but smal, my lyte          20
  sone. But natheles, suffyse to thee thise trewe conclusiouns in
  English, as wel as suffyseth to thise noble clerkes Grekes thise same
  conclusiouns in Greek, and to Arabiens in Arabik, and to Iewes in
  Ebrew, and to the Latin folk in Latin; whiche Latin folk han hem
  furst out of othre diverse langages, and writen in hir owne tonge,     25
  that is to sein, in Latin. And god wot, that in alle thise langages,
  and in many mo, han thise conclusiouns ben suffisantly lerned and
  taught, and yit by diverse rewles, right as diverse pathes leden
  diverse folk the righte wey to Rome. Now wol I prey meekly
  every discret persone that redeth or hereth this litel tretis, to have 30
  my rewde endyting for excused, and my superfluite of wordes, for
  two causes. The firste cause is, for that curious endyting and hard
  sentence is ful hevy atones for swich a child to lerne. And the
  seconde cause is this, that sothly me semeth betre to wryten un-to
  a child twyes a good sentence, than he for-gete it ones. And           35
  Lowis, yif so be that I shewe thee in my lighte English as trewe
  conclusiouns touching this matere, and naught only as trewe but
  as many and as subtil conclusiouns as ben shewed in Latin in any
  commune tretis of the Astrolabie, con me the more thank; and
  preye god save the king, that is lord of this langage, and alle that   40
  him feyth bereth and obeyeth, everech in his degree, the more and
  the lasse. But considere wel, that I ne usurpe nat to have founde
  this werk of my labour or of myn engin. I nam but a lewd compilatour
  of the labour of olde Astrologiens, and have hit translated
  in myn English only for thy doctrine; and with this swerd shal I       45
  sleen envye.

  I. The firste partie of this tretis shal reherse the figures and the
  membres of thyn Astrolabie, bi-cause that thou shalt han the
  grettre knowing of thyn owne instrument.

  II. The second partie shal teche thee werken the verrey                50
  practik of the forseide conclusiouns, as ferforth and as narwe
  as may be shewed in so smal an instrument portatif aboute.
  For wel wot every astrologien that smalest fraccions ne wol
  nat ben shewed in so smal an instrument, as in subtil tables
  calculed for a cause.                                                  55

  III. The thridde partie shal contienen diverse tables of
  longitudes and latitudes of sterres fixe for the Astrolabie, and
  tables of declinacions of the sonne, and tables of longitudes
  of citeez and of townes; and as wel for the governance of a
  clokke as for to finde the altitude meridian; and many another         60
  notable conclusioun, after the kalendres of the reverent clerkes,
  frere I. Somer and frere N. Lenne.

  IV. The ferthe partie shal ben a theorik to declare the
  moevinge of the celestial bodies with the causes. The whiche
  ferthe partie in special shal shewen a table of the verray             65
  moeving of the mone from houre to houre, every day and in
  every signe, after thyn almenak; upon which table ther folwith
  a canon, suffisant to teche as wel the maner of the wyrking of
  that same conclusioun, as to knowe in oure orizonte with which
  degree of the zodiac that the mone ariseth in any latitude;            70
  and the arising of any planete after his latitude fro the ecliptik
  lyne.

  V. The fifte partie shal ben an introductorie after the statutz
  of oure doctours, in which thou maist lerne a gret part of the
  general rewles of theorik in astrologie. In which fifte partie         75
  shaltow finde tables of equacions of houses aftur the latitude of
  Oxenford; and tables of dignetes of planetes, and other noteful
  thinges, yif god wol vouche-sauf and his modur the mayde, mo
  than I be-hete, &c.


PART I.

HERE BIGINNETH THE DESCRIPCION OF THE ASTROLABIE.

  1. Thyn Astrolabie hath a ring to putten on the thoumbe of
  thy right hand in taking the heighte of thinges. And tak keep, for
  from hennes-forthward, I wol clepe the heighte of any thing that
  is taken by thy rewle, the altitude, with-oute mo wordes.

  2. This ring renneth in a maner turet, fast to the moder of
  thyn Astrolabie, in so rowm a space that hit desturbeth nat the
  instrument to hangen after his righte centre.

  3. The Moder of thyn Astrolabie is the thikkeste plate, perced
  with a large hole, that resseyveth in hir wombe the thinne plates
  compowned for diverse clymatz, and thy riet shapen in manere
  of a net or of a webbe of a loppe; and for the more declaracioun,
  lo here the figure.                                                     5

  4. This moder is devyded on the bak-half with a lyne, that
  cometh dessendinge fro the ring down to the nethereste bordure.
  The whiche lyne, fro the for-seide ring un-to the centre of the
  large hole amidde, is cleped the south lyne, or elles the lyne
  meridional. And the remenant of this lyne downe to the bordure          5
  is cleped the north lyne, or elles the lyne of midnight. And for
  the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  5. Over-thwart this for-seide longe lyne, ther crosseth him
  another lyne of the same lengthe from est to west. Of the
  whiche lyne, from a litel croys + in the bordure un-to the centre
  of the large hole, is cleped the Est lyne, or elles the lyne Orientale;
  and the remenant of this lyne fro the forseide + un-to the bordure,     5
  is cleped the West lyne, or the lyne Occidentale. Now hastow
  here the foure quarters of thin Astrolabie, devyded after the foure
  principals plages or quarters of the firmament. And for the more
  declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  6. The est side of thyn Astrolabie is cleped the right side, and
  the west side is cleped the left side. Forget nat this, litel Lowis.
  Put the ring of thyn Astrolabie upon the thoumbe of thy right
  hand, and thanne wole his right syde be toward thy left syde, and
  his left syde wol be toward thy right syde; tak this rewle general,     5
  as wel on the bak as on the wombe-side. Upon the ende of this
  est lyne, as I first seide, is marked a litel +, wher-as evere-mo
  generaly is considered the entring of the first degree in which the
  sonne aryseth. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the
  figure.                                                                10

  7. Fro this litel + up to the ende of the lyne meridional, under
  the ring, shaltow finden the bordure devyded with 90 degrees;
  and by that same proporcioun is every quarter of thin Astrolabie
  devyded. Over the whiche degrees ther ben noumbres of augrim,
  that devyden thilke same degrees fro fyve to fyve, as sheweth by        5
  longe strykes by-twene. Of whiche longe strykes the space by-twene
  contienith a mile-wey. And every degree of the bordure
  contieneth foure minutes, that is to seyn, minutes of an houre.
  And for more declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  8. Under the compas of thilke degrees ben writen the names of
  the Twelve Signes, as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,
  Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces; and
  the nombres of the degrees of tho signes ben writen in augrim
  above, and with longe devisiouns, fro fyve to fyve; devyded fro         5
  tyme that the signe entreth un-to the laste ende. But understond
  wel, that thise degrees of signes ben everich of hem considered
  of 60 minutes, and every minute of 60 secondes, and so
  forth in-to smale fraccions infinit, as seith Alkabucius. And
  ther-for, know wel, that a degree of the bordure contieneth foure      10
  minutes, and a degree of a signe contieneth 60 minutes, and
  have this in minde. And for the more declaracioun, lo here
  thy figure.

  9. Next this folweth the Cercle of the Dayes, that ben figured
  in maner of degrees, that contienen in noumbre 365; divyded
  also with longe strykes fro fyve to fyve, and the nombres in
  augrim writen under that cercle. And for more declaracioun, lo
  here thy figure.

  10. Next the Cercle of the Dayes, folweth the Cercle of the
  names of the Monthes; that is to seyen, Ianuare, Februare,
  Marcius, Aprile, Mayus, Iuin, Iulius, Augustus, Septembre,
  October, Novembre, Decembre. The names of thise monthes
  were cleped in Arabiens, somme for hir propretees, and some by          5
  statutz of lordes, some by other lordes of Rome. Eek of thise
  monthes, as lyked to Iulius Cesar and to Cesar Augustus, some
  were compowned of diverse nombres of dayes, as Iuil and
  August. Thanne hath Ianuare 31 dayes, Februare 28, March
  31, Aprille 30, May 31, Iunius 30, Iulius 31, Augustus 31,             10
  September 30, Octobre 31, Novembre 30, December 31.
  Natheles, al-though that Iulius Cesar took 2 dayes out of Feverer
  and put hem in his moneth of Iuille, and Augustus Cesar cleped
  the moneth of August after his name, and ordeyned it of 31 dayes,
  yit truste wel, that the sonne dwelleth ther-for nevere the more ne    15
  lesse in oon signe than in another.

  11. Than folwen the names of the Halidayes in the Kalender,
  and next hem the lettres of the Abc. on which they fallen. And
  for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  12. Next the forseide Cercle of the Abc., under the cros-lyne,
  is marked the scale, in maner of two squyres, or elles in manere
  of laddres, that serveth by hise 12 poyntes and his devisiouns of
  ful many a subtil conclusioun.  Of this forseide scale, fro the
  croos-lyne un-to the verre angle, is cleped _umbra versa_, and the      5
  nether partie is cleped the _umbra recta_, or elles _umbra extensa_.
  And for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  13. Thanne hastow a brood Rewle, that hath on either ende a
  square plate perced with a certein holes, some more and some
  lesse, to resseyven the stremes of the sonne by day, and eek
  by mediacioun of thyn eye, to knowe the altitude of sterres by
  nighte. And for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.              5

  14. Thanne is ther a large Pyn, in maner of an extree, that
  goth thorow the hole that halt the tables of the clymates and the
  riet in the wombe of the Moder, thorw which Pyn ther goth a
  litel wegge which that is cleped 'the hors,' that streyneth alle
  thise parties to-hepe; this forseide grete Pyn, in maner of an          5
  extree, is imagined to be the Pol Artik in thyn Astrolabie.
  And for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  15. The wombe-side of thyn Astrolabie is also devyded with a
  longe croys in foure quarters from est to west, fro south to north,
  fro right syde to left syde, as is the bak-syde.  And for the more
  declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  16. The bordure of which wombe-side is devyded fro the poynt
  of the est lyne un-to the poynt of the south lyne under the ring,
  in 90 degres; and by that same proporcioun is every quarter
  devyded as is the bak-syde, that amonteth 360 degrees. And
  understond wel, that degrees of this bordure ben answering and          5
  consentrik to the degrees of the Equinoxial, that is devyded in
  the same nombre as every othere cercle is in the heye hevene.
  This same bordure is devyded also with 23 lettres capitals and a
  smal croys + above the south lyne, that sheweth the 24 houres
  equals of the clokke; and, as I have said, 5 of thise degrees          10
  maken a mile-wey, and 3 mile-wey maken an houre. And every
  degree of this bordure conteneth 4 minutes, and every minut 60
  secoundes; now have I told thee twye. And for the more
  declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  17. The plate under thy riet is descryved with 3 principal
  cercles; of which the leste is cleped the cercle of Cancer, by-cause
  that the heved of Cancer turneth evermor consentrik up-on
  the same cercle. In this heved of Cancer is the grettest declinacioun
  northward of the sonne. And ther-for is he cleped the                   5
  Solsticioun of Somer; whiche declinacioun, aftur Ptholome, is 23
  degrees and 50 minutes, as wel in Cancer as in Capricorne. This
  signe of Cancre is cleped the Tropik of Somer, of _tropos_, that is
  to seyn 'agaynward'; for thanne by-ginneth the sonne to passe
  fro us-ward. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.        10
  The middel cercle in wydnesse, of thise 3, is cleped the Cercle
  Equinoxial; up-on whiche turneth evermo the hedes of Aries and
  Libra. And understond wel, that evermo this Cercle Equinoxial
  turneth iustly fro verrey est to verrey west; as I have shewed thee
  in the spere solide. This same cercle is cleped also the Weyere,       15
  _equator_, of the day; for whan the sonne is in the hevedes of
  Aries and Libra, than ben the dayes and the nightes ilyke of
  lengthe in al the world. And ther-fore ben thise two signes
  called the Equinoxies. And alle that moeveth with-in the
  hevedes of thise Aries and Libra, his moeving is cleped northward;
  and alle that moeveth with-oute thise hevedes, his moeving
  is cleped south-ward as fro the equinoxial. Tak keep of thise
  latitudes north and sowth, and forget it nat. By this Cercle
  Equinoxial ben considered the 24 houres of the clokke; for
  everemo the arysing of 15 degrees of the equinoxial maketh an          25
  houre equal of the clokke. This equinoxial is cleped the girdel
  of the firste moeving, or elles of the _angulus primi motus vel
  primi mobilis_. And _nota_, that firste moeving is cleped 'moeving'
  of the firste moevable of the 8 spere, whiche moeving is fro est to
  west, and eft agayn in-to est; also it is clepid 'girdel' of the first 30
  moeving, for it departeth the firste moevable, that is to seyn, the
  spere, in two ilyke parties, evene-distantz fro the poles of this
  world.

  The wydeste of thise three principal cercles is cleped the
  Cercle of Capricorne, by-cause that the heved of Capricorne            35
  turneth evermo consentrik up-on the same cercle. In the heved
  of this for-seide Capricorne is the grettest declinacioun southward
  of the sonne, and ther-for is it cleped the Solsticioun of Winter.
  This signe of Capricorne is also cleped the Tropik of Winter, for
  thanne byginneth the sonne to come agayn to us-ward. And for           40
  the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  18. Upon this forseide plate ben compassed certein cercles
  that highten Almicanteras, of which som of hem semen perfit
  cercles, and somme semen inperfit. The centre that standith
  a-middes the narwest cercle is cleped the Senith; and the
  netherest cercle, or the firste cercle, is clepid the Orisonte, that    5
  is to seyn, the cercle that devydeth the two emisperies, that is,
  the partie of the hevene a-bove the erthe and the partie be-nethe.
  Thise Almicanteras ben compowned by two and two, al-be-it so
  that on divers Astrolabies some Almicanteras ben devyded by oon,
  and some by two, and somme by three, after the quantite of the         10
  Astrolabie. This forseide senith is imagened to ben the verrey
  point over the crowne of thyn heved; and also this senith is the
  verrey pool of the orisonte in every regioun. And for the
  more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  19. From this senith, as it semeth, ther come a maner crokede
  strykes lyke to the clawes of a loppe, or elles like to the werk of a
  womanes calle, in kerving overthwart the Almikanteras. And
  thise same strykes or divisiouns ben cleped Azimuthz. And they
  devyden the orisonte of thyn Astrolabie in four and twenty              5
  devisiouns. And thise Azimutz serven to knowe the costes of the
  firmament, and to othre conclusiouns, as for to knowe the cenith
  of the sonne and of every sterre. And for more declaracioun, lo
  here thy figure.

  20. Next thise azimutz, under the Cercle of Cancer, ben ther
  twelve devisiouns embelif, moche like to the shap of the azimutes,
  that shewen the spaces of the houres of planetes; and for more
  declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  21. The Riet of thyn Astrolabie with thy zodiak, shapen in
  maner of a net or of a loppe-webbe after the olde descripcioun,
  which thow mayst tornen up and doun as thy-self lyketh, conteneth
  certein nombre of sterres fixes, with hir longitudes and latitudes
  determinat; yif so be that the makere have nat erred. The names         5
  of the sterres ben writen in the margin of the riet ther as they sitte;
  of whiche sterres the smale poynt is cleped the Centre. And
  understond also that alle sterres sittinge with-in the zodiak of thyn
  Astrolabie ben cleped 'sterres of the north,' for they arysen by
  northe the est lyne. And alle the remenant fixed, out of the           10
  zodiak, ben cleped 'sterres of the south;' but I sey nat that they
  arysen alle by southe the est lyne; witnesse on Aldeberan and
  Algomeysa. Generally understond this rewle, that thilke sterres
  that ben cleped sterres of the north arysen rather than the degree
  of hir longitude, and alle the sterres of the south arysen after the   15
  degree of hir longitude; this is to seyn, sterres fixed in thyn
  Astrolabie. The mesure of this longitude of sterres is taken in the
  lyne ecliptik of hevene, under which lyne, whan that the sonne
  and the mone ben lyne-right or elles in the superfice of this lyne,
  than is the eclips of the sonne or of the mone; as I shal declare,     20
  and eek the cause why. But sothly the Ecliptik Lyne of thy
  zodiak is the outtereste bordure of thy zodiak, ther the degrees ben
  marked.

  Thy Zodiak of thyn Astrolabie is shapen as a compas which that
  conteneth a large brede, as after the quantite of thyn Astrolabie;     25
  in ensample that the zodiak in hevene is imagened to ben a superfice
  contening a latitude of twelve degrees, wheras al the remenant
  of cercles in the hevene ben imagined verrey lynes with-oute eny
  latitude. Amiddes this celestial zodiak ys imagined a lyne, which
  that is cleped the Ecliptik Lyne, under which lyne is evermo the       30
  wey of the sonne. Thus ben ther six degrees of the zodiak on
  that on side of the lyne, and six degrees on that other. This
  zodiak is devided in twelve principal devisiouns, that departen the
  twelve signes. And, for the streitnes of thin Astrolabie, than is
  every smal devisioun in a signe departid by two degrees and two;       35
  I mene degrees contening sixty minutes. And this forseide
  hevenissh zodiak is cleped the Cercle of the Signes, or the Cercle
  of the Bestes; for _zodia_ in langage of Greek sowneth 'bestes' in
  Latin tonge; and in the zodiak ben the twelve signes that ban
  names of bestes; or elles, for whan the sonne entreth in any of the    40
  signes, he taketh the propretee of swich bestes; or elles, for that
  the sterres that ben there fixed ben disposed in signes of bestes,
  or shape like bestes; or elles, whan the planetes ben under thilke
  signes, they causen us by hir influence operaciouns and effectes
  lyk to the operaciouns of bestes. And understonde also, that whan      45
  an hot planete cometh in-to an hot signe, than encresseth his hete;
  and yif a planete be cold, thanne amenuseth his coldnesse, by-cause
  of the hote signe. And by this conclusioun maystow take ensample
  in alle the signes, be they moist or drye, or moeble or fix; rekening
  the qualitee of the planete as I first seide. And everich of           50
  thise twelve signes hath respecte to a certein parcelle of the body
  of a man and hath it in governance; as Aries hath thyn heved, and
  Taurus thy nekke and thy throte, Gemini thyn armholes and thyn
  armes, and so forth; as shal be shewed more pleyn in the fifte
  partie of this tretis. This zodiak, which that is part of the eighte   55
  spere, over-kerveth the equinoxial; and he over-kerveth him again
  in evene parties; and that on half declineth southward, and that
  other northward, as pleynly declareth the tretis of the spere. And
  for more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  22. Thanne hastow a label, that is schapen lyk a rewle, save that
  it is streit and hath no plates on either ende with holes; but, with
  the smale point of the forseide label, shallow calcule thyne
  equaciouns in the bordure of thin Astrolabie, as by thyn almury.
  And for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.                      5

  23. Thyn Almury is cleped the Denticle of Capricorne, or elles
  the Calculer. This same Almury sit fix in the bed of Capricorne,
  and it serveth of many a necessarie conclusioun in equaciouns of
  thinges, as shal be shewed; and for the more declaracioun, lo here
  thy figure.                                                             5


HERE ENDETH THE DESCRIPCION OF THE ASTROLABIE.


PART II.

HERE BIGINNEN THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ASTROLABIE.


  1. TO FYNDE THE DEGREE IN WHICH THE SONNE IS DAY BY DAY, AFTER HIR COURS
      A-BOUTE.

  [HIC INCIPIUNT CONCLUSIONES ASTROLABII; ET PRIMA EST AD INVENIENDUM
      GRADUS SOLIS IN QUIBUS SINGULIS DIEBUS SECUNDUM CURSUM SOL EST
      EXISTENS.]

  Rekene and knowe which is the day of thy monthe; and ley
  thy rewle up that same day; and thanne wol the verray point of
  thy rewle sitten in the bordure, up-on the degree of thy sonne.
  Ensample as thus; the yeer of oure lord 1391, the 12 day of
  March at midday, I wolde knowe the degree of the sonne. I               5
  soughte in the bak-half of myn Astrolabie, and fond the cercle of
  the dayes, the which I knowe by the names of the monthes writen
  under the same cercle. Tho leide I my rewle over this forseide
  day, and fond the point of my rewle in the bordure up-on the
  firste degree of Aries, a litel with-in the degree; and thus knowe     10
  I this conclusioun. Another day, I wolde knowe the degree of
  my sonne, and this was at midday in the 13 day of Decembre; I
  fond the day of the monthe in maner as I seide; tho leide I my
  rewle up-on this forseide 13 day, and fond the point of my rewle
  in the bordure up-on the first degree of Capricorne, a lite with-in    15
  the degree; and than hadde I of this conclusioun the ful
  experience. And for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  2. TO KNOWE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SONNE, OR OF OTHRE CELESTIAL BODIES.

  [DE ALTITUDINE SOLIS ET ALIORUM CORPORUM SUPRA CELESTIUM.]

  Put the ring of thyn Astrolabie up-on thy right thoumbe, and
  turne thy lift syde agayn the light of the sonne. And remeve
  thy rewle up and doun, til that the stremes of the sonne shyne
  thorgh bothe holes of thy rewle. Loke thanne how many degrees
  thy rewle is areised fro the litel crois up-on thyn est line, and tak   5
  ther the altitude of thy sonne. And in this same wyse maistow
  knowe by nighte the altitude of the mone, or of brighte sterres.
  This chapitre is so general ever in oon, that ther nedith no more
  declaracion; but forget it nat. And for the more declaracioun,
  lo here the figure.                                                    10

  3. TO KNOWE EVERY TYME OF THE DAY BY LIGHT OF THE SONNE, AND EVERY TYME
      OF THE NIGHT BY THE STERRES FIXE, AND EKE TO KNOWE BY NIGHT OR BY DAY
      THE DEGREE OF ANY SIGNE THAT ASSENDETH ON THE EST ORISONTE, WHICH
      THAT IS CLEPED COMMUNLY THE ASSENDENT, OR ELLES ORUSCUPUM.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM QUODLIBET TEMPUS DIEI PER SOLIS INDICACIONEM, ET
      QUODLIBET TEMPUS NOCTIS PER QUASDAM STELLAS IN CELO FIXAS; AC ECIAM
      AD INVENIENDUM ET COGNOSCENDUM SIGNUM SUPER ORIZONTEM QUI COMMUNITER
      VOCATUR ASCENDENS.]

  Tak the altitude of the sonne whan thee list, as I have said; and
  set the degree of the sonne, in cas that it be by-forn the middel of
  the day, among thyn almikanteras on the est side of thyn
  Astrolabie; and yif it be after the middel of the day, set the degree
  of thy sonne up-on the west side; tak this manere of setting for a      5
  general rewle, ones for evere. And whan thou hast set the degree
  of thy sonne up as many almikanteras of heyghte as was the
  altitude of the sonne taken by thy rewle, ley over thy label, up-on
  the degree of the sonne; and thanne wol the point of thy label
  sitten in the bordure, up-on the verrey tyd of the day. Ensample       10
  as thus: the yeer of oure lord 1391, the 12 day of March, I wold
  knowe the tyd of the day. I took the altitude of my sonne, and
  fond that it was 25 degrees and 30 of minutes of heyghte in the
  bordure on the bak-syde. Tho turnede I myn Astrolabie, and by-cause
  that it was by-forn midday, I turnede my riet, and sette the           15
  degree of the sonne, that is to seyn, the 1 degree of Aries, on the
  right syde of myn Astrolabie, up-on that 25 degrees and 30 of
  minutes of heyghte among myn almikanteras; tho leide I my label
  up-on the degree of my sonne, and fond the poynte of my label in
  the bordure, up-on a capital lettre that is cleped an X; tho rekened   20
  I alle the capitalles lettres fro the lyne of midnight un-to this
      forseide
  lettre X, and fond that it was 9 of the clokke of the day.
  Tho loked I down up-on the est orisonte, and fond there the 20
  degree of Geminis assending; which that I tok for myn assendent.
  And in this wyse hadde I the experience for ever-mo in which           25
  maner I sholde knowe the tyd of the day, and eek myn assendent.
  Tho wolde I wite the same night folwing the hour of the
  night, and wroughte in this wyse. Among an heep of sterris fixe,
  it lyked me for to take the altitude of the feire white sterre that is
  cleped Alhabor; and fond hir sitting on the west side of the lyne      30
  of midday, 18 degres of heighte taken by my rewle on the bak-syde.
  Tho sette I the centre of this Alhabor up-on 18 degrees among
  myn almikanteras, up-on the west syde; by-cause that she was
  founden on the west syde. Tho leide I my label over the degree
  of the sonne that was descended under the weste orisonte, and          35
  rikened alle the lettres capitals fro the lyne of midday un-to the
  point of my label in the bordure; and fond that it was passed 8 of
  the clokke the space of 2 degrees. Tho loked I doun up-on myn
  est orisonte, and fond ther 23 degrees of Libra assending, whom I
  tok for myn assendent; and thus lerned I to knowe ones for ever        40
  in which manere I shuld come to the houre of the night and to
  myn assendent; as verreyly as may be taken by so smal an instrument.
  But natheles, in general, wolde I warne thee for evere, ne
  mak thee nevere bold to have take a iust ascendent by thyn
  Astrolabie, or elles to have set iustly a clokke, whan any celestial   45
  body by which that thow wenest governe thilke thinges ben ney
  the south lyne; for trust wel, whan that the sonne is ney the
  meridional lyne, the degree of the sonne renneth so longe consentrik
  up-on the almikanteras, that sothly thou shalt erre fro the iust
  assendent. The same conclusioun sey I by the centre of any             50
  sterre fix by night; and more-over, by experience, I wot wel that
  in oure orisonte, from 11 of the clokke un-to oon of the clokke,
  in taking of a iust assendent in a portatif Astrolabie, hit is to hard
  to knowe. I mene, from 11 of the clokke biforn the houre of
  noon til oon of the clok next folwing. And for the more declaracion,   55
  lo here thy figure.

  4. SPECIAL DECLARACION OF THE ASSENDENT.

  [SPECIALIS DECLARACIO DE ASCENDENTE.]

  The assendent sothly, as wel in alle nativitez as in questiouns
  and elecciouns of tymes, is a thing which that thise astrologiens
  gretly observen; wher-fore me semeth convenient, sin that I
  speke of the assendent, to make of it special declaracioun. The
  assendent sothly, to take it at the largeste, is thilke degree that     5
  assendeth at any of thise forseide tymes upon the est orisonte;
  and there-for, yif that any planet assende at that same tyme in
  thilke for-seide degree of his longitude, men seyn that thilke
  planete is _in horoscopo_. But sothly, the hous of the assendent,
  that is to seyn, the firste hous or the est angle, is a thing more     10
  brood and large. For after the statutz of astrologiens, what
  celestial body that is 5 degres above thilk degree that assendeth,
  or with-in that noumbre, that is to seyn, nere the degree that
  assendeth, yit rikne they thilke planet in the assendent. And
  what planete that is under thilke degree that assendith the space      15
  of 25 degrees, yit seyn they that thilke planete is lyk to him that
  is in the hous of the assendent; but sothly, yif he passe the
  bondes of thise forseide spaces, above or bynethe, they seyn
  that the planete is failling fro the assendent. Yit sein thise
  astrologiens, that the assendent, and eke the lord of the assendent,   20
  may be shapen for to be fortunat or infortunat, as thus: a fortunat
  assendent clepen they whan that no wykkid planete, as Saturne
  or Mars, or elles the Tail of the Dragoun, is in the hous of the
  assendent, ne that no wikked planete have non aspecte of enemite
  up-on the assendent; but they wol caste that they have a fortunat      25
  planete in hir assendent and yit in his felicitee, and than sey they
  that it is wel. Forther-over, they seyn that the infortuning of an
  assendent is the contrarie of thise forseide thinges. The lord of
  the assendent, sey they, that he is fortunat, whan he is in good
  place fro the assendent as in angle; or in a succedent, where-as       30
  he is in his dignitee and conforted with frendly aspectes of planetes
  and wel resceived, and eek that he may seen the assendent, and
  that he be nat retrograd ne combust, ne ioigned with no shrewe
  in the same signe; ne that he be nat in his descencioun, ne
  ioigned with no planete in his discencioun, ne have up-on him          35
  non aspecte infortunat; and than sey they that he is wel. Natheles,
  thise ben observauncez of iudicial matiere and rytes of payens,
  in which my spirit ne hath no feith, ne no knowing of hir _horoscopum_;
  for they seyn that every signe is departed in 3 evene
  parties by 10 degrees, and thilke porcioun they clepe a Face.          40
  And al-thogh that a planete have a latitude fro the ecliptik, yit
  sey some folk, so that the planete aryse in that same signe with
  any degree of the forseide face in which his longitude is rekned,
  that yit is the planete _in horoscopo_, be it in nativite or in
      eleccioun,
  &c. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.                 45

  5. TO KNOWE THE VERREY EQUACIOUN OF THE DEGREE OF THE SONNE, YIF SO BE
      THAT IT FALLE BY-TWIXE THYN ALMIKANTERAS.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM VERAM EQUACIONEM DE GRADU SOLIS, SI CONTIGERIT FORE IN
      DUAS ALMICANTERAS.]

  For as moche as the almikanteras in thyn Astrolabie been
  compouned by two and two, where-as some almikanteras in
  sondry Astrolabies ben compouned by on and on, or elles by two
  and two, it is necessarie to thy lerning to teche thee first to knowe
  and worke with thyn owne instrument. Wher-for, whan that the            5
  degree of thy sonne falleth by-twixe two almikanteras, or elles yif
  thyn almikanteras ben graven with over gret a point of a compas,
  (for bothe thise thinges may causen errour as wel in knowing of
  the tyd of the day as of the verrey assendent), thou most werken
  in this wyse. Set the degree of thy sonne up-on the heyer              10
  almikanteras of bothe, and waite wel wher as thin almury toucheth
  the bordure, and set ther a prikke of inke. Set doun agayn the
  degree of thy sonne up-on the nethere almikanteras of bothe, and
  set ther another prikke. Remewe thanne thyn almury in the
  bordure evene amiddes bothe prikkes, and this wol lede iustly the      15
  degree of thy sonne to sitte by-twixe bothe almikanteras in his
  right place. Ley thanne thy label over the degree of thy sonne;
  and find in the bordure the verrey tyde of the day or of the night.
  And as verreyly shaltow finde up-on thyn est orisonte thyn assendent.
  And for more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.                         20

  6. TO KNOWE THE SPRING OF THE DAWING AND THE ENDE OF THE EVENING, THE
      WHICH BEN CALLED THE TWO CREPUSCULIS:

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM ORTUM SOLIS ET EIUS OCCASUM, QUE VOCATUR VULGARITER
      CREPUSCULUM.]

  Set the nadir of thy sonne up-on 18 degrees of heighte among
  thyn almikanteras on the west syde, and ley thy label on the degree
  of thy sonne, and thanne shal the poynt of thy label schewe the
  spring of day. Also set the nadir of thy sonne up-on 18 degrees
  of heighte a-mong thyn almikanteras on the est side, and ley over       5
  thy label up-on the degree of the sonne, and with the point of
  thy label find in the bordure the ende of the evening, that is,
  verrey night. The nadir of the sonne is thilke degree that is
  opposit to the degree of the sonne, in the seventhe signe, as thus:
  every degree of Aries by ordre is nadir to every degree of Libra       10
  by ordre; and Taurus to Scorpion; Gemini to Sagittare; Cancer
  to Capricorne; Leo to Aquarie; Virgo to Pisces; and yif any degree
  in thy zodiak be dirk, his nadir shal declare him. And for the
  more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  7. TO KNOWE THE ARCH OF THE DAY, THAT SOME FOLK CALLEN THE DAY
      ARTIFICIAL, FROM THE SONNE ARYSING TIL HIT GO TO RESTE.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM ARCHUM DIEI, QUEM VULGUS VOCAT DIEM ARTIFICIALEM, IN
      HOC, AB ORTU SOLIS USQUE AD OCCASUM.]

  Set the degree of thy sonne up-on thyn est orisonte, and ley
  thy label on the degree of the sonne, and at the poynt of thy
  label in the bordure set a prikke. Turn thanne thy riet aboute
  til the degree of the sonne sit up-on the west orisonte, and ley
  thy label up-on the same degree of the sonne, and at the point of       5
  thy label set a-nother prikke. Rekne thanne the quantitee of
  tyme in the bordure by-twixe bothe prikkes, and tak ther thyn ark
  of the day. The remenant of the bordure under the orisonte is
  the ark of the night. Thus maistow rekne bothe arches, or
  every porcion, of whether that thee lyketh. And by this manere         10
  of wyrking maistow see how longe that any sterre fix dwelleth above
  the erthe, fro tyme that he ryseth til he go to reste. But
  the day natural, that is to seyn 24 houres, is the revolucioun of
  the equinoxial with as moche partie of the zodiak as the sonne
  of his propre moevinge passeth in the mene whyle. And for the          15
  more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  8. TO TURN THE HOURES IN-EQUALES IN HOURES EQUALES.

  [AD CONVERTENDUM HORAS INEQUALES IN HORAS EQUALES.]

  Knowe the nombre of the degrees in the houres in-equales, and
  departe hem by 15, and tak ther thyn houres equales. And for
  the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  9. TO KNOWE THE QUANTITEE OF THE DAY VULGARE, THAT IS TO SEYEN, FROM
      SPRING OF THE DAY UN-TO VERREY NIGHT.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM QUANTITATEM DIEI VULGARIS, VIZ. AB ORTU DIEI USQUE AD
      NOCTEM.]

  Know the quantitee of thy crepusculis, as I have taught in the
  chapitre bi-forn, and adde hem to the arch of thy day artificial;
  and tak ther the space of alle the hole day vulgar, un-to verrey
  night. The same manere maystow worke, to knowe the quantitee
  of the vulgar night. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the         5
  figure.

  10. TO KNOWE THE QUANTITE OF HOURES IN-EQUALES BY DAY.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM HORAS INEQUALES IN DIE.]

  Understond wel, that thise houres in-equales ben cleped houres
  of planetes, and understond wel that som-tyme ben they lengere
  by day than by night, and som-tyme the contrarie. But understond
  wel, that evermo, generaly, the hour in-equal of the day
  with the houre in-equal of the night contenen 30 degrees of the         5
  bordure, whiche bordure is ever-mo answering to the degrees of
  the equinoxial; wher-for departe the arch of the day artificial in
  12, and tak ther the quantitee of the houre in-equal by day.
  And yif thow abate the quantitee of the houre in-equal by daye
  out of 30, than shal the remenant that leveth performe the houre       10
  inequal by night. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the
  figure.

  11. TO KNOWE THE QUANTITE OF HOURES EQUALES.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM QUANTITATEM HORARUM INEQUALIUM.]

  The quantitee of houres equales, that is to seyn, the houres of
  the clokke, ben departed by 15 degrees al-redy in the bordure
  of thyn Astrolabie, as wel by night as by day, generaly for evere.
  What nedeth more declaracioun? Wher-for, whan thee list to
  know how manye houres of the clokke ben passed, or any part of          5
  any of thise houres that ben passed, or elles how many houres or
  partie of houres ben to come, fro swich a tyme to swich a tyme,
  by day or by nighte, knowe the degree of thy sonne, and ley thy
  label on it; turne thy riet aboute ioyntly with thy label, and with
  the point of it rekne in the bordure fro the sonne aryse un-to         10
  the same place ther thou desirest, by day as by nighte. This
  conclusioun wol I declare in the laste chapitre of the 4 partie of
  this tretis so openly, that ther shal lakke no worde that nedeth to
  the declaracioun. And for the more declaracioun, lo here the
  figure.                                                                15

  12. SPECIAL DECLARACIOUN OF THE HOURES OF PLANETES.

  [SPECIALIS DECLARACIO DE HORIS PLANETARUM.]

  Understond wel, that evere-mo, fro the arysing of the sonne til
  it go to reste, the nadir of the sonne shal shewe the houre of the
  planete, and fro that tyme forward al the night til the sonne
  aryse; than shal the verrey degree of the sonne shewe the houre
  of the planete. Ensample as thus. The 13 day of March fil               5
  up-on a Saterday per aventure, and, at the arising of the sonne, I
  fond the secounde degree of Aries sitting up-on myn est orisonte,
  al-be-it that it was but lite; than fond I the 2 degree of Libra,
  nadir of my sonne, dessending on my west orisonte, up-on which
  west orisonte every day generally, at the sonne ariste, entreth        10
  the houre of any planete, after which planete the day bereth his
  name; and endeth in the nexte stryk of the plate under the
  forseide west orisonte; and evere, as the sonne climbeth uppere
  and uppere, so goth his nadir dounere and dounere, teching by
  swich strykes the houres of planetes by ordre as they sitten in        15
  the hevene. The first houre inequal of every Satterday is to
  Saturne; and the secounde, to Iupiter; the 3, to Mars; the 4,
  to the Sonne; the 5, to Venus; the 6, to Mercurius; the 7, to
  the Mone; and thanne agayn, the 8 is to Saturne; the 9, to
  Iupiter; the 10, to Mars; the 11, to the Sonne; the 12, to             20
  Venus; and now is my sonne gon to reste as for that Setterday.
  Thanne sheweth the verrey degree of the sonne the houre of
  Mercurie entring under my west orisonte at eve; and next him
  succedeth the Mone; and so forth by ordre, planete after
  planete, in houre after houre, al the night longe til the sonne        25
  aryse. Now ryseth the sonne that Sonday by the morwe; and
  the nadir of the sonne, up-on the west orizonte, sheweth me the
  entring of the houre of the forseide sonne. And in this maner
  succedeth planete under planete, fro Saturne un-to the Mone,
  and fro the Mone up a-gayn to Saturne, houre after houre               30
  generaly. And thus knowe I this conclusioun. And for the
  more declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  13. TO KNOWE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SONNE IN MIDDES OF THE DAY, THAT IS
      CLEPED THE ALTITUDE MERIDIAN.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM ALTITUDINEM SOLIS IN MEDIO DIEI, QUE VOCATUR ALTITUDO
      MERIDIANA.]

  Set the degree of the sonne up-on the lyne meridional, and
  rikene how many degrees of almikanteras ben by-twixe thyn est
  orisonte and the degree of the sonne. And tak ther thyn altitude
  meridian; this is to seyne, the heyest of the sonne as for that day.
  So maystow knowe in the same lyne, the heyest cours that any            5
  sterre fix climbeth by night; this is to seyn, that whan any sterre
  fix is passed the lyne meridional, than by-ginneth it to descende,
  and so doth the sonne. And for the more declaracioun, lo here
  thy figure.

  14. TO KNOWE THE DEGREE OF THE SONNE BY THY RIET, FOR A MANER CURIOSITEE,
      &C.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM GRADUM SOLIS CURIOSE.]

  Sek bysily with thy rewle the heyest of the sonne in midde of
  the day; turne thanne thyn Astrolabie, and with a prikke of ink
  marke the nombre of that same altitude in the lyne meridional.
  Turne thanne thy riet a-boute til thou fynde a degree of thy
  zodiak acording with the prikke, this is to seyn, sittinge on the       5
  prikke; and in sooth, thou shalt finde but two degrees in al the
  zodiak of that condicioun; and yit thilke two degrees ben in
  diverse signes; than maistow lightly by the sesoun of the yere
  knowe the signe in whiche that is the sonne. And for the

  Understond wel that thy zodiak is departid in two halfe cercles,
  as fro the heved of Capricorne un-to the heved of Cancer; and
  agaynward fro the heved of Cancer un-to the heved of Capricorne.
  The heved of Capricorne is the lowest point, wher-as the sonne
  goth in winter; and the heved of Cancer is the heyest point, in         5
  whiche the sonne goth in somer. And ther-for understond wel,
  that any two degrees that ben y-lyke fer fro any of thise two

  a-non right by som maner sterre fix which that thou
  knowest; and for-get nat the altitude of the firste sterre, ne thyn

  same firste sterre passeth any-thing the south westward, and hath
  him a-non right in the same noumbre of altitude on the west side
  of this lyne meridional as he was caught on the est side; and tak
  a newe assendent a-non right by som maner sterre fixe which that
  thou knowest; and for-get nat this secounde assendent. And             10
  whan that this is don, rikne thanne how manye degrees ben by-twixe
  the firste assendent and the seconde assendent, and rikne
  wel the middel degree by-twene bothe assendentes, and set thilke

  that sit up-on the lyne meridional, and tak ther the verrey degree     15
  of the ecliptik in which the sterre stondeth for the tyme. For in
  the ecliptik is the longitude of a celestial body rekened, evene fro
  the heved of Aries un-to the ende of Pisces. And his latitude is
  rikned after the quantite of his declinacion, north or south to-warde
  the poles of this world; as thus. Yif it be of the sonne or of any     20
  fix sterre, rekene his latitude or his declinacioun fro the equinoxial
  cercle; and yif it be of a planete, rekne than the quantitee of his
  latitude fro the ecliptik lyne. Al-be-it so that fro the equinoxial
  may the declinacion or the latitude of any body celestial be rikned,
  after the site north or south, and after the quantitee of his
      declinacion.                                                       25
  And right so may the latitude or the declinacion of any

  Set the centre of the sterre up-on the est orisonte, and loke
  what degree of any signe that sit up-on the same orisonte at that
  same tyme. And understond wel, that with that same degree
  aryseth that same sterre; and this merveyllous arysing with a
  strange degree in another signe is by-cause that the latitude of the    5
  sterre fix is either north or south fro the equinoxial. But sothly
  the latitudes of planetes ben comunly rekned fro the ecliptik,
  bi-cause that non of hem declineth but fewe degrees out fro the
  brede of the zodiak. And tak good keep of this chapitre of arysing
  of the celestial bodies; for truste wel, that neyther mone ne sterre   10
  as in oure embelif orisonte aryseth with that same degree of his
  longitude, save in o cas; and that is, whan they have no latitude
  fro the ecliptik lyne. But natheles, som tyme is everiche of thise

  thanne thy riet, and set the heved of Aries or Libra in the same
  meridional lyne, and set ther a-nother prikke. And whan that            5
  this is don, considere the altitudes of hem bothe; for sothly the
  difference of thilke altitudes is the declinacion of thilke degree
  fro the equinoxial. And yif so be that thilke degree be northward
  fro the equinoxial, than is his declinacion north; yif it be southward,
  than is it south. And for the more declaracioun, lo here               10

  Understond wel, that as fer is the heved of Aries or Libra in the
  equinoxial from oure orisonte as is the senith from the pole artik;
  and as hey is the pol artik fro the orisonte, as the equinoxial is
  fer fro the senith. I prove it thus by the latitude of Oxenford.
  Understond wel, that the heyghte of oure pool artik fro oure north      5
  orisonte is 51 degrees and 50 minutes; than is the senith from
  oure pool artik 38 degrees and 10 minutes; than is the equinoxial
  from oure senith 51 degrees and 50 minutes; than is oure south
  orisonte from oure equinoxial 38 degrees and 10 minutes. Understond
  wel this rekning. Also for-get nat that the senith is 90               10
  degrees of heyghte fro the orisonte, and oure equinoxial is 90
  degrees from oure pool artik. Also this shorte rewle is soth, that
  the latitude of any place in a regioun is the distance fro the senith

  23. TO PROVE EVIDENTLY THE LATITUDE OF ANY PLACE IN A REGIOUN, BY THE
      PREVE OF THE HEYGHTE OF THE POL ARTIK IN THAT SAME PLACE.

  [AD PROBANDUM EVIDENTER LATITUDINEM ALICUIUS LOCI IN ALIQUA REGIONE, PER
      PROBACIONEM ALTITUDINIS DE POLO ARTICO IN EODEM LOCO.]

  In some winters night, whan the firmament is clere and thikke-sterred,
  waite a tyme til that any sterre fix sit lyne-right perpendiculer
  over the pol artik, and clepe that sterre A. And
  wayte a-nother sterre that sit lyne-right under A, and under the
  pol, and clepe that sterre F. And understond wel, that F is nat         5
  considered but only to declare that A sit evene overe the pool.
  Tak thanne a-non right the altitude of A from the orisonte, and
  forget it nat. Lat A and F go farwel til agayns the dawening a
  gret whyle; and come thanne agayn, and abyd til that A is evene
  under the pol and under F; for sothly, than wol F sitte over the pool, 10
  and A wol sitte under the pool. Tak than eft-sones the altitude of
  A from the orisonte, and note as wel his secounde altitude as his
  firste altitude; and whan that this is don, rikne how manye degrees
  that the firste altitude of A excedeth his seconde altitude, and tak
  half thilke porcioun that is exceded, and adde it to his seconde       15
  altitude; and tak ther the elevacioun of thy pool, and eke the
  latitude of thy regioun. For thise two ben of a nombre; this is
  to seyn, as many degrees as thy pool is elevat, so michel is the
  latitude of the regioun. Ensample as thus: par aventure, the
  altitude of A in the evening is 56 degrees of heyghte. Than            20
  wol his seconde altitude or the dawing be 48; that is 8 lasse than
  56, that was his firste altitude at even. Take thanne the half of
  8, and adde it to 48, that was his seconde altitude, and than
  hastow 52. Now hastow the heyghte of thy pol, and the latitude
  of the regioun. But understond wel, that to prove this conclusioun     25
  and many a-nother fair conclusioun, thou most have a plomet
  hanging on a lyne heyer than thin heved on a perche; and thilke
  lyne mot hange evene perpendiculer by-twixe the pool and thyn
  eye; and thanne shaltow seen yif A sitte evene over the pool and
  over F at evene; and also yif F sitte evene over the pool and          30
  over A or day. And for more declaracion, lo here thy figure.

  24. ANOTHER CONCLUSIOUN TO PROVE THE HEYGHTE OF THE POOL ARTIK FRO THE
      ORISONTE.

  [ALIA CONCLUSIO AD PROBANDUM ALTITUDINEM DE POLO ARTICO AB ORIZONTE.]

  Tak any sterre fixe that nevere dissendeth under the orisonte in
  thilke regioun, and considere his heyest altitude and his lowest
  altitude fro the orisonte; and make a nombre of bothe thise
  altitudes. Tak thanne and abate half that nombre, and tak ther
  the elevacioun of the pol artik in that same regioun. And for           5
  more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  25. A-NOTHER CONCLUSIOUN TO PROVE THE LATITUDE OF THE REGIOUN, &C.

  [ALIA CONCLUSIO AD PROBANDUM LATITUDINEM REGIONIS.]

  Understond wel that the latitude of any place in a regioun is
  verreyly the space by-twixe the senith of hem that dwellen there
  and the equinoxial cerkle, north or southe, taking the mesure in
  the meridional lyne, as sheweth in the almikanteras of thyn
  Astrolabie. And thilke space is as moche as the pool artik is hey       5
  in the same place fro the orisonte. And than is the depressioun
  of the pol antartik, that is to seyn, than is the pol antartik by-nethe
  the orisonte, the same quantite of space, neither more ne lasse.
  Thanne, yif thow desire to knowe this latitude of the regioun, tak
  the altitude of the sonne in the middel of the day, whan the sonne     10
  is in the hevedes of Aries or of Libra; (for thanne moeveth the
  sonne in the lyne equinoxial); and abate the nombre of that same
  sonnes altitude out of 90, and thanne is the remenaunt of the
  noumbre that leveth the latitude of the regioun. As thus: I
  suppose that the sonne is thilke day at noon 38 degrees and 10         15
  minutes of heyghte. Abate thanne thise degrees and minutes out
  of 90; so leveth there 51 degrees and 50 minutes, the latitude.
  I sey nat this but for ensample; for wel I wot the latitude of
  Oxenforde is certein minutes lasse, as I mighte prove. Now yif
  so be that thee semeth to long a taryinge, to abyde til that the       20
  sonne be in the hevedes of Aries or of Libra, thanne waite whan
  the sonne is in any other degree of the zodiak, and considere the
  degree of his declinacion fro the equinoxial lyne; and yif it so be
  that the sonnes declinacion be northward fro the equinoxial, abate
  thanne fro the sonnes altitude at noon the nombre of his declinacion,  25
  and thanne hastow the heyghte of the hevedes of Aries
  and Libra. As thus: my sonne is, par aventure, in the firste
  degre of Leoun, 58 degrees and 10 minutes of heyghte at noon
  and his declinacion is almost 20 degrees northward fro the
  equinoxial; abate thanne thilke 20 degrees of declinacion out of       30
  the altitude at noon, than leveth thee 38 degrees and odde minutes;
  lo ther the heved of Aries or Libra, and thyn equinoxial in that
  regioun. Also yif so be that the sonnes declinacioun be southward
  fro the equinoxial, adde thanne thilke declinacion to the
  altitude of the sonne at noon; and tak ther the hevedes of Aries       35
  and Libra, and thyn equinoxial. Abate thanne the heyghte of
  the equinoxial out of 90 degrees, and thanne leveth there the
  distans of the pole, 51 degrees and 50 minutes, of that regioun
  fro the equinoxial. Or elles, yif thee lest, take the heyest altitude
  fro the equinoxial of any sterre fix that thou knowest, and tak his    40
  nethere elongacioun lengthing fro the same equinoxial lyne, and
  wirke in the maner forseid. And for more declaracion, lo here
  thy figure.

  26. DECLARACIOUN OF THE ASSENSIOUN OF SIGNES, &C.

  [DECLARACIO DE ASCENSIONE SIGNORUM.]

  The excellence of the spere solide, amonges other noble conclusiouns,
  sheweth manifeste the diverse assenciouns of signes
  in diverse places, as wel in the righte cercle as in the embelif
  cercle. Thise auctours wryten that thilke signe is cleped of right
  ascensioun, with which more part of the cercle equinoxial and           5
  lasse part of the zodiak ascendeth; and thilke signe assendeth
  embelif, with whiche lasse part of the equinoxial and more part of
  the zodiak assendeth. Ferther-over they seyn, that in thilke
  cuntrey where as the senith of hem that dwellen there is in the
  equinoxial lyne, and her orisonte passing by the poles of this         10
  worlde, thilke folke han this right cercle and the right orisonte;
  and evere-mo the arch of the day and the arch of the night is ther
  y-like long, and the sonne twyes every yeer passinge thorow the
  senith of her heved; and two someres and two winteres in a yeer
  han this forseide poeple. And the almikanteras in her Astrolabies      15
  ben streighte as a lyne, so as sheweth in this figure. The utilite to
  knowe the assenciouns in the righte cercle is this: truste wel that
  by mediacioun of thilke assenciouns thise astrologiens, by hir
  tables and hir instrumentz, knowen verreyly the assencioun of
  every degree and minut in al the zodiak, as shal be shewed. And        20
  _nota_, that this forseid righte orisonte, that is cleped _orison
      rectum_,
  divydeth the equinoxial in-to right angles; and the embelif orisonte,
  wher-as the pol is enhaused up-on the orisonte, overkerveth the
  equinoxial in embelif angles, as sheweth in the figure. And for
  the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.                             25

  27. THIS IS THE CONCLUSIOUN TO KNOWE THE ASSENCIOUNS OF SIGNES IN THE

  Set the heved of what signe thee liste to knowe his assending in

  almury toucheth the bordure, and set ther a prikke. Turne
  thanne thy riet westward til that the ende of the forseide signe
  sitte up-on the meridional lyne; and eft-sones waite wher thyn          5
  almury toucheth the bordure, and set ther another prikke. Rikne
  thanne the nombre of degrees in the bordure by-twixe bothe

  Set the heved of the signe which as thee list to knowe his
  ascensioun up-on the est orisonte, and waite wher thyn almury
  toucheth the bordure, and set ther a prikke. Turne thanne thy
  riet upward til that the ende of the same signe sitte up-on the est

  bordure, and set ther a-nother prikke. Rikne thanne the noumbre
  of degrees in the bordure by-twixe bothe prikkes, and tak ther the
  assencioun of the signe in the embelif cercle. And understond
  wel, that alle signes in thy zodiak, fro the heved of Aries unto the
  ende of Virgo, ben cleped signes of the north fro the equinoxial;      10
  and these signes arysen by-twixe the verrey est and the verrey
  north in oure orisonte generaly for evere. And alle signes fro the
  heved of Libra un-to the ende of Pisces ben cleped signes of the
  south fro the equinoxial; and thise signes arysen ever-mo by-twixe
  the verrey est and the verrey south in oure orisonte. Also every       15
  signe by-twixe the heved of Capricorne un-to the ende of Geminis
  aryseth on oure orisonte in lasse than two houres equales; and
  thise same signes, fro the heved of Capricorne un-to the ende of
  Geminis, ben cleped 'tortuos signes' or 'croked signes,' for
  they arisen embelif on oure orisonte; and thise crokede signes         20
  ben obedient to the signes that ben of right assencioun. The
  signes of right assencioun ben fro the heved of Cancer to the
  ende of Sagittare; and thise signes arysen more upright, and they
  ben called eke sovereyn signes; and everich of hem aryseth in
  more space than in two houres. Of which signes, Gemini obeyeth         25

  Astrolabie is this; I mene, as in this cas. First is it devided in     10
  4 plages principalx with the lyne that goth from est to west, and
  than with a-nother lyne that goth fro south to north. Than is it
  devided in smale partiez of azimutz, as est, and est by southe,
  whereas is the firste azimut above the est lyne; and so forth, fro
  partie to partie, til that thou come agayn un-to the est lyne.         15
  Thus maistow understond also the senith of any sterre, in which
  partie he ryseth, &c. And for the more declaracion, lo here
  the figure.

  32. TO KNOWE IN WHICH PARTIE OF THE FIRMAMENT IS THE CONIUNCCIOUN.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM IN QUA PARTE FIRMAMENTI SUNT CONIUNCCIONES SOLIS ET
      LUNE.]

  Considere the tyme of the coniunccion by thy kalender, as thus;
  lok how many houres thilke coniunccion is fro the midday of the
  day precedent, as sheweth by the canoun of thy kalender. Rikne
  thanne thilke nombre of houres in the bordure of thyn Astrolabie,
  as thou art wont to do in knowing of the houres of the day or of        5
  the night; and ley thy label over the degree of the sonne; and
  thanne wol the point of thy label sitte up-on the hour of the
      coniunccion.
  Loke thanne in which azimut the degree of thy sonne
  sitteth, and in that partie of the firmament is the coniunccioun.
  And for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  33. TO KNOWE THE SENITH OF THE ALTITUDE OF THE SONNE, &C.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM SIGNA DE ALTITUDINE SOLIS.]

  This is no more to seyn but any tyme of the day tak the altitude
  of the sonne; and by the azimut in which he stondeth, maystou
  seen in which partie of the firmament he is. And in the same
  wyse maystou seen, by the night, of any sterre, whether the
  sterre sitte est or west or north, or any partie by-twene, after the    5
  name of the azimut in which is the sterre. And for the more
  declaracioun, lo here the figure.

  34. TO KNOWE SOTHLY THE DEGREE OF THE LONGITUDE OF THE MONE, OR OF ANY
      PLANETE THAT HATH NO LATITUDE FOR THE TYME FRO THE ECLIPTIK LYNE.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM VERACITER GRADUM DE LONGITUDINE LUNE, VEL ALICUIUS
      PLANETE QUI NON HABET LONGITUDINEM PRO TEMPORE CAUSANTO LINEA
      ECLIPTICA.]

  Tak the altitude of the mone, and rikne thyn altitude up among
  thyne almikanteras on which syde that the mone stande; and set
  there a prikke. Tak thenne anon-right, up-on the mones syde,
  the altitude of any sterre fix which that thou knowest, and set his
  centre up-on his altitude among thyn almikanteras ther the sterre       5
  is founde. Waite thanne which degree of the zodiak toucheth the
  prikke of the altitude of the mone, and tak ther the degree in
  which the mone standeth. This conclusioun is verrey soth, yif
  the sterres in thyn Astrolabie stonden after the trowthe; of
  comune, tretis of Astrolabie ne make non excepcioun whether the        10
  mone have latitude, or non; ne on whether syde of the mone the
  altitude of the sterre fix be taken. And _nota_, that yif the mone
  shewe himself by light of day, than maystow wyrke this same
  conclusioun by the sonne, as wel as by the fix sterre. And for the
  more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.                                 15

  35. THIS IS THE WORKINGE OF THE CONCLUSIOUN, TO KNOWE YIF THAT ANY
      PLANETE BE DIRECTE OR RETROGRADE.

  [HEC CONCLUSIO OPERATUR AD COGNOSCENDUM SI ALIQUA PLANETA SIT DIRECTA VEL
      RETROGRADA.]

  Tak the altitude of any sterre that is cleped a planete, and note
  it wel. And tak eek anon the altitude of any sterre fix that thou
  knowest, and note it wel also. Come thanne agayn the thridde or
  the ferthe night next folwing; for thanne shaltow aperceyve wel the
  moeving of a planete, whether so he moeve forthward or bakward.         5
  Awaite wel thanne whan that thy sterre fix is in the same altitude that
  she was whan thou toke hir firste altitude; and tak than eftsones
  the altitude of the forseide planete, and note it wel. For trust
  wel, yif so be that the planete be on the right syde of the meridional
  lyne, so that his seconde altitude be lasse than his firste altitude   10
  was, thanne is the planete directe. And yif he be on the west
  syde in that condicion, thanne is he retrograd. And yif so be
  that this planete be up-on the est syde whan his altitude is taken,
  so that his secounde altitude be more than his firste altitude,
  thanne is he retrograde, and yif he be on the west syde, than is he    15
  directe. But the contrarie of thise parties is of the cours of the
  mone; for sothly, the mone moeveth the contrarie from othere
  planetes as in hir episicle, but in non other manere. And for
  the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  36. THE CONCLUSIOUNS OF EQUACIOUNS OF HOUSES, AFTER THE ASTROLABIE, &C.

  [CONCLUSIO DE EQUACIONE DOMORUM.]

  Set the by-ginning of the degree that assendeth up-on the ende
  of the 8 houre inequal; thanne wol the by-ginning of the 2 hous
  sitte up-on the lyne of midnight. Remove thanne the degree that
  assendeth, and set him on the ende of the 10 hour inequal; and
  thanne wol the byginning of the 3 hous sitte up-on the midnight         5
  lyne. Bring up agayn the same degree that assendeth first, and
  set him up-on the orisonte; and thanne wol the be-ginning of the
  4 hous sitte up-on the lyne of midnight. Tak thanne the nadir of
  the degree that first assendeth, and set him on the ende of the 2
  houre inequal; and thanne wol the by-ginning of the 5 hous sitte       10
  up-on the lyne of midnight; set thanne the nadir of the assendent
  on the ende of the 4 houre, than wol the byginning of the 6 house
  sitte on the midnight lyne. The byginning of the 7 hous is nadir
  of the assendent, and the byginning of the 8 hous is nadir of the
  2; and the by-ginning of the 9 hous is nadir of the 3; and the         15
  by-ginning of the 10 hous is the nadir of the 4; and the byginning
  of the 11 hous is nadir of the 5; and the byginning of the 12 hous
  is nadir of the 6. And for the more declaracion, lo here the
  figure.

  37. A-NOTHER MANERE OF EQUACIOUNS OF HOUSES BY THE ASTROLABIE.

  [DE ALIQUA FORMA EQUACIONIS DOMORUM SECUNDUM ASTROLABIUM.]

  Tak thyn assendent, and thanne hastow thy 4 angles; for wel
  thou wost that the opposit of thyn assendent, that is to seyn, thy
  by-ginning of the 7 hous, sit up-on the west orizonte; and the
  byginning of the 10 hous sit up-on the lyne meridional; and his
  opposit up-on the lyne of midnight. Thanne ley thy label over           5
  the degree that assendeth, and rekne fro the point of thy label
  alle the degrees in the bordure, til thou come to the meridional
  lyne; and departe alle thilke degrees in 3 evene parties, and take
  the evene equacion of 3; for ley thy label over everich of 3 parties,
  and than maistow see by thy label in which degree of the zodiak is     10
  the by-ginning of everich of thise same houses fro the assendent:
  that is to seyn, the beginning of the 12 house next above thyn
  assendent; and thanne the beginning of the 11 house; and
  thanne the 10, up-on the meridional lyne; as I first seide. The
  same wyse wirke thou fro the assendent doun to the lyne of             15
  midnight; and thanne thus hastow other 3 houses, that is to seyn,
  the byginning of the 2, and the 3, and the 4 houses; thanne is
  the nadir of thise 3 houses the by-ginning of the 3 houses that
  folwen. And for the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  38. TO FINDE THE LYNE MERYDIONAL TO DWELLE FIX IN ANY CERTEIN PLACE.

  [AD INVENIENDUM LINEAM MERIDIONALEM PER SUBTILES OPERACIONES.]

  Tak a rond plate of metal; for warping, the brodere the bettre;
  and make ther-upon a iust compas, a lite with-in the bordure; and
  ley this ronde plate up-on an evene grond, or on an evene ston, or
  on an evene stok fix in the gronde; and ley it even by a level.
  And in centre of the compas stike an evene pin or a wyr upright;        5
  the smallere the betere. Set thy pin by a plom-rewle evene
  upright; and let this pin be no lengere than a quarter of the
  diametre of thy compas, fro the centre. And waite bisily, aboute
  10 or 11 of the clokke and whan the sonne shyneth, whan the
  shadwe of the pin entreth any-thing with-in the cercle of thy plate    10
  an heer-mele, and mark ther a prikke with inke. Abyde thanne
  stille waiting on the sonne after 1 of the clokke, til that the
  schadwe of the wyr or of the pin passe ony-thing out of the cercle
  of the compas, be it never so lyte; and set ther a-nother prikke
  of inke. Take than a compas, and mesure evene the middel               15
  by-twixe bothe prikkes; and set ther a prikke. Take thanne
  a rewle, and draw a stryke, evene a-lyne fro the pin un-to the
  middel prikke; and tak ther thy lyne meridional for evere-mo, as
  in that same place. And yif thow drawe a cros-lyne over-thwart
  the compas, iustly over the lyne meridional, than hastow est and       20
  west and south; and, par consequence, than the nadir of the
  south lyne is the north lyne. And for more declaracioun, lo here
  thy figure.

  39. DESCRIPCION OF THE MERIDIONAL LYNE, OF LONGITUDES, AND LATITUDES OF
      CITEES AND TOWNES FROM ON TO A-NOTHER OF CLYMATZ.

  This lyne meridional is but a maner descripcion of lyne
  imagined, that passeth upon the poles of this world and by
  the senith of oure heved. And hit is y-cleped the lyne meridional;
  for in what place that any maner man is at any tyme of the yeer,
  whan that the sonne by moeving of the firmament cometh to his           5
  verrey meridian place, than is hit verrey midday, that we clepen
  oure noon, as to thilke man; and therfore is it cleped the lyne of
  midday. And _nota_, for evermo, of 2 citees or of 2 tounes, of
  whiche that o toun aprocheth more toward the est than doth
  that other toun, truste wel that thilke tounes ban diverse meridians.  10
  _Nota_ also, that the arch of the equinoxial, that is conteyned
  or bounded by-twixe the 2 meridians, is cleped the longitude
  of the toun. And yif so be that two tounes have y-lyke
  meridian, or oon meridian, than is the distance of hem bothe y-lyke
  fer fro the est; and the contrarie. And in this manere they            15
  chaunge nat her meridian, but sothly they chaungen her almikanteras;
  for the enhausing of the pool and the distance of the
  sonne. The longitude of a clymat is a lyne imagined fro est to
  west, y-lyke distant by-twene them alle. The latitude of a clymat
  is a lyne imagined from north to south the space of the erthe,         20
  fro the byginning of the firste clymat unto the verrey ende of
  the same climat, evene directe agayns the pole artik. Thus seyn
  some auctours; and somme of hem seyn that yif men clepen the
  latitude, thay mene the arch meridian that is contiened or intercept
  by-twixe the senith and the equinoxial. Thanne sey they that           25
  the distaunce fro the equinoxial unto the ende of a clymat,
  evene agayns the pole artyk, is the latitude of a clymat for sothe.
  And for more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.

  40. TO KNOWE WITH WHICH DEGREE OF THE ZODIAK THAT ANY PLANETE ASSENDITH
      ON THE ORISONTE, WHETHER SO THAT HIS LATITUDE BE NORTH OR SOUTH.

  Knowe by thyn almenak the degree of the ecliptik of any signe
  in which that the planete is rekned for to be, and that is cleped
  the degree of his longitude; and knowe also the degree of his
  latitude fro the ecliptik, north or south. And by thise samples
  folwinge in special, maystow wirke for sothe in every signe of the      5
  zodiak. The degree of the longitude, par aventure, of Venus or
  of another planete, was 6 of Capricorne, and the latitude of him
  was northward 2 degrees fro the ecliptik lyne. I tok a subtil
  compas, and cleped that oon poynt of my compas A, and that
  other poynt F. Than tok I the point of A, and set it in the            10
  ecliptik lyne evene in my zodiak, in the degree of the longitude
  of Venus, that is to seyn, in the 6 degree of Capricorne; and
  thanne sette I the point of F upward in the same signe, bycause
  that the latitude was north, up-on the latitude of Venus, that is to
  seyn, in the 6 degree fro the heved of Capricorne; and thus have       15
  I 2 degrees by-twixe my two prikkes. Than leide I doun softely
  my compas, and sette the degree of the longitude up-on the
  orisonte; tho tok I and wexede my label in maner of a peyre
  tables to resceyve distinctly the prikkes of my compas. Tho tok
  I this forseide label, and leide it fix over the degree of my          20
  longitude; tho tok I up my compas, and sette the point of A in
  the wex on my label, as evene as I coude gesse over the ecliptik
  lyne, in the ende of the longitude; and sette the point of F
  endlang in my label up-on the space of the latitude, inwarde and
  over the zodiak, that is to seyn, north-ward fro the ecliptik. Than    25
  leide I doun my compas, and lokede wel in the wey upon the
  prikke of A and of F; tho turned I my riet til that the prikke of
  F sat up-on the orisonte; than saw I wel that the body of Venus,
  in hir latitude of 2 degrees septentrionalis, assended, in the ende
  of the 6 degree, in the heved of Capricorne. And _nota_, that in the   30
  same maner maistow wirke with any latitude septentrional in alle
  signes; but sothly the latitude meridional of a planete in Capricorne
  may not be take, by-cause of the litel space by-twixe the ecliptik
  and the bordure of the Astrolabie; but sothly, in alle other signes
  it may.                                                                35

  Also the degree, par aventure, of Iuppiter or of a-nother planete,
  was in the first degree of Pisces in longitude, and his latitude was
  3 degrees meridional; tho tok I the point of A, and sette it in
  the firste degree of Pisces on the ecliptik, and thanne sette I the
  point of F dounward in the same signe, by-cause that the latitude      40
  was south 3 degrees, that is to seyn, fro the heved of Pisces; and
  thus have I 3 degrees by-twixe bothe prikkes; thanne sette I the
  degree of the longitude up-on the orisonte. Tho tok I my label,
  and leide it fix upon the degree of the longitude; tho sette I the
  point of A on my label, evene over the ecliptik lyne, in the ende      45
  evene of the degree of the longitude, and sette the point of F
  endlang in my label the space of 3 degrees of the latitude fro the
  zodiak, this is to seyn, southward fro the ecliptik, toward the
  bordure; and turned my riet til the prikke of F sat up-on the
  orisonte; thanne saw I wel that the body of Iuppiter, in his           50
  latitude of 3 degrees meridional, ascended with 14 degrees of Pisces
  _in horoscopo_. And in this maner maistow wirke with any latitude
  meridional, as I first seide, save in Capricorne. And yif thou wolt
  pleye this craft with the arysing of the mone, loke thou rekne wel
  hir cours houre by houre; for she ne dwelleth nat in a degree of       55
  hir longitude but a litel whyle, as thou wel knowest; but natheles,
  yif thou rekne hir verreye moeving by thy tables houre after houre,
  [thou shall do wel y-now].

SUPPLEMENTARY PROPOSITIONS.


  41. UMBRA RECTA.

  Yif it so be that thou wilt werke by _umbra recta_, and thou may
  come to the bas of the toure, in this maner thou schalt werke.
  Tak the altitude of the tour by bothe holes, so that thy rewle ligge
  even in a poynt. Ensample as thus: I see him thorw at the
  poynt of 4; than mete I the space be-tween me and the tour, and I       5
  finde it 20 feet; than be-holde I how 4 is to 12, right so is the space
  betwixe thee and the tour to the altitude of the tour. For 4 is the
  thridde part of 12, so is the space be-tween thee and the tour the
  thridde part of the altitude of the tour; than thryes 20 feet is the
  heyghte of the tour, with adding of thyn owne persone to thyn          10
  eye. And this rewle is so general in _umbra recta_, fro the poynt of
  oon to 12. And yif thy rewle falle upon 5, than is 5 12-partyes
  of the heyght the space be-tween thee and the toure; with adding
  of thyn owne heyght.

  42. UMBRA VERSA.

  Another maner of werkinge, by _vmbra versa._ Yif so be that
  thou may nat come to the bas of the tour, I see him thorw the
  nombre of 1; I sette ther a prikke at my fote; than go I neer to
  the tour, and I see him thorw at the poynt of 2, and there I sette
  a-nother prikke; and I beholde how 1 hath him to 12, and ther           5
  finde I that it hath him twelfe sythes; than beholde I how 2
  hath him to 12, and thou shalt finde it sexe sythes; than thou shalt
  finde that as 12 above 6 is the numbre of 6, right so is the space
  between thy two prikkes the space of 6 tymes thyn altitude. And
  note, that at the ferste altitude of 1, thou settest a prikke; and     10
  afterward, whan thou seest him at 2, ther thou settest an-other
  prikke; than thou findest between two prikkys 60 feet; than thou
  shalt finde that 10 is the 6-party of 60. And then is 10 feet the
  altitude of the tour. For other poyntis, yif it fille in _umbra versa_,
  as thus: I sette caas it fill upon 2, and at the secunde upon 3;       15
  than schalt thou finde that 2 is 6 partyes of 12; and 3 is 4 partyes
  of 12; than passeth 6 4, by nombre of 2; so is the space between
  two prikkes twyes the heyghte of the tour. And yif the differens
  were thryes, than shulde it be three tymes; and thus mayst thou
  werke fro 2 to 12; and yif it be 4, 4 tymes; or 5, 5 tymes; _et sic    20
  de ceteris_.

  43. UMBRA RECTA.

  An-other maner of wyrking be _umbra recta_. Yif it so be that
  thou mayst nat come to the baas of the tour, in this maner thou
  schalt werke. Sette thy rewle upon 1 till thou see the altitude,
  and sette at thy foot a prikke. Than sette thy rewle upon 2, and
  beholde what is the differense be-tween 1 and 2, and thou shalt         5
  finde that it is 1. Than mete the space be-tween two prikkes, and
  that is the 12 partie of the altitude of the tour. And yif ther were
  2, it were the 6 partye; and yif ther were 3, the 4 partye; _et sic
  deinceps_. And note, yif it were 5, it were the 5 party of 12; and
  7, 7 party of 12; and note, at the altitude of thy conclusioun,        10
  adde the stature of thyn heyghte to thyn eye.

  44. ANOTHER MANER CONCLUSION, TO KNOWE THE MENE MOTE AND THE ARGUMENTIS
      OF ANY PLANETE. TO KNOW THE MENE MOTE AND THE ARGUMENTIS OF EVERY
      PLANETE FRO YERE TO YERE, FROM DAY TO DAY, FROM HOURE TO HOURE, AND
      FROM SMALE FRACCIONIS INFINITE.

  [AD COGNOSCENDUM MEDIOS MOTUS ET ARGUMENTA DE HORA IN HORAM CUIUSLIBET
      PLANETE, DE ANNO IN ANNUM, DE DIE IN DIEM.]

  In this maner shall thou worche: consider thy rote first, the
  whiche is made the beginning of the tables fro the yere of oure
  lord 1397, and entere hit in-to thy slate for the laste meridie of
  December; and than consider the yere of oure lord, what is the
  date, and be-hold whether thy date be more or lasse than the yere       5
  1397. And yf hit so be that hit be more, loke how many yeres
  hit passeth, and with so many entere into thy tables in the first
  lyne ther-as is writen _anni collecti et expansi_. And loke where the
  same planet is writen in the hede of thy table, and than loke
  what thou findest in directe of the same yere of oure lord whiche      10
  is passid, be hit 8, or 9, or 10, or what nombre that evere it be, til
  the tyme that thou come to 20, or 40, or 60. And that thou
  findest in directe wryte in thy slate under thy rote, and adde hit
  to-geder, and that is thy mene mote, for the laste meridian of the
  December, for the same yere whiche that thou hast purposed.            15
  And if hit so be that hit passe 20, consider wel that fro 1 to 20
  ben _anni expansi_, and fro 20 to 3000 ben _anni collecti_; and if thy
  nombere passe 20, than take that thou findest in directe of 20, and
  if hit be more, as 6 or 18, than take that thou findest in directe
  there-of, that is to sayen, signes, degrees, minutes, and secoundes,   20
  and adde to-gedere un-to thy rote; and thus to make rotes; and
  note, that if hit so be that the yere of oure lord be lasse than the
  rote, whiche is the yere of oure lord 1397, than shalt thou wryte in
  the same wyse furst thy rote in thy slate, and after entere in-to thy
  table in the same yere that be lasse, as I taught be-fore; and         25
  than consider how many signes, degrees, minutes, and secoundes
  thyn entringe conteyneth. And so be that ther be 2 entrees,
  than adde hem togeder, and after with-drawe hem from the
  rote, the yere of oure lord 1397; and the residue that leveth
  is thy mene mote fro the laste meridie of December, the whiche         30
  thou hast purposed; and if hit so be that thou wolt weten thy
  mene mote for any day, or for any fraccioun of day, in this
  maner thou shalt worche. Make thy rote fro the laste day
  of Decembere in the maner as I have taught, and afterward
  behold how many monethis, dayes, and houres ben passid from            35
  the meridie of Decembere, and with that entere with the laste
  moneth that is ful passed, and take that thou findest in directe
  of him, and wryte hit in thy slate; and entere with as mony
  dayes as be more, and wryte that thou findest in directe of the
  same planete that thou worchest for; and in the same wyse in           40
  the table of houres, for houres that ben passed, and adde alle these
  to thy rote; and the residue is the mene mote for the same day
  and the same houre.

  45. ANOTHER MANERE TO KNOWE THE MENE MOTE.

  Whan thou wolt make the mene mote of eny planete to be by
  Arsechieles tables, take thy rote, the whiche is for the yere of oure
  lord 1397; and if so be that thy yere be passid the date, wryte
  that date, and than wryte the nombere of the yeres. Than withdrawe
  the yeres out of the yeres that ben passed that rote.                   5
  Ensampul as thus: the yere of oure lord 1400, I wolde witen,
  precise, my rote; than wroot I furst 1400. And under that
  nombere I wrote a 1397; than withdraw I the laste nombere
  out of that, and than fond I the residue was 3 yere; I wiste
  that 3 yere was passed fro the rote, the whiche was writen in          10
  my tables. Than after-ward soghte I in my tables the _annis
  collectis et expansis_, and amonge myn expanse yeres fond I
  3 yeer. Than tok I alle the signes, degrees, and minutes, that
  I fond directe under the same planete that I wroghte for, and
  wroot so many signes, degrees, and minutes in my slate, and            15
  afterward added I to signes, degrees, minutes, and secoundes,
  the whiche I fond in my rote the yere of oure lord 1397;
  and kepte the residue; and than had I the mene mote for
  the laste day of Decembere. And if thou woldest wete the
  mene mote of any planete in March, Aprile, or May, other               20

  46. FOR TO KNOWE AT WHAT HOURE OF THE DAY, OR OF THE NIGHT, SHAL BE FLODE
      OR EBBE.

  First wite thou certeinly, how that haven stondeth, that thou
  list to werke for; that is to say in whiche place of the firmament
  the mone being, maketh fulle see. Than awayte thou redily in
  what degree of the zodiak that the mone at that tyme is inne.
  Bringe furth than the labelle, and set the point therof in that         5
  same cost that the mone maketh flode, and set thou there the
  degree of the mone according with the egge of the label. Than
  afterward awayte where is than the degree of the sonne, at that
  tyme. Remeve thou than the label fro the mone, and bringe and
  sette it iustly upon the degree of the sonne. And the point of         10
  the label shal than declare to thee, at what houre of the day or of
  the night shal be flode. And there also maist thou wite by the
  same point of the label, whether it be, at that same tyme, flode or
  ebbe, or half flode, or quarter flode, or ebbe, or half or quarter
  ebbe; or ellis at what houre it was last, or shal be next by night or  15
  by day, thou than shalt esely knowe, &c. Furthermore, if it so be
  that thou happe to worke for this matere aboute the tyme of the
  coniunccioun, bringe furthe the degree of the mone with the
  labelle to that coste as it is before seyd. But than thou shalt
  understonde that thou may not bringe furthe the label fro the          20
  degree of the mone as thou dide before; for-why the sonne is
  than in the same degree with the mone. And so thou may at that
  tyme by the point of the labelle unremeved knowe the houre of
  the flode or of the ebbe, as it is before seyd, &c. And evermore
  as thou findest the mone passe fro the sonne, so remeve thou the       25
  labelle than fro the degree of the mone, and bringe it to the
  degree of the sonne. And worke thou than as thou dide before,
  &c. Or elles knowe thou what houre it is that thou art inne, by
  thyn instrument. Than bringe thou furth fro thennes the labelle
  and ley it upon the degree of the mone, and therby may thou wite       30
  also whan it was flode, or whan it wol be next, be it night or
  day; &c.

  [_The following sections are spurious; they are numbered so as to shew
      what propositions they repeat._]

  41_a_. UMBRA RECTA.

  Yif thy rewle falle upon the 8 poynt on right schadwe, than make
  thy figure of 8; than loke how moche space of feet is be-tween thee
  and the tour, and multiplye that be 12, and whan thou hast multiplied
  it, than divyde it be the same nombre of 8, and kepe the residue; and
  adde therto up to thyn eye to the residue, and that shal be the verry   5
  heyght of the tour. And thus mayst thou werke on the same wyse, fro
  1 to 12.

  41_b_. UMBRA RECTA.

  An-other maner of werking upon the same syde. Loke upon which
  poynt thy rewle falleth whan thou seest the top of the tour thorow two
  litil holes; and mete than the space fro thy foot to the baas of the
  tour; and right as the nombre of thy poynt hath him-self to 12, right
  so the mesure be-tween thee and the tour hath him-self to the heighte   5
  of the same tour. Ensample: I sette caas thy rewle falle upon 8;
  than is 8 two-thrid partyes of 12; so the space is the two-thrid partyes
  of the tour.

  42_a_. UMBRA VERSA.

  To knowe the heyghth by thy poyntes of _umbra versa_. Yif thy
  rewle falle upon 3, whan thou seest the top of the tour, set a prikke
  there-as thy foot stont; and go ner til thou mayst see the same top at
  the poynt of 4, and sette ther another lyk prikke. Than mete how
  many foot ben be-tween the two prikkes, and adde the lengthe up to      5
  thyn eye ther-to; and that shal be the heyght of the tour. And note,
  that 3 is [the] fourthe party of 12, and 4 is the thridde party of 12.
  Now passeth 4 the nombre of 3 be the distaunce of 1; therfore the
  same space, with thyn heyght to thyn eye, is the heyght of the tour.
  And yif it so be that ther be 2 or 3 distaunce in the nombres, so
      shulde                                                             10
  the mesures be-tween the prikkes be twyes or thryes the heyghte of
  the tour.

  43_a_. AD COGNOSCENDUM ALTITUDINEM ALICUIUS REI PER UMBRAM RECTAM.

  To knowe the heyghte of thinges, yif thou mayst nat come to the
  bas of a thing. Sette thy rewle upon what thou wilt, so that thou may
  see the top of the thing thorw the two holes, and make a marke ther
  thy foot standeth; and go neer or forther, til thou mayst see thorw
  another poynt, and marke ther a-nother marke. And loke than what        5
  is the differense be-twen the two poyntes in the scale; and right as
  that difference hath him to 12, right so the space be-tween thee and
  the two markes hath him to the heyghte of the thing. Ensample: I
  set caas thou seest it thorw a poynt of 4; after, at the poynt of 3.
  Now passeth the nombre of 4 the nombre of 3 be the difference of 1;    10
  and right as this difference 1 hath him-self to 12, right so the mesure
  be-tween the two markes hath him to the heyghte of the thing, putting
  to the heyghte of thy-self to thyn eye; and thus mayst thou werke
  fro 1 to 12.

  42_b_. PER UMBRAM VERSAM.

  Furthermore, yif thou wilt knowe in _umbra versa_, by the craft of
  _umbra recta_, I suppose thou take the altitude at the poynt of 4, and
  makest a marke; and thou goost neer til thou hast it at the poynt of
  3, and than makest thou ther a-nother mark. Than muste thou
  devyde 144 by eche of the poyntes be-fornseyd, as thus: yif thou        5
  devyde 144 be 4, and the nombre that cometh ther-of schal be 36, and
  yif thou devyde 144 be 3, and the nombre that cometh ther-of schal be
  48, thanne loke what is the difference be-tween 36 and 48, and ther
  shalt thou fynde 12; and right as 12 hath him to 12, right so the space
  be-tween two prikkes hath him to the altitude of the thing.            10




COMMENTARY ("FOOTNOTES").

Little Lewis my son, I perceive that thou wouldst learn the Conclusions of
the Astrolabe; wherefore I have given thee an instrument constructed for
the latitude of Oxford, and purpose to teach thee _some_ of these
conclusions. I say _some_, for three reasons; (1) because some of them are
unknown in this land; (2) because some are uncertain; or else (3) are too
hard. This treatise, divided into five parts, I write for thee in English,
just as Greeks, Arabians, Jews, and Romans were accustomed to write such
things in their own tongue. I pray all to excuse my shortcomings; and thou,
Lewis, shouldst thank me if I teach thee as much in English as most common
treatises can do in Latin. I have done no more than compile from old
writers on the subject, and I have translated it into English solely for
thine instruction; and with this sword shall I slay envy.

The _first_ part gives a description of the instrument itself.

The _second_ teaches the practical working of it.

The _third_ shall contain tables of latitudes and longitudes of fixed
stars, declinations of the sun, and the longitudes of certain towns.

The _fourth_ shall shew the motions of the heavenly bodies, and especially
of the moon.

The _fifth_ shall teach a great part of the general rules of astronomical
theory.



Here begins the _first_ part; i.e. the description of the Astrolabe itself.

1. _The Ring._ See figs. 1 and 2. The Latin name is _Armilla suspensoria_;
the Arabic name is spelt _alhahuacia_ in MS. Camb. Univ. Ii. 3. 3, but
Stöffler says it is _Alanthica_, _Alphantia_, or _Abalhantica_. For the
meaning of 'rewle,' see § 13.

2. _The Turet._ This answers nearly to what we call an _eye_ or a _swivel_.
The metal plate, or loop, to which it is fastened, or in which it turns, is
called in Latin _Ansa_ or _Armilla Reflexa_, in Arabic _Alhabos_.

3. _The Moder._ In Latin, _Mater_ or _Rotula_. This forms the body of the
instrument, the back of which is shewn in fig. 1, the front in fig. 2. The
'large hole' is the wide depression sunk in the front of it, into which the
various discs are dropped. In the figure, the 'Rete' is shewn fitted into
it.

4. See fig. 1; Chaucer describes the 'bak-half' of the instrument first.
The centre of the 'large hole amydde' is the centre of the instrument,
where a smaller hole is pierced completely through. The _Southe lyne_
(marked _Meridies_ in figs. 1 and 2) is also called _Linea Meridiei;_ the
_North lyne_ is also named _Linea Mediæ Noctis_.

5. The _Est lyne_ is marked with the word _Oriens;_ the _West lyne_, with
_Occidens_.

6. The rule is the same as in heraldry, the _right_ or _dexter_ side being
towards the spectator's left.

7. As the 360 degrees answer to 24 hours of time, 15° answer to an hour,
and 5° to twenty minutes, or a _Mile-way_, as it is the average time for
walking a mile. So also 1° answers to 4 minutes of time. See the two
outermost circles in fig. 1, and the divisions of the 'border' in fig. 2.

8. See the third and fourth circles (reckoning inwards) in fig. 1.

9. See the fifth and sixth circles in fig. 1.

10. See the seventh, eighth, and ninth circles in fig. 1. The names of the
months are all Roman. The month formerly called _Quinctilis_ was first
called _Julius_ in B.C. 44; that called _Sextilis_ was named _Augustus_ in
B.C. 27. It is a mistake to say that Julius and Augustus made the
alterations spoken of in the text; what Julius Cæsar really did, was to add
2 days to the months of January, August (Sextilis), and December, and 1 day
to April, June, September, and November. February never had more than 28
days till he introduced bissextile years.

11. See the two inmost circles in fig. 1. The names given are adopted from
a comparison of the figures in the Cambridge University and Trinity MSS.,
neither of which are quite correct. The letters of the 'Abc.' are what we
now call the Sunday letters. The festivals marked are those of St. Paul
(Jan. 25), The Purification (Feb. 2), The Annunciation (Mar. 25), The
Invention of the Holy Cross (May 3), St. John the Baptist (June 24), St.
James (July 25), St. Lawrence (Aug. 10), The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin
(Sept. 8), St. Luke (Oct. 18), St. Martin of Tours (Nov. 11), and St.
Thomas (Dec. 21).

12. The 'scale' is in Latin _Quadrans_, or _Scala Altimetra_. It is certain
that Chaucer has here made a slip, which cannot be fairly laid to the
charge of the scribes, as the MSS. agree in transposing _versa_ and
_recta_. The side-parts of the scale are called _Umbra versa_, the lower
part _Umbra recta_ or _extensa_. This will appear more clearly at the end
of Part II. (I here give a _corrected text_.)

13. See fig. 3, Plate III. Each plate turns on a hinge, just like the
'sights' of a gun. One is drawn flat down, the other partly elevated. Each
plate (_tabella vel pinnula_) has two holes, the smaller one being the
lower. This _Rewle_ is named in Arabic _Alhidada_ or _Al´id[=a]da;_ in
Latin _Verticulum_, from its turning easily on the centre; in Greek
_Dioptra_, as carrying the sights. The straight edge, passing through the
centre, is called the _Linea Fiduciæ_. It is pierced by a hole in the
centre, of the same size as that in the _Mother_.

14. See fig. 4, Plate III. The _Pin_ is also called _Axis_ or _Clavus_, in
Latin-Arabic _Alchitot;_ it occupies the position of the Arctic or North
Pole, passing through the centre of the plates that are required to turn
round it. The _Wedge_ is called _cuneus_, or _equus restringens_, in Arabic
_Alfaras_ or the horse, because it was sometimes cut into the shape of a
horse, as shewn in fig. 7, Plate IV, which is copied from MS. Univ. Camb.
Ii. 3. 3.

15. See fig. 2, Plate II. In the figure, the cross-lines are partly hidden
by the _Rete_, which is separate and removable, and revolves within the
border.

16. The _Border_ was also called _Margilabrum_, _Margolabrum_, or _Limbus_.
It is marked (as explained) with hour-letters and degrees. Each degree
contains 4 minutes _of time_, and each of these minutes contains 60 seconds
_of time_.

17. We may place under the _Rete_ any plates we please. If only the
_Mother_ be under it, without any plate, we may suppose the _Mother_ marked
as in fig. 2. The plate or disc (_tympanum_) which was usually dropped in
under the _Rete_ is that shewn in fig. 5, Plate III, and which Chaucer now
describes. Any number of these, marked differently for different latitudes,
could be provided for the Astrolabe. The greatest declination of the sun
measures the obliquity of the ecliptic, the true value of which is slightly
variable, but was about 23° 31' in Chaucer's time, and about 23° 40' in the
time of Ptolemy, who certainly assigns to it too large a value. The value
of it must be known before the three circles can be drawn. The method of
finding their relative magnitudes is very simple. Let ABCD (fig. 8, Pl. IV)
be the tropic of Capricorn, BO the South line, OC the West line. Make the
angle EOB equal to the obliquity (say 23½°), and join EA, meeting BO in F.
Then OF is the radius of the Equatorial circle, and if GH be drawn parallel
to EF, OH is the radius of the Tropic of Cancer. In the phrase _angulus
primi motus_, _angulus_ must be taken to mean angular motion. The 'first
moving' (_primus motus_) has its name of 'moving' (_motus_) from its
denoting motion due to the _primum mobile_ or 'first moveable.' This
_primum mobile_ (usually considered as the _ninth_ sphere) causes the
rotation of the _eighth_ sphere, or _sphæra stellarum fixarum_. See the
fig. in MS. Camb. Univ. Ii. 3. 3 (copied in fig. 10, Pl. V). Some authors
make 12 heavens, viz. those of the 7 planets, the _firmamentum_ (_stellarum
fixarum_), the _nonum coelum_, _decimum coelum_, _primum mobile_, and
_coelum empyræum_.

18. See fig. 5, Pl. III. This is made upon the alt-azimuth system, and the
plates are marked according to the latitude. The circles, called in Latin
_circuli progressionum_, in Arabic _Almucantar[=a]t_, are circles of
altitude, the largest imperfect one representing the horizon (_horizon
obliquus_), and the central dot being the zenith, or pole of the horizon.
In my figure, they are 'compounded by' 5 and 5, but Chaucer's shewed every
second degree, i.e. it possessed 45 such circles. For the method of drawing
them, see Stöffler, leaf 5, back.

19. Some Astrolabes shew 18 of these azimuthal circles, as in my figure
(fig. 5, Pl. III). See Stöffler, leaf 13, where will be found also the
rules for drawing them.

20. If accurately drawn, these _embelife_ or oblique lines should divide
the portions of the three circles below the _horizon obliquus_ into twelve
equal parts. Thus each arc is determined by having to pass through three
known points. They are called _arcus horarum inequalium_, as they shew the
'houres inequales.'

21. In fig. 2, Pl. II, the _Rete_ is shewn as it appears when dropped into
the depression in the front of the instrument. The shape of it varied much,
and another drawing of one (copied from Camb. Univ. MS. Ii. 3. 3, fol. 66
_b_) is given in fig. 9, Pl. IV. The positions of the stars are marked by
the extreme points of the metal tongues. Fig. 2 is taken from the figures
in the Cambridge MSS., but the positions of the stars have been corrected
by the list of latitudes and longitudes given by Stöffler, whom I have
followed, not because he is _correct_, but because he probably represents
their positions as they were supposed to be in Chaucer's time very nearly
indeed. There was not room to inscribe the names of all the stars on the
_Rete_, and to have written them _on the plate below_ would have conveyed a
false impression. A list of the stars marked in fig. 2 is given in the note
to § 21, l. 4. The Ecliptic is the circle which crosses the Equinoctial at
its East and West points (fig. 2). In Chaucer's description of the zodiac,
carefully note the distinction between the Zodiac of the Astrolabe and the
Zodiac of Heaven. The former is only _six_ degrees broad, and shews only
the northern half of the heavenly zodiac, the breadth of which is
_imagined_ to be 12 degrees. Chaucer's zodiac only shewed _every other_
degree in the divisions round its border. This border is divided by help of
a table of right ascensions of the various degrees of the ecliptic, which
is by no means easily done. See Note on l. 4 of this section. I may add
that the _Rete_ is also called _Aranea_ or _Volvellum_; in Arabic,
_Al´ancab[=u]t_ (the spider).

22. _The Label._ See fig. 6, Pl. III. The _label_ is more usually used on
the _front_ of the instrument, where the _Rete_ and other plates revolve.
The _rule_ is used on the _back_, for taking altitudes by help of the
scale.

23. _The Almury_; called also _denticulus_, _ostensor_, or 'calculer.' In
fig. 2, it may be seen that the edge of the _Rete_ is cut away near the
head of Capricorn, leaving only a small pointed projecting tongue, which is
the almury or denticle, or (as we should now say) pointer. As the _Rete_
revolves, it points to the different degrees of the border. See also fig.
9, where the almury is plainly marked.

Part II, § 1. [The Latin headings to the propositions are taken from the
MS. in St. John's College, Cambridge.] See fig. 1. Any straight edge laid
across from the centre will shew this at once. Chaucer, reckoning by the
old style, differs from us by about eight days. The first degree of Aries,
which in his time answered to the 12th of March, now vibrates between the
20th and 21st of that month. This difference of eight days must be
carefully borne in mind in calculating Chaucer's dates.

2. Here 'thy left side' means the left side of thine own body, and
therefore the right or Eastern edge of the Astrolabe. In taking the
altitude of the sun, the rays are allowed to shine through the holes; but
the stars are observed by looking through them. See figs. 1 and 3.

3. Drop the disc (fig. 5) within the border of the mother, and the _Rete_
over it. Take the sun's altitude by § 2, and let it be 25½°. As the
altitude was taken by the _back_ of the Astrolabe, turn it over, and then
let the _Rete_ revolve westward till the 1st point of Aries is just within
the altitude-circle marked 25, allowing for the ½ degree by guess. This
will bring the denticle near the letter C, and the first point of Aries
near X, which means 9 A.M. At the same time, the 20th degree of Gemini will
be on the _horizon obliquus_. See fig. 11, Pl. V. This result can be
approximately verified by a common globe thus; elevate the pole nearly 52°;
turn the small brass hour-circle so that the figure XII lies on the
equinoctial colure; then turn the globe till IX lies under the brass
meridian. In the next example, by the Astrolabe, let the height of Alhabor
(Sirius) be about 18°. Turn the denticle Eastward till it touches the 58th
degree near the letter O, and it will be found that Alhabor is about 18°
high among the _almicanteras_, whilst the first point of Aries points to
32° near the letter H, i.e. to 8 minutes past 8 P.M.; whilst at the same
time, the 23rd degree of Libra is almost on the _Horizon obliquus_ on the
Eastern side. By the globe, at about 8 minutes past 8 P.M., the altitude of
Sirius is very nearly 18°, and the 23rd of Libra is very near the Eastern
horizon. See fig. 12, Pl. V.

4. The ascendent at any given moment is that degree of the zodiac which is
then seen upon the Eastern horizon. Chaucer says that astrologers reckoned
in also 5 degrees _of the zodiac_ above, and 25 below; the object being to
extend the planet's influence over a whole 'house,' which is a space of the
same length as a _sign_, viz. 30°. See § 36 below.

5. This merely amounts to taking the mean between two results.

6. This depends upon the refraction of light by the atmosphere, owing to
which light from the sun reaches us whilst he is still 18° below the
horizon. The nadir of the sun being 18° high on the W. side, the sun itself
is 18° below the Eastern horizon, giving the time of dawn; and if the nadir
be 18° high on the E. side, we get the time of the end of the evening
twilight. Thus, at the vernal equinox, the sun is 18° high soon after 8
A.M. (roughly speaking), and hence the evening twilight ends soon after 8
P.M., 12 hours later, sunset being at 6 P.M.

7. Ex. The sun being in the first point of Cancer on the longest day, its
rising will be shewn by the point in fig. 5 where the _horizon obliquus_
and _Tropicus Cancri_ intersect; this corresponds to a point between P and
Q in fig. 2, or to about a quarter to 4 A.M. So too the sunset is at about
a quarter past 8, and the length of the day 16½ hours; hence also, the
length of the night is about 7½ hours, neglecting twilight.

8. On the same day, the number of degrees in the whole day is about 247½,
that being the number through which the _Rete_ is turned in the example to
§ 7. Divide by 15, and we have 16½ equal hours.

9. The 'day vulgar' is the length of the 'artificial day,' with the length
of the twilight, both at morn and at eve, added to it.

10. If, as in § 7, the day be 16½ hours long, the length of each 'hour
inequal' is 1 h. 22½ m.; and the length of each 'hour inequal' of the night
is the 12th part of 7½ hours, or 37½ m.; and 1 h. 22½ m., added to 37½ m.,
will of course make up 2 hours, or 30°.

11. This merely repeats that 15° of the border answer to an hour of the
clock. The '4 partie of this tretis' was never written.

12. This 'hour of the planet' is a mere astrological supposition, involving
no point of astronomy. Each hour is an 'hour inequal,' or the 12th part of
the artificial day or night. The assumptions are so made that _first_ hour
of every day may resemble the _name of the day_; the first hour of Sunday
is the hour of the _Sun_, and so on. These hours may be easily found by the
following method. Let 1 represent both Sunday and the Sun; 2, Monday and
the Moon; 3, Tuesday and Mars; 4, Wednesday and Mercury; 5, Thursday and
Jupiter; 6, Friday and Venus; 7, Saturday and Saturn. Next, write down the
following succession of figures, which will shew the hours at once.

  1642753|16427531642753164275316.

Ex. To find the planet of the 10th hour of Tuesday. Tuesday is the third
day of the week; begin with 3, to the left of the upright line, and reckon
10 onwards; the 10th figure (counting 3 as the _first_) is 6, i.e. Venus.
So also, the planet of the 24th hour of Friday is the Moon, and Saturday
begins with Saturn. It may be observed that this table can be carried in
the memory, by simply observing that the numbers are written, beginning
with 1, in the _reverse order of the spheres_, i.e. Sun, Venus, Mercury,
Moon; and then (beginning again at the outmost sphere) Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars. This is why Chaucer takes a _Saturday_; that he may begin with the
remotest planet, _Saturn_, and follow the reverse order of the spheres. See
fig. 10, Pl. V. Here, too, we have the obvious reason for the succession of
the names of the days of the week, viz. that the planets being reckoned in
this order, we find the Moon in the 25th place or hour from the Sun, and so
on.

13. The reason of this is obvious from what has gone before. The sun's
meridional altitude is at once seen by placing the sun's degree on the
South line.

14. This is the exact converse of the preceding. It furnishes a method of
testing the accuracy of the drawing of the almikanteras.

15. This is best done by help of the _back_ of the instrument, fig. 1. Thus
May 13 (old style), which lies 30° to the W. of the S. line, is nearly of
the same length as July 13, which lies 30° to the E. Secondly, the day of
April 2 (old style), 20° above the W. line, is nearly of the same length as
the night of Oct. 2, 20° below the E. line, in the opposite point of the
circle. This is but an approximation, as the divisions on the instrument
are rather minute.

16. This merely expresses the same thing, with the addition, that on days
of the same length, the sun has the same meridional altitude, and the same
declination from the equator.

17. Here _passeth any-thing the south westward_ means, passes somewhat to
the westward of the South line. The problem is, to find the degree of the
zodiac which is on the meridian with the star. To do this, find the
altitude of the star _before_ it souths, and by help of problem 3, find out
the ascending degree of the zodiac; secondly, find the ascending degree at
an equal time _after_ it souths, when the star has the same altitude as
before, and the mean between these will be the degree that ascends when the
star is on the meridian. Set this degree upon the Eastern part of the
_horizon obliquus_, and then the degree which is upon the meridional line
souths together with the star. Such is the solution given, but it is but a
very rough approximation, and by no means always near to the truth. An
example will shew why. Let Arcturus have the same altitude at 10 P.M. as at
2 A.M. In the first case the 4th of Sagittarius is ascending, in the second
(with sufficient accuracy for our purpose) the 2nd of Aquarius; and the
mean between these is the 3rd of Capricorn. Set this on the Eastern horizon
upon a globe, and it will be seen that it is 20 min. past midnight, that
10° of Scorpio is on the meridian, and that Arcturus has past the meridian
by 5°. At true midnight, the ascendent is the 29° of Sagittarius. The
reason of the error is that right ascension and longitude are here not
sufficiently distinguished. By observing the degrees of the _equinoctial_,
instead of the _ecliptic_, upon the Eastern horizon, we have at the first
observation 272°, at the second 332°, and the mean of these is 302°; from
this subtract 90°, and the result, 212°, gives the right ascension of
Arcturus very nearly, corresponding to which is the beginning of the 5° of
Scorpio, which souths along with it. This latter method is correct, because
it assumes the motion to take place round the axis of the equator. The
error of Chaucer's method is that it identifies the motion of the equator
with that of the ecliptic. The amount of the error varies considerably, and
may be rather large. But it can easily be diminished, (and no doubt was so
in practice), by taking the observations _as near the south line as
possible_. Curiously enough, the rest of the section explains the
difference between the two methods of reckoning. The modern method is to
call the co-ordinates _right ascension_ and _declination_, if reckoned from
the equator, and _longitude_ and _latitude_, if from the ecliptic. Motion
in _longitude_ is not the same thing as motion in _right ascension_.

18. The 'centre' of the star is the technical name for the extremity of the
metal tongue representing it. The 'degree in which the star standeth' is
considered to be that degree of the zodiac which souths along with it. Thus
Sirius or Alhabor has its true longitude nearly equal to that of 12° of
Cancer, but, as it souths with the 9th degree, it would be said to stand in
that degree. This may serve for an example; but it must be remembered that
its longitude was different in the time of Chaucer.

19. Also it rises with the 19th degree of Leo, as it is at some distance
from the zodiac in latitude. The same 'marvellous arising in a strange
sign' is hardly because of the latitude being north or south from the
_equinoctial_, but rather because it is north or south of the _ecliptic_.
For example, Regulus ([alpha] Leonis) is on the ecliptic, and of course
rises with that very degree in which it is. Hence the reading _equinoctial_
leaves the case in doubt, and we find a more correct statement just below,
where we have 'whan they have no latitude fro the ecliptik lyne.' At all
places, however, upon the earth's equator, the stars will rise with the
degrees of the zodiac in which they stand.]

20. Here the disc (fig. 5) is supposed to be placed beneath the Rete (fig.
2). The proposition merely tells us that the difference between the
meridian altitudes of the given degree of the zodiac and of the 1st point
of Aries is the _declination_ of that degree, which follows from the very
definition of the term. There is hardly any necessity for setting the
second prick, as it is sufficiently marked by being the point where the
equinoctial circle crosses the south line. If the given degree lie
_outside_ this circle, the declination is _south;_ if _inside_, it is
_north_.

21. In fig. 5, the almicanteras, if accurately drawn, ought to shew as many
degrees between the south point of the equinoctial circle and the zenith as
are equal to the latitude of the place for which they are described. The
number of degrees from the pole to the northern point of the _horizon
obliquus_ is of course the same. The latitude of the place for which the
disc is constructed is thus determined by inspection.

22. In the _first_ place where '_orisonte_' occurs, it means the _South_
point of the horizon; in the _second_ place, the _North_ point. By
referring to fig. 13, Plate V, it is clear that the arc [Aries]S,
representing the distance between the equinoctial and the S. point, is
equal to the arc ZP, which measures the distance from the pole to the
zenith; since PO[Aries] and ZOS are both right angles. Hence also Chaucer's
second statement, that the arcs PN and [Aries]Z are equal. In his numerical
example, PN is 51° 50'; and therefore ZP is the complement, or 38° 10'. So
also [Aries]Z is 51° 50'; and [Aries]S is 38° 10'. Briefly, [Aries]Z
measures the latitude.

23. Here the altitude of a star (A) is to be taken twice; firstly, when it
is on the meridian in the most _southern_ point of its course, and
secondly, when on the meridian in the most _northern_ point, which would be
the case twelve hours later. The mean of these altitudes is the altitude of
the pole, or the latitude of the place. In the example given, the star A is
only 4° from the pole, which shews that it is the Pole-star, then farther
from the Pole than it is now. The star F is, according to Chaucer, any
convenient star having a right ascension differing from that of the
Pole-star by 180°; though one having the _same_ right ascension would serve
as well. If then, at the first observation, the altitude of A be 56, and at
the second be 48, the altitude of the pole must be 52. See fig. 13, Plate
V.

24. This comes to much the same thing. The _lowest_ or northern altitude of
Dubhe ([alpha] Ursæ Majoris) may be supposed to be observed to be 25°, and
his _highest_ or southern altitude to be 79°. Add these; the sum is 104;
'abate' or subtract half of that number, and the result is 52°; the
latitude.

25. Here, as in § 22, Chaucer says that the latitude can be measured by the
arc Z[Aries] or PN; he adds that the depression of the Antarctic pole, viz.
the arc SP' (where P' is the S. pole), is another measure of the latitude.
He explains that an obvious way of finding the latitude is by finding the
altitude of the sun at noon at the time of an equinox. If this altitude be
38° 10', then the latitude is the complement, or 51° 50'. But this
observation can only be made on two days in the year. If then this seems to
be too long a tarrying, observe his midday altitude, and allow for his
declination. Thus, if the sun's altitude be 58° 10' at noon when he is in
the first degree of Leo, subtract his declination, viz. 20°, and the result
is 38° 10', the complement of the latitude. If, however, the sun's
declination be _south_, the amount of it must be added instead of
subtracted. Or else we may find [Aries]A', the highest altitude of a star
A' above the equinoctial, and also [Aries]A, its nether elongation
extending from the same, and take the mean of the two.

26. The 'Sphere Solid' answers nearly to what we now call a globe. By help
of a globe it is easy to find the ascensions of signs for _any latitude_,
whereas by the astrolabe we can only tell them for those latitudes for
which the plates bearing the almicanteras are constructed. The signs which
Chaucer calls 'of right (i.e. direct) ascension' are those signs of the
zodiac which rise more directly, i.e. at a greater angle to the horizon
than the rest. In latitude 52°, Libra rises so directly that the whole sign
takes more than 2¾ hours before it is wholly above the horizon, during
which time nearly 43° of the equinoctial circle have arisen; or, in
Chaucer's words, 'the more part' (i.e. a larger portion) of the equinoctial
ascends with it. On the other hand, the sign of Aries ascends so obliquely
that the whole of it appears above the horizon in less than an hour, so
that a 'less part' (a smaller portion) of the equinoctial ascends with it.
The following is a rough table of Direct and Oblique Signs, shewing
approximately how long each sign takes to ascend, and how many degrees of
the equinoctial ascend with it, in lat. 52°.

  _Oblique  Degrees of the  Time of   | _Direct   Degrees of the  Time of
   Signs._   Equinoctial.  ascending. |  Signs._   Equinoctial.  ascending.
  Capricornus      26°     1 h. 44 m. | Cancer           39°     2 h. 36 m.
  Aquarius         16°     1 h. 4 m.  | Leo              42°     2 h. 48 m.
  Pisces           14°     0 h. 56 m. | Virgo            43°     2 h. 52 m.
  Aries            14°     0 h. 56 m. | Libra            43°     2 h. 52 m.
  Taurus           16°     1 h. 4 m.  | Scorpio          42°     2 h. 48 m.
  Gemini           26°     1 h. 44 m. | Sagittarius      39°     2 h. 36 m.

These numbers are sufficiently accurate for the present purpose.

In ll. 8-11, there is a gap in the sense in nearly all the MSS., but the
Bodley MS. 619 fortunately supplies what is wanting, to the effect that, at
places situated on the equator, the poles are in the horizon. At such
places, the days and nights are always equal. Chaucer's next statement is
true for _all_ places _within the tropics_, the peculiarity of them being
that they have the sun vertical twice in a year. The statement about the
'two summer and winters' is best explained by the following. 'In the
tropical climates, ... seasons are caused more by the effect of the winds
(which are very regular, and depend mainly on the sun's position) than by
changes in the direct action of the sun's light and heat. The seasons are
not a summer and winter, so much as recurrences of wet and dry periods,
_two in each year_.'--English Cyclopædia; _Seasons, Change of_. Lastly,
Chaucer reverts to places on the equator, where the stars all seem to move
in vertical circles, and the almicanteras are therefore straight lines. The
line marked _Horizon Rectus_ is shewn in fig. 5, where the _Horizon
Obliquus_ is also shewn, cutting the equinoctial circle obliquely.

27. The real object in this section is to find how many degrees of the
equinoctial circle pass the meridian together with a given zodiacal sign.
Without even turning the _rete_, it is clear that the sign Aries, for
instance, extends through 28° of the equinoctial; for a line drawn from the
centre, in fig. 2, through the end of Aries will (if the figure be correct)
pass through the end of the 28th degree below the word _Oriens_.

28. To do this accurately requires a very carefully marked Astrolabe, on as
large a scale as is convenient. It is done by observing where the ends of
the given sign, estimated along the _outer_ rim of the zodiacal circle in
fig. 2, cross the _horizon obliquus_ as the _rete_ is turned about. Thus,
the beginning of Aries lies on the _horizon obliquus_, and as the _rete_
revolves to the right, the end of it, on the outer rim, will at last lie
exactly on the same curved line. When this is the case, the _rete_ ought to
have moved through an angle of about 14°, as explained in § 26. By far the
best way is to tabulate the results once for all, as I have there done. It
is readily seen, from fig. 2, that the signs from Aries to Virgo are
_northern_, and from Libra to Pisces are _southern_ signs. The signs from
Capricorn to Gemini are the _oblique_ signs, or as Chaucer calls them,
'tortuous,' and ascend in less than 2 hours; whilst the _direct_ signs,
from Cancer to Sagittarius, take more than 2 hours to ascend; as shewn in
the table on p. 209. The _eastern_ signs in fig. 2 are said to _obey to_
the corresponding _western_ ones.

29. Here _both_ sides of the Astrolabe are used, the 'rewle' being made to
revolve at the _back_, and the 'label' in _front_, as usual. First, by the
back of the instrument and the 'rewle,' take the sun's altitude. Turn the
Astrolabe round, and set the sun's degree at the right altitude among the
almicanteras, and then observe, by help of the label, how far the sun is
from the meridian. Again turn the instrument round, and set the 'rewle' as
far from the meridian as the label was. Then, holding the instrument as
near the ground and as horizontal as possible, let the sun shine through
the holes of the 'rewle,' and immediately after lay the Astrolabe down,
without altering the azimuthal direction of the meridional line. It is
clear that this line will then point southwards, and the other points of
the compass will also be known.

30. This turns upon the definition of the phrase 'the wey of the sonne.' It
does not mean the zodiacal circle, but the sun's apparent path on a given
day of the year. The sun's altitude changes but little in one day, and is
supposed here to remain the same throughout the time that he is, on that
day, visible. Thus, if the sun's altitude be 61½°, the _way of the sun_ is
a small circle, viz. the tropic of Cancer. If the planet be then on the
zodiac, in the 1st degree of Capricorn, it is 47° S. from the way of the
sun, and so on.

31. The word 'senith' is here used in a peculiar sense; it does not mean,
as it should, the _zenith_ point, or point directly overhead, but is made
to imply the point on the horizon, (either falling upon an azimuthal line,
or lying between two azimuths), which denotes the point of sunrise. In the
Latin rubric, it is called _signum_. This point is found by actual
observation of the sun at the time of rising. Chaucer's azimuths divide the
horizon into 24 parts; but it is interesting to observe his remark, that
'shipmen' divide the horizon into 32 parts, exactly as a compass is divided
now-a-days. The reason for the division into 32 parts is obviously because
this is the easiest way of reckoning the direction of the wind. For this
purpose, the horizon is first divided into 4 parts; each of these is
halved, and each half-part is halved again. It is easy to observe if the
wind lies half-way between S. and E., or half-way between S. and S.E., or
again half-way between S. and S.S.E.; but the division into 24 parts would
be unsuitable, because _third-parts_ are much more difficult to estimate.

32. The Latin rubric interprets the conjunction to mean that of the sun and
moon. The time of this conjunction is to be ascertained from a calendar.
If, e.g. the calendar indicates 9 A.M. as the time of conjunction on the
12th day of March, when the sun is in the first point of Aries, as in § 3,
the number of hours after the preceding midday is 21, which answers to the
letter X in the border (fig. 2). Turn the _rete_ till the first point of
Aries lies under the label, which is made to point to X, and the label
shews at the same moment that the degree of the sun is very nearly at the
point where the equinoctial circle crosses the azimuthal circle which lies
50° to the E. of the meridian. Hence the conjunction takes place at a point
of which the azimuth is 50° to the E. of the S. point, or 5° to the
eastward of the S.E. point. The proposition merely amounts to finding the
sun's azimuth at a given time. Fig. 11 shews the position of the _rete_ in
this case.

33. Here 'senyth' is again used to mean azimuth, and the proposition is, to
find the sun's azimuth by taking his altitude, and setting his degree at
the right altitude on the almicanteras. Of course the two  co-ordinates,
altitude and azimuth, readily indicate the sun's exact position; and the
same for any star or planet.

34. The moon's latitude is never more than 5¼° from the ecliptic, and this
small distance is, 'in common treatises of Astrolabie,' altogether
neglected; so that it is supposed to move in the ecliptic. First, then,
take the moon's altitude, say 30°. Next take the altitude of some bright
star 'on the moon's side,' i.e. nearly in the same azimuth as the moon,
taking care to choose a star which is represented upon the _Rete_ by a
pointed tongue. Bring this tongue's point to the right altitude among the
almicanteras, and then see which degree of the ecliptic lies on the
almicantera which denotes an altitude of 30°. This will give the moon's
place, 'if the stars in the Astrolabe be set after the truth,' i.e. if the
point of the tongue is exactly where it should be.

35. The motion of a planet is called _direct_, when it moves in the
direction of the succession of the zodiacal signs; _retrograde_, when in
the contrary direction. When a planet is on the right or east side of the
Meridional line, and is moving forward along the signs, without increase of
declination, its altitude will be less on the second occasion than on the
first at the moment when the altitude of the fixed star is the same as
before. The same is true if the planet be retrograde, and on the western
side. The contrary results occur when the second altitude is greater than
the first. But the great defect of this method is that it may be rendered
fallacious by a change in the planet's declination.

36. See fig. 14, Plate VI. If the equinoctial circle in this figure be
supposed to be superposed upon that in fig. 5, Plate III, and be further
supposed to revolve backwards through an angle of about 60° till the point
1 (fig. 14) rests upon the point where the 8th hour-line crosses the
equinoctial, the beginning of the 2nd house will then be found to be on the
line of midnight. Similarly, all the other results mentioned follow. For it
is easily seen that each 'house' occupies a space equal to 2 hours, so that
the bringing of the 3rd house to the midnight line brings 1 to the 10th
hour-line, and a similar placing of the 4th house brings 1 to the 12th
hour-line, which is the _horizon obliquus_ itself. Moving onward 2 more
hours, the point 7 (the nadir of 1) comes to the end of the 2nd hour,
whilst the 5th house comes to the north; and lastly, when 7 is at the end
of the 4th hour, the 6th house is so placed. To find the nadir of a house,
we have only to add 6; so that the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th
houses are the nadirs of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th houses
respectively.

37. Again see fig. 14, Plate VI. Here the 10th house is at once seen to be
on the meridional line. In the quadrant from 1 to 10, the even division of
the quadrant into 3 parts shews the 12th and 11th houses. Working downwards
from 1, we get the 2nd and 3rd houses, and the 4th house beginning with the
north line. The rest are easily found from their nadirs.

38. This problem is discussed in arts. 144 and 145 of Hymes's Astronomy,
2nd ed. 1840, p. 84. The words 'for warping' mean 'to prevent the errors
which may arise from the plate becoming warped.' The 'broader' of course
means 'the larger.' See fig. 15, Plate VI. If the shadow of the sun be
observed at a time _before_ midday when its extremity just enters within
the circle, and again at a time _after_ midday when it is just passing
beyond the circle, the altitude of the sun at these two observations must
be the same, and the south line must lie half-way between the two shadows.
In the figure, S and S' are the 2 positions of the sun, OT the rod, Ot and
Ot' the shadows, and OR the direction of the south line. Ott' is the metal
disc.

39. This begins with an explanation of the terms 'meridian' and
'longitude.' 'They chaungen her Almikanteras' means that they differ in
latitude. But, when Chaucer speaks of the longitude and latitude of a
'climate,' he means the length and breadth of it. A 'climate' (_clima_) is
a belt of the earth included between two fixed parallels of latitude. The
ancients reckoned _seven_ climates; in the sixteenth century there were
_nine_. The 'latitude of the climate' is the breadth of this belt; the
'longitude' of it he seems to consider as measured along lines lying
equidistant between the parallels of latitude of the places from which the
climates are named. See Stöffler, fol. 20 _b_; and Petri Apiani
Cosmographia, per Gemmam Phrysium restituta, ed. 1574, fol. 7 _b_. The
seven climates were as follows:--

1. That whose central line passes through Meroë (lat. 17°); from nearly 13°
to nearly 20°.

2. Central line, through Syene (lat. 24°); from 20° to 27°, nearly.

3. Central line through Alexandria (lat. 31°); from 27° to 34°, nearly.

4. Central line through Rhodes (lat. 36°); from 34° to 39°, nearly.

5. Central line through Rome (lat. 41°); from 39° to 43°, nearly.

6. Central line through Borysthenes (lat. 45°); from 43° to 47°.

7. Through the Riphæan mountains (lat. 48°); from 47° to 50°. But Chaucer
must have included an _eighth_ climate (called _ultra Mæotides paludes_)
from 50° to 56°; and a _ninth_, from 56° to the pole. The part of the earth
to the north of the 7th climate was considered by the ancients to be
uninhabitable. A rough drawing of these climates is given in MS. Camb.
Univ. Lib. Ii. 3. 3, fol. 33 _b_.

40. The longitude and latitude of a planet being ascertained from an
almanac, we can find with what degree it ascends. For example, given that
the longitude of Venus is 6° of Capricorn, and her N. latitude 2°. Set the
one leg of a compass upon the degree of longitude, and extend the other
till the distance between the two legs is 2° of latitude, from that point
inward, i.e. northward. The 6th degree of Capricorn is now to be set on the
horizon, the label (slightly coated with wax) to be made to point to the
same degree, and the north latitude is set off upon the wax by help of the
compass. The spot thus marking the planet's position is, by a very slight
movement of the _Rete_, to be brought upon the horizon, and it will be
found that the planet (situated 2° N. of the 6th degree) ascends together
with the _head_ (or beginning of the sign) of Capricorn. This result, which
is not _quite_ exact, is easily tested by a globe. When the latitude of the
planet is _south_, its place cannot well be found when in Capricorn for
want of space at the edge of the Astrolabe.

As a second example, it will be found that, when Jupiter's longitude is at
the _end_ of 1° of Pisces, and his latitude 3° south, he ascends together
with the 14th of Pisces, nearly. This is easily verified by a globe, which
solves all such problems very readily.

It is a singular fact that most of the best MSS. leave off at the word
'houre,' leaving the last sentence incomplete. I quote the last five
words--'þou shalt do wel y-now'--from the MS. in St. John's College,
Cambridge; they also occur in the old editions.

41. Sections 41-43 and 41_a_-42_b_ are from the MS. in St. John's College,
Cambridge. For the scale of _umbra recta_, see fig. 1, Plate I. Observe
that the _umbra recta_ is used where the angle of elevation of an object is
greater than 45°; the _umbra versa_, where it is less. See also fig. 16,
Plate VI; where, if AC be the height of the tower, BC the same height
_minus_ the height of the observer's eye (supposed to be placed at E), and
EB the distance of the observer from the tower, then _bc_ : E_b_ :: EB :
BC. But E_b_ is reckoned as 12, and if _bc_ be 4, we find that BC is 3 EB,
i.e. 60 feet, when EB is 20. Hence AC is 60 feet, _plus_ the height of the
observer's eye. The last sentence is to be read thus--'And if thy "rewle"
fall upon 5, then are 5-12ths of the height equivalent to the space between
thee and the tower (with addition of thine own height).' The MS. reads '5
12-p_ar_tyes þe hey[gh]t of þe space,' &c.; but the word _of_ must be
transposed, in order to make sense. It is clear that, if _bc_ = 5, then 5 :
12 :: EB : BC, which is the same as saying that EB = 5/12 BC. Conversely,
BC is 12/5 EB = 48, if EB = 20.

42. See fig. 1, Plate I. See also fig. 17, Plate VI. Let E_b_ = 12, _bc_ =
1; also E'_b'_ = 12, _b'c'_ = 2; then EB = 12 BC, E'B = 6 BC; therefore EE'
= 6 BC. If EE' = 60 feet, then BC = 1/6 EE'=10 feet. To get the whole
height, add the height of the eye. The last part of the article, beginning
'For other poyntis,' is altogether corrupt in the MS.

43. Here _versa_ (in M.) is certainly miswritten for _recta_, as in L. See
fig. 18, Plate VI. Here E_b_ = E'_b'_ = 12; _b'c'_ = 1, _bc_ = 2. Hence E'B
= 1/12 BC, EB = 2/12 BC. whence EE' = 1/12 BC. Or again, if _bc_ become =
3, 4, 5, &c., successively, whilst _b'c'_ remains = 1, then EE' is
successively = 2/12 or 1/6, 3/12 or 1/4, 5/12, &c. Afterwards, add in the
height of E.

44. Sections 44 and 45 are from MS. Digby 72. This long explanation of the
method of finding a planet's place depends upon the tables which were
constructed for that purpose from observation. The general idea is this.
The figures shewing a planet's position for the last day of December, 1397,
give what is called the _root_, and afford us, in fact, a _starting-point_
from which to measure. An 'argument' is the angle upon which the tabulated
quantity depends; for example, a very important 'argument' is the planet's
_longitude_, upon which its _declination_ may be made to depend, so as to
admit of tabulation. The planet's longitude for the given above-mentioned
date being taken as the _root_, the planet's longitude at a second date can
be found from the tables. If this second date be less than 20 years
afterwards, the increase of motion is set down separately for each year,
viz. so much in 1 year, so much in 2 years, and so on. These separate years
are called _anni expansi_. But when the increase during a large round
number of years (such as 20, 40, or 60 years at once) is allowed for, such
years are called _anni collecti_. For example, a period of 27 years
includes 20 years _taken together_, and 7 separate or _expanse_ years. The
mean motion during smaller periods of time, such as months, days, and
hours, is added in afterwards.

45. Here the author enters a little more into particulars. If the mean
motion be required for the year 1400, 3 years later than the
starting-point, look for 3 in the table of expanse years, and add the
result to the number already corresponding to the 'root,' which is
calculated for the last day of December, 1397. Allow for months and days
afterwards. For a date earlier than 1397 the process is just reversed,
involving subtraction instead of addition.

46. This article is probably not Chaucer's. It is found in MS. Bodley 619,
and in MS. Addit. 29250. The text is from the former of these, collated
with the latter. What it asserts comes to this. Suppose it be noted, that
at a given place, there is a full flood when the moon is in a certain
quarter; say, e.g. when the moon is due east. And suppose that, at the time
of observation, the moon's actual longitude is such that it is in the first
point of Cancer. Make the label point due east; then bring the first point
of Cancer to the east by turning the _Rete_ a quarter of the way round. Let
the sun at the time be in the first point of Leo, and bring the label over
this point by the motion of the label only, keeping the _Rete_ fixed. The
label then points nearly to the 32nd degree near the letter Q, or about
S.E. by E.; shewing that the sun is S.E. by E. (and the moon consequently
due E.) at about 4 A.M. In fact, the article merely asserts that the moon's
place in the sky is known from the sun's place, if the difference of their
longitudes be known. At the time of conjunction, the moon and sun are
together, and the difference of their longitudes is zero, which much
simplifies the problem. If there is a flood tide when the moon is in the
E., there is another when it comes to the W., so that there is high water
_twice_ a day. It may be doubted whether this proposition is of much
practical utility.

41_a_: This comes to precisely the same as Art. 41, but is expressed with a
slight difference. See fig. 16, where, if _bc_ = 8, then BC = 12/8 EB.

41_b_: Merely another repetition of Art. 41. It is hard to see why it
should be thus repeated in almost the same words. If _bc_ = 8 in fig. 16,
then EB = 8/12 BC = 2/3 BC. The only difference is that it inverts the
equation in the last article.]

42_a_ This is only a particular case of Art. 42. If we can get _bc_ = 3,
and _b'c'_ = 4, the equations become EB = 4BC, E'B = 3BC; whence EE' = BC,
a very convenient result. See fig. 17.]

43_a_: The reading _versam_ (as in the MS.) is absurd. We must also read
'_nat_ come,' as, if the base were approachable, no such trouble need be
taken; see Art. 41. In fact, the present article is a mere repetition of
Art. 43, with different numbers, and with a slight difference in the method
of expressing the result. In fig. 18, if _b'c'_ = 3, _bc_ = 4, we have E'B
= 3/12 BC, EB = 4/12 BC; or, subtracting, EE' = (4-3)/12 BC; or BC = 12
EE'. Then add the height of E, viz. E_a_, which = AB.

42_b._: Here, 'by the craft of _Umbra Recta_' signifies, by a method
similar to that in the last article, for which purpose the numbers must be
adapted for computation by the _umbra recta_. Moreover, it is clear, from
fig. 17, that the numbers 4 and 3 (in lines 2 and 4) must be transposed. If
the side parallel to _b_E be called _nm_, and _mn_, E_c_ be produced to
meet in _o_, then _mo_ : _m_E :: _b_E : _bc_; or _mo_ : 12 :: 12 : _bc_; or
_mo_ = 144, divided by _bc_ (= 3) = 48. Similarly, _m'o'_ = 144, divided by
_b'c'_ (= 4) = 36. And, as in the last article, the difference of these is
to 12, as the space EE' is to the altitude. This is nothing but Art. 42 in
a rather clumsier shape.

Hence it appears that there are here but 3 independent propositions, viz.
those in articles 41, 42, and 43, corresponding to figs. 16, 17, and 18
respectively. Arts. 41_a_ and 41_b_ are mere repetitions of 41; 42_a_ and
42_b_, of 42; and 43_a_, of 43.

PROLOGUE. l. 26. thise B; þese C; _miswritten_ this A; see above, ll. 21,
22.

32. curious BC; _miswritten_ curios A.

Many similar very slight alterations of spelling have been silently made in
the text, and are not worth specifying here. A complete list of them is
given in my edition of this treatise for the Early English Text Society. I
give, however, the real variations of reading. Thus, in l. 58, A. has _som_
for _sonne_; and in l. 64 omits the second _the_.


PART I. § 1, l. 3. wol B; wolde AC.

§ 2, l. 2. _Rowm_ is here an adjective, meaning _large_, _ample_. It is the
right reading; we find Rowm AB rowme C; rvm M.

§ 3, l. 1. AB _omit_ the.

§ 9, l. 3. nombre AB; nou_m_bre C; _but_ nombres _in old editions_.

§ 12, l. 5. The MSS. all[60] read--'_vmbra recta_ or elles _vmbra extensa_,
& the nether partie is cleped the _vmbra versa_.' This is certainly wrong.

§ 13, l. 2. a certein] _so in_ AB; CM _omit_ a. But Chaucer certainly uses
the phrase 'a certain'; cf. 'of unces a certain,' C. T., G 776; and see G
1024.

§ 14, ll. 2, 5. The word _halt_ for _holdeth_, and the expression
_to-hepe_, together, both occur in Troil. iii. 1764:--

  'And lost were al, that Love _halt_ now _to-hepe_.'

§ 17, l. 1. principal C; tropikal AB; M _om._ The reading _tropikal_ is
absurd, because there are but _two_ such; besides which, see l. 34 below.

17. the nyht (_over an erasure_) B; thee nyht (_over an erasure_) A; þe
ni[gh]tes C; þe ny[gh]tes M.

§ 20, l. 4. figure; _here (and sometimes elsewhere) miswritten_ vig_ur_ A.
Throughout the whole treatise, the scribe has commonly written 'vig_ur_';
in many places, it has been corrected to 'fig_ur_e.'

§ 21, l. 15. the (_before_ sterres) _supplied from_ BC.

27. where as C; wher AB.

56. ou_er_keruyd A; ou_er_kerued B; ou_er_kerueth (_the latter part of the
word over an erasure_) C; _first time only_.


PART II. § 2, l. 8. eu_er_ M; euere C; eu_er_y (_wrongly_) AB.

§ 3, ll. 31, 32. A _has_ 12 degres, _corrected to_ 18 degres; B. _has_ 12
degrees; C _has_ 18. The numbers in the MSS. in these propositions are
somewhat uncertain; it seems probable that some alteration was made by
Chaucer himself.

The readings in MS. B give one set of calculations, which are no doubt the
original ones; for in MS. A the same set is again found, but altered
throughout, by the scribe who drew the diagrams. The sets of readings are
these:--

Ll. 31, 32. 12 degrees B; _so in_ A, _but altered to_ 18; C _has_ 18.

37. passed 9 of the clokke the space of 10 degrees B; _so in_ A, _with_ 9
_altered to_ 8, _and_ 10 _altered to_ 2; C _has_ ij _for_ 9, _but agrees
with_ A _in the reading_ 2.

39. fond ther 10 degrees of taur_us_ B; _so in_ A _originally, but_ 10 _has
been corrected to_ 23, _and_ libra _is written over an erasure_. C _agrees
with neither, having_ 20 _for_ 10, _but agreeing with_ A _as to_ libra. The
later MSS. sometimes vary from all these.

42. an _supplied from_ C; AB _omit._

§ 4, l. 5. largest C; largesse AB.

6. upon C; vn (!) AB.

8. forseide degree of his longitude] forseyde same degre of hys longitude
C; forseid same gre of his longitude P; forseyde latitude his longitude
(_sic!_) AB.

9. planete ys C; _miswritten_ planetes AB, _but_ is _is added in margin of_
A.

16. For '25 degrees,' all the MSS. have '15 degrees.' The mistake is
probably Chaucer's own; the correction was made by Mr. Brae, who remarks
that it is a mere translation from the Latin version of Ptolemy's
Tetrabiblos, which has--'Signum ascendentis, quod est a _quinque_ gradibus
qui super horizontem ante ipsum ascenderant usque ad _viginti quinque_ qui
ad ascendentem remanserint'; Lib. iii. c. 10. In fact, it is clear that 25
must be added to 5 to make up the extent of a 'house,' which was 30
degrees.

16. ys like C; is lik P; _miswritten_ illyk AB.

17. in _is supplied from_ GM; ABC _omit it_.

23. _second_ the _supplied from_ CP; AB _omit_.

32. wel _supplied from_ CPM; AB _omit_.

36. than] þan CM; þenne P; AB _omit_.

40. _The number_ 10 _is supplied from_ C; AB _omit_.

42. some folk _supplied from_ CPG; AB _omit_.

44. yit is] AB _wrongly have_ yit it is; _but_ CPGM _omit_ it.

§ 5, l. 3. by 2 and 2 ACG; by 3 and 3 P; _left blank in_ B. Either reading
makes sense, but it is clear that divisions representing three degrees each
must have been very awkward.

10. of _supplied from_ CPGM: AB _omit_.

§ 6, l. 5. est C; west A (_which is absurd_); west (_corrected to_ est) B.

9. signe CGP; signes ABM.

§ 10, l. 3. than B; þan C; A _has_ & by nyht, _which is absurd_.

4, 5. A _omits_ day with the howr inequal of the, _which is supplied from_
BCP; _the number_ 30 _is also supplied from_ BCM, _as_ A _has a blank space
here_; see l. 10.

§ 11, l. 12. _The number_ 4 _is from_ CP; AB _omit; old edd._ fourthe.

13. ther _supplied from_ PM; þere C; AB _omit_.

§ 12, l. 1. the _supplied from_ BC; A _omits_.

8. _The figure_ 2 _is from_ BCP; G _has_ secunde; A _omits_.

§ 14, l. 9, 10. The last clause supplied from B.

§ 15, l. 6. pointe] point P; pointes A; pointz B; poy_n_tes C; _but grammar
requires the singular_.

9. the _supplied from_ CP; AB _omit_.

§ 16, l. 5. AB _wrongly insert_ the _before_ Cancer; CP _omit it_.

8. y-lyke] Ilyke G; ilik P; y-like C; ilke AB; see l. 7.

§ 17. _Latin rubric_; for _latitudinem_ (as in M) read _longitudinem_. l.
18. heued B; hed ACP; see sect. 16, l. 3. The word 'the' (rightly placed in
BCMP) is, in A, wrongly placed before 'Aries' instead of before 'ende.'

23. _second_ the] þe C; AB _omit_.

§ 19. _Latin Rubric_; for _orizon_ (as in M) read _statio_.

§ 20. _Latin Rubric_; the MS. (M) transposes the words _in_ and _a_, having
_a zodiaco in circulo_, which contradicts the sense.

§ 22. _Latin Rubric_; for _centri_ (as in M) read _regionis_.

§ 23, l. 21. The figure '8' is omitted in AB.

23. than] A _omits_; thanne _inserted afterwards in_ B.

§ 25, l. 3. _first_ the] _supplied from_ B; AC _omit_.

15. CP _om._ and 10 minutes.

16. CP _om._ and minutes out. _For_ 51 degrees and 50 minutes, C _has_ 52,
þan is 52 degrees; _and_ P _has_ 52. Þenne is .52. grees.

19. CP _om._ as I mighte prove.

20. the _supplied from_ CP; AB _om._

27. the firste degree] 10 degrees C; 10 gree P.

28. 58 degrees and 10 minutes] almost 56 C (_meaning_ 56 degrees); almost
.56. grees P.

29. almost 20] almost 18 C.

31. thee] C _om._ and odde Minutes] CP _om._

It thus appears that there is a second set of readings, involving a
different calculation. The second set supposes the Sun to be in the 10th
degree of Leo, his altitude to be 56°, and his declination 18°; the
difference, viz. 38°, is the complement of the latitude. Either set of
readings suits the sense, but the one in the text agrees best with the
former latitude, viz. 51°. 50'.

37. _After_ there, C _inserts_ 38 grees, þat is; _and omits the words_ of
the pole, 51 degrees and 50 minutes. But this is a mere repetition of the
'height of the Equinoctial,' and is obviously wrong. _After_ pole, _in_ l.
38, A _inserts_ an that, _which is unmeaning, and omitted in_ B.

§ 26, l. 8. Nearly all the MSS. omit from _Fertherover_ down to _right
orisonte_. The missing clause appears in MS. Bodley 619; I have not found
it elsewhere. It is obviously correct, and agrees sufficiently closely with
the conjectural addition by Mr. Brae, in his edition of Chaucer's
Astrolabe, p. 48.

§ 27, l. 2. _second_ the] _supplied from_ BCPM; A _om._

§ 28. _Latin Rubric._ MS. has _in recto circulo_; read _obliquo_.

3. set] sett C; sete P; AB _omit_.

11. these] þese C; thise B; the A.

23. ende] heed A; heued C. In fact, _heed_, _heued_, or _hed_ seems to be
the reading of all the MSS. and printed copies, and may have been a slip of
the pen in the first instance. The reading _ende_ is, however, amply
justified by its previous occurrence, four times over, in lines 10, 13, 16,
18. We thus have

  Six Northern signs. From _head_ of Aries to _end_ of Virgo.
  Six Southern signs. From _head_ of Libra to _end_ of Pisces.
  Six Tortuous signs. From _head_ of Capricorn to _end_ of Gemini.
  Six Direct signs. From _head_ of Cancer to _end_ of Sagittarius.

Opposite 'sagittare' is written 'sagittarie' in the margin of A, probably
as a correction; but it is left uncorrected in l. 27.

§ 29, l. 3. Turne thanne] Turne þan C; turn_e_ the thanne AB.

9. thou] þou C; two AB.

14. rewle] rule CP; _miswritten_ rewles AB; _see_ l. 9.

§ 30. l. 11. wey A; place C. _After_ zodiak C _inserts_--for on þe morowe
wol þe s_on_ne be in a-noþer degre þan þan, et cetera; P _inserts_--For yn
þe morowe wol þe sonne be yn an oþer gree, & norþ_er_ or souþ_er_ par
aventure. Nothing can be plainer than that 'the way of the sun' in this
passage means the small circle formed by the sun's apparent path during a
day; the text says expressly--'the wey wher as the sonne wente thilke day.'
We need not argue about the impossibility of a planet being found in 'the
way of the Sun' at midnight at the time of the Summer solstice, because
Chaucer makes no assertion whatever here about the relative positions of
the sun and planet; indeed, he carefully repeats 'if' three times. He is
only concerned with defining the phrase--'the latitude of a planet from the
way of the sun'; and in every possible case, it is clear that a planet can
be either (1) situate in the small circle called in the Latin rubric
_cursus solis_, or (2) to the north of such a circle, or (3) to the south
of such a circle. About this there need be no difficulty at all. It is all
copied from Messahala.

§ 31, l. 7. azimut] azymutz ABC; cf. sect. 32, l. 8.

§ 33, l. 2. Azimut] Azymutz ABC; minutis P; _the same error as in_ sect.
31, l. 7; _but see_ sect. 32, l. 8.

3. _second_ in] yn P; ABC _omit_.

4. the night] _so in_ AB; CP _om._ the.

§ 34. _English Rubric_; latitude for] _so in_ CP; latitude and for AB.

6. toucheth] touchiþ P; to which (_sic_) ABC; _see_ sect. 27, l. 6.

§ 35, l. 15. _After_ west side, AB _add_ & yf he be on the est syde, _a
mere superfluous repetition_; see l. 11.

17. sothly] soþly CP; _miswritten_ he settes (!) AB.

18. hir Episicle] _so in_ CP; _by an odd mistake_, AB _put_ hire _after_
manere, _instead of before_ Episicle.

§ 37, l. 10. than] þan C; AB _omit_. is] AS _omit; but it is obviously
wanted_; C _varies here_.

12. 12 house next] 12 hous next C; howses nex (_sic_) AB.

13. thanne] þan C; A _omits_. howse] hous C; howses AB.

17. AB _absurdly insert_ fro _before_ the byginning.

18. _first_ the] þe C; AB _omit_.

§ 38, l. 1. warpyng MP; werpynge C; weripinge (_sic_) A.

2. _first_ a CP; AB _omit_.

3, 4. an euene C; a enene AB (_twice_).

8. fro the centre; i.e. _above_ the centre. The length of the pin, measured
from the centre in which it is inserted, is to be not more than a quarter
of the diameter, or half the radius. This would make the ratio of the
gnomon to the shadow (or radius) to be one-half, corresponding to an
altitude _a_, where tan _a_ = ½; i.e. to an altitude of about 26½°. As
Chaucer talks about the sun's altitude being 25½° at about 9 o'clock, at
the time of the equinoxes (sect. 3), there is nothing that is particularly
absurd in the text of this section. For Mr. Brae's conjectural emendations,
see p. 56 of his edition.

16. tak thanne] _so in_ P; tak me thanne AB; take me þan C. But there seems
no sufficient reason for thus inserting _me_ here.

§ 39. At this point MS. A, which has so far, in spite of occasional errors
of the scribe, afforded a very fair text, begins to break down; probably
because the corrector's hand has not touched the two concluding sections,
although section 40 is much less corrupt. The result is worth recording, as
it shews what we may expect to find, even in good MSS. of the Astrolabe.
The section commences thus (the obvious misreadings being printed in
italics):--

'This lyne M_e_ridional ys but a Man_er_ desc_r_ipc_i_on _or the_ ymagined,
that passeth vpon the pooles of þis _the_ world And by the cenyth of owre
heued / And hit is _the same_ lyne M_er_idional / for in what place þat any
maner man [_omission_] any tyme of the yer / whan that the sonne _schyneth
ony thing_ of the firmament cometh to his verrey _Middel lyne of the_ place
/ than is hit verrey Midday, þat we clepen owre noon,' &c.

It seems clear that this apparent trash was produced by a careless scribe,
who had a good copy before him; it is therefore not necessary to reject it
all as unworthy of consideration, but it is very necessary to correct it by
collation with other copies. And this is what I have done.

MS. B has almost exactly the same words; but the section is considerably
better, in general sense, in MSS. C and P, for which reason I here quote
from the former the whole section.

  [_Rawl. MS. Misc. 1370, fol. 40 b._]

  DESCRIPCIOUN OF ÞE MERIDIONAL LYNE, OF ÞE LONGITUDES AND LATITUDES OF
  CITEES AND TOWNES, AS WEL AS OF A (SIC) CLYMATZ.

  39. _conclusio._ This lyne meridional is but a man_er_ discripcio[=n] or
  lyne ymagyned, þat passeþ upon þe pooles of þis worlde, and by þe Cenith
  of oure heued. ¶ And yt is cleped þe lyne meridional, for in what place
  þat any man ys at any time of þe [gh]ere, whan þat þe so_n_ne by menynge
  of þe firmament come to his uerrey meridian place / þan is it þe u_er_rey

The corrections made in this section are here fully described.

1. of lyne P; of a line I; or lyne C; or the AB.

2. this] þis the AB, _absurdly;_ CP _omit_ the, _rightly_.

3. ycleped the] y-clupid þe P; cleped þe C; the same (_sic_) AB.

4. is at; _supplied from_ PCI; AB _omit_.

5. by moeving] by meuynge C; by mevyng PI; schyneth ony thing (_sic_) A;
schyned eny thing B; _for the spelling_ moeving, _see_ sect. 35, l. 5.

6. meridian CP; meridianale I; Middel lyne of the (_sic_) AB.

8. 2 citees CI; too citees P; any lynes (_sic_) AB.

9. aprocheth] a-procheþ C; ap_ro_chiþ P; _miswritten_ aprochid AB.

more toward] neer C; ner P; neerer I; thoward AB.

11. conteyned I; conteynyd P; contened C; consideer_e_d (_sic_) A; contined
B.

13. yf P; [gh]if C; if it I; AB _omit_. N.B. It is best to use the spelling
_yif_, as the word is commonly so spelt in A.

22. same CPI; s_e_c_on_de AB. The reading _same_ is right; for the
'latitude of a climate' means the breadth of a zone of the earth, and the
latitude of the first climate (here chosen by way of example) is the
breadth as measured along a great circle perpendicular to the equator, from
the beginning of the said first climate to the end of _the same_. The words
'evene-directe agayns the poole Artik' mean in the direction of the North
pole; i.e. the latitude of a climate is reckoned from its beginning, or
_southernmost_ boundary-line, towards the end of the same, viz. its
_northern_ boundary-line.

22. þe poole Artik P; þe pool artyke C; the pole artike I; from north to
south AB. Observe that this singular error in A, 'euene direct_e_ agayns
from north to south,' probably arose from a confusion of the text 'euene
direct_e_ agayns þe poole Artik' with a gloss upon it, which was 'from
north to south.' It is important as throwing light on the meaning of the
phrase, and proving that the interpretation of it given above (note to l.
22) is correct.

24. intercept CP; intercepte I; except (_over an erasure_) AB.

The only reading about which there is any doubt is that in line 18, which
may be either 'illike distant by-twene them alle' (A), or 'I-like distaunte
fro þe equinoxial' (C). But it is immaterial which reading be adopted,
since _Illike-distant_ is here used merely in the sense of _parallel_, and
the boundaries of the climates are parallel both to one another, and to the
equinoctial. The climates themselves were of different breadths.

§ 40, l. 4. this samples AB; þese ensamples C.

5. for sothe] _miswritten_ for sonne AB; in gen_er_al C; yn special P; _the
reading_ sonne _points to_ sothe, _and makes it very probable that_ for
sothe _is the true reading_.

6. the longitude] þe longitude C; latitude AB (_absurdly_); see l. 11.

7. planete; _miswritten_ that A, _but corrected_ to planete _in the
margin_; C _has_ planete, _correctly_. The figure 6 is omitted in C; so are
all the other figures further on. him] hir C.

8. I tok] Than toke I C. 8, 16. 2 degrees A; 3 degrees B.

10. Than tok I] Than toke I C; _for_ tok AB _wrongly have_ stykke,
_afterwards altered to_ stokke _in_ A. _second_ the] _supplied from_ C,
_which has_ þe; AB _omit_.

23. the] þe C; AB _omit_.

27. prikke] prickes C; _perhaps_ prikkes _would be a better reading_.

29. AB _omit the figure_ 2; _but see_ l. 8.

31. in alle] in al C; A _has_ septe_n_t_r_ionalle, _an obvious mistake for_
septe_n_trional in alle, _by confusion of the syllable_ 'al' _in the former
with_ 'al' _in the latter word_; B _has_ septentrional, _omitting_ in alle.

34. signes C] tymes AB (_wrongly_); see l. 32.

46. _Perhaps_ evene _before_ of _should be omitted, as in_ C. AB _have_ in

NOTES TO THE HOUSE OF FAME.

BOOK I.

Written in three Books; but I number the lines consecutively throughout,
for convenience; at the same time giving the _separate_ numbering (of Books
II. and III.) within marks of parenthesis. The title of the poem is
expressly given at l. 663. The author gives his name as Geffrey; l. 729.

Lydgate's Temple of Glass is partly imitated from the House of Fame;
Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, 1871, iii. 61. The same is true of the Palice of
Honour, by Gawain Douglas. For further remarks, see the Introduction.

As the poem is not quite easy to follow, I here subjoin a brief Argument of
its contents.

BOOK I. A discussion on dreams. I will tell you my dream on the 10th of
December. But first let me invoke Morpheus. May those who gladly hear me
have joy; but may those who dislike my words have as evil a fate as
Croesus, King of Lydia! (1-110).

I slept, and dreamt I was in a temple of glass, dedicated to Venus. On a
table of brass I found the opening words of Vergil's Æneid; after which I
saw the destruction of Troy, the death of Priam, the flight of Æneas, the
loss of Creusa, the voyage of Æneas to Italy, the storm at sea sent by
Juno, the arrival of Æneas at Carthage, how kindly Dido received him, and
how Æneas betrayed and left her, causing Dido's lament and suicide. Similar
falsehood was seen in Demophon, Achilles, Paris, Jason, Hercules, and
Theseus. Next, Æneas sailed to Italy, and lost Palinurus; he visited the
lower regions, where he saw Anchises, Palinurus, Dido, and Deiphobus.
Afterwards he warred in Italy, slew Turnus, and won Lavinia (111-467).

After this I went out of the temple, and found a large plain. Looking up, I
saw an eagle above me, of enormous size and having golden feathers
(468-508).

BOOK II. Such a strange vision as mine never appeared to Scipio,
Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, or Turnus. O Venus and Muses, help me to tell it!
The great eagle swooped down upon me, seized me, and bore me aloft, and
told me (in a man's voice) not to be afraid. I thought I was being borne up
to the stars, like Enoch or Ganymede. The eagle then addressed me, and told
me some events of my own life, and said that he would bear me to the House
of Fame, where I should hear many wonderful things (509-710).

The House stood in the midst, between heaven, earth, and sea; and all
sounds travelled thither, 'Geoffrey,' said he, 'you know how all things
tend to seek their own proper place; a stone sinks down, while smoke flies
up. Sound is merely broken air, and if you would know how all sounds come
to Fame's House, observe how, when a stone is thrown into water, the rings
made by the ripples extend from the spot where it fell till they reach the
shore. Just so all earthly sounds travel till they reach Fame's House.' He
then bade me look below me, and asked what I saw. I saw fields, hills,
rivers, towns, and sea; but soon he had soared so high that the earth
dwindled to a point. I was higher up (I said) than ever was Alexander,
Scipio, or Dædalus. He then bade me look upward; I saw the zodiac, the
milky way, and clouds, snows, and rain beneath me. Then I thought of the
descriptions of heaven in Boethius and Marcian. The eagle would have taught
me the names of the stars; I refused to learn. He then asked if I could now
hear the sounds that murmured in the House of Fame. I said they sounded
like the beating of the sea on rocks (711-1045).

Then he set me down upon my feet in a way that led to the House, and bade
me go forward; observing that I should find that the _words_ that flew
about in Fame's House assumed the outward forms of the _men_ upon earth who
uttered them (1046-90).

BOOK III. Apollo, aid me to write this last book! My rime is artless; I aim
at expressing my thoughts only (1091-1109).

The House of Fame stood high upon a lofty rock, which I climbed
laboriously. The rock was formed of ice. On the southern side it was
covered with names, many of the letters of which were melted away. On the
northern side, it was likewise covered with names, which remained unmelted
and legible. On the top of the mountain I found a beautiful House, which I
cannot describe though I remember it. It was all of beryl, and full of
windows. In niches round about were harpers and minstrels, such as Orpheus,
Arion, Chiron, and Glasgerion. Far from these, by themselves, was a vast
crowd of musicians. There were Marsyas, Misenus, Joab, and others. In other
seats were jugglers, sorcerers, and magicians; Medea, Circe, Hermes, and
Coll Tregetour. I next beheld the golden gates. Then I heard the cries of
those that were heralds to the goddess Fame. How shall I describe the great
hall, that was plated with gold, and set with gems? High on a throne of
ruby sat the goddess, who at first seemed but a dwarf, but presently grew
so that she reached, from earth to heaven. Her hair was golden, and she was
covered with innumerable ears and tongues. Her shoulders sustained the
names of famous men, such as Alexander and Hercules. On either side of the
hall were huge pillars of metal. On the first of these, composed of lead
and iron, was the Jew Josephus; the iron was the metal of Mercury, and the
lead of Saturn. Next, on an iron pillar, was Statius; and on other iron
pillars were Homer, Dares, Dictys, Guido, and the English Geoffrey, who
upbore the fame of Troy. On a pillar of iron, but covered over with tin,
was Vergil; and beside him Ovid and Lucan. On a pillar of sulphur stood
Claudian (1110-1512).

Next I saw a vast company, all worshipping Fame. These she rejected, but
would say of them neither good nor bad. She then sent a messenger to fetch
Æolus, the god of wind, who should bring with him two trumpets, namely of
Praise and Slander. Æolus, with his man Triton, came to Fame. And when many
undeserving suppliants approached her, she bade Æolus blow his black trump
of Slander. He did so, and from it there issued a stinking smoke; and so
this second company got renown, but it was evil. A third company sued to
her, and she bade Æolus blow his golden trump of Praise. Straightway he did
so, and the blast had a perfume like that of balm and roses. A fourth
company, a very small one, asked for no fame at all, and their request was
granted. A fifth company modestly asked for no fame, though they had done
great things; but Fame bade Æolus blow his golden trumpet, till their
praise resounded everywhere. A sixth company of idle men, who had done no
good, asked for fame; and their request was granted. A seventh company made
the same request; but Fame reviled them; Æolus blew his black trump, and
all men laughed at them. An eighth company, of wicked men, prayed for good
fame; but their request was refused. A ninth company, also of wicked men,
prayed for a famous but evil name, and their request was granted. Among
them was the wretch who set on fire the temple at Athens (1513-1867).

Then some man perceived me, and began to question me. I explained that I
had come to learn strange things, and not to gain fame. He led me out of
the castle and into a valley, where stood the house of Dædalus (i.e. the
house of Rumour). This strange house was made of basket-work, and was full
of holes, and all the doors stood wide open. All sorts of rumours entered
there, and it was sixty miles long. On a rock beside it I saw my eagle
perched, who again seized me, and bore me into it through a window. It
swarmed with people, all of whom were engaged in telling news; and often
their stories would fly out of a window. Sometimes a truth and a lie would
try to fly out together, and became commingled before they could get away.
Every piece of news then flew to Fame, who did as she pleased with each.
The house of Dædalus was thronged with pilgrims, pardoners, couriers, and
messengers, and I heard strange things. In one corner men were telling
stories about love, and there was a crush of men running to hear them. At
last I saw a man whom I knew not; but he seemed to be one who had great
authority--(_here the poem ends, being incomplete_; ll. 1868-2158).

The general idea of the poem was plainly suggested by the description of
Fame in Vergil, the house of Fame as described near the beginning of the
twelfth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses, and various hints in Dante's Divina
Commedia. For a close and searching comparison between the House of Fame
and Dante's great poem, see the article by A. Rambeau in Engl. Studien,
iii. 209.

1. For this method of commencing a poem with a dream, compare The Book of
the Duchesse, Parl. of Foules, and The Romance of the Rose.

For discourses on dreams, compare the Nonne Preestes Tale, and the remarks
of Pandarus in Troilus, v. 358-385. Chaucer here propounds several
problems; first, what causes dreams (a question answered at some length in
the Nonne Preestes Tale, B 4116); why some come true and some do not
(discussed in the same, B 4161); and what are the various sorts of dreams
(see note to l. 7 below).

There is another passage in Le Roman de la Rose, which bears some
resemblance to the present passage. It begins at l. 18699:--

 'Ne ne revoil dire des songes,
  S'il sunt voirs, ou s'il sunt mençonges;
  Se l'en les doit du tout eslire,
  Ou s'il sunt du tout à despire:
  Porquoi li uns sunt plus orribles,
  Plus bel li autre et plus paisible,
  Selonc lor apparicions
  En diverses complexions,
  Et selonc lors divers corages
  Des meurs divers et des aages;
  Ou se Diex par tex visions
  Envoie revelacions,
  Ou li malignes esperiz,
  Por metre les gens en periz;
  De tout ce ne m'entremetrai.'

2. This long sentence ends at line 52.

7. This opens up the question as to the divers sorts of dreams. Chaucer
here evidently follows Macrobius, who, in his Commentary on the Somnium
Scipionis, lib. i. c. 3, distinguishes _five kinds_ of dreams, viz.
_somnium_, _visio_, _oraculum_, _insomnium_, and _visum_. The fourth kind,
_insomnium_, was also called _fantasma_; and this provided Chaucer with the
word _fantome_ in l. 11. In the same line, _oracles_ answers to the Lat.
_oracula_. Cf. Ten Brink, Studien, p. 101.

18. _The gendres_, the (various) kinds. This again refers to Macrobius, who
subdivides the kind of dream which he calls _somnium_ into five species,
viz. _proprium_, _alienum_, _commune_, _publicum_, and _generale_,
according to the things to which they relate. _Distaunce of tymes_, i.e.
whether the thing dreamt of will happen soon, or a long time afterwards.

20. 'Why this is a greater (more efficient) cause than that.'

21. This alludes to the four chief complexions of men; cf. Nonne Preestes
Tale, B 4114. The four complexions were the sanguine, phlegmatic,
melancholy, and choleric; and each complexion was likely to have certain
sorts of dreams. Thus, in the Nonne Preestes Tale, B 4120, the _choleric_
man is said to dream of arrows, fire, fierce carnivorous beasts, strife,
and dogs; whilst the _melancholy_ man will dream of bulls and bears and
black devils.

22. _Reflexiouns_, the reflections or thoughts to which each man is most
addicted; see Parl. of Foules, 99-105.

24. 'Because of too great feebleness of their brain (caused) by
abstinence,' &c.

43. _Of propre kynde_, owing to its own nature.

48. The _y_ in _By_ is run on to the _a_ into _avísióuns_.

53. 'As respects this matter, may good befall the great clerks that treat
of it.' Of these great clerks, Macrobius was one, and Jean de Meun another.
Vincent of Beauvais has plenty to say about dreams in his Speculum
Naturale, lib. xxvi.; and he refers us to Aristotle, Gregory (Moralia, lib.
viii.), Johannes de Rupella, Priscianus (ad Cosdroe regem Persarum)
Augustinus (in Libro de diuinatione dæmonum), Hieronimus (super Matheum,
lib. ii.), Thomas de Aquino, Albertus, &c.

58. Repeated (nearly) from l. 1.

63. I here give the text as restored by Willert, who shows how the
corruptions in ll. 62 and 63 arose. First of all _dide_ was shifted into l.
62, giving _as dide I_; as in Caxton's print. Next, an additional _now_ was
put in place of _dide_ in l. 63; as in P., B., F., and Th., and _dide_ was
dropped alltogether. After this, F. turned the _now_ of l. 64 into _yow_,
and Cx. omitted it. See also note to l. 111.

64. 'Which, as I can (best) now remember.'

68. Pronounced fully:--With spé-ci-ál de-vó-ci-óun.

69. Morpheus; see Book of Duch. 137. From Ovid, Met. xi. 592-612; esp. ll.
602, 3:--

     'Saxo tamen exit ab imo
  Riuus aquae Lethes.'

73. 'Est prope Cimmerios,' &c.; Met. xi. 592.

75. See Ovid, Met. xi. 613-5; 633.

76. _That ... hir_ is equivalent to _whose_; cf. Kn. Tale, 1852.

81. Cf. 'Colui, che tutto move,' i.e. He who moves all; Parad. i. 1.

88. Read _povért_; cf. Clerkes Tale, E 816.

92. MSS. _misdeme_; I read _misdemen_, to avoid an hiatus.

93. Read _málicióus_.

98. 'That, whether he dream when bare-footed or when shod'; whether in bed
by night or in a chair by day; i.e. in every case. The _that_ is
idiomatically repeated in l. 99.

105. The dream of Croesus, king of Lydia, and his death vpon a gallows,
form the subject of the last story in the Monkes Tale. Chaucer got it from
the Rom. de la Rose, which accounts for the form _Lyde_. The passage occurs
at l. 6513:--

              'Cresus ...
  Qui refu roi de toute _Lyde_, ...
  Qu'el vous vuet faire au _gibet_ pendre.'

109, 10. The rime is correct, because _abreyd_ is a _strong_ verb. Chaucer
does not rime a pp. with a _weak_ pt. tense, which should have a final _e_.
According to Mr. Cromie's Rime-Index, there is just _one_ exception, viz.
in the Kn. Tale, A 1383, where the pt. t. _seyde_ is rimed with the 'pp.
_leyde_.' But Mr. Cromie happens to have overlooked the fact that _leyde_
is here _not_ the pp., but the _past tense_! Nevertheless, _abreyd-e_ also
appears in a _weak_ form, by confusion with _leyd-e_, _seyd-e_, &c.; see C.
T., B 4198, E 1061. Cf. Book of the Duchess, 192. In l. 109, he refers to
l. 65.

111. Here again, as in l. 63, is a mention of Dec. 10. Ten Brink (Studien,
p. 151) suggests that it may have been a _Thursday_; cf. the mention of
_Jupiter_ in ll. 608, 642, 661. If so, the year was 1383.

115. 'Like one that was weary with having overwalked himself by going two
miles on pilgrimage.' The difficulty was not in the walking two miles, but
in doing so under difficulties, such as going barefoot for penance.

117. _Corseynt_; O.F. _cors seint_, lit. holy body; hence a saint or
sainted person, or the shrine where a saint was laid. See Robert of Brunne,
Handlyng Synne, 8739:--

 'And hys ymage ful feyre depeynte,
  Ry[gh]t as he were a _cors seynt_.'

See also P. Plowman, B. v. 539; Morte Arthure, 1164; and (the spurious)
Chaucer's Dream, 942.

118. 'To make that soft (or easy) which was formerly hard.' The allusion is
humorous enough; viz. to the bonds of matrimony. Here again Chaucer follows
Jean de Meun, Rom. de la Rose, 8871:--

 'Mariages est maus liens,
  Ainsinc m'aïst saint Juliens
  Qui pelerins errans herberge,
  Et saint Lienart qui defferge
  Les prisonniers bien repentans,
  Quant les voit à soi démentans';

i.e. 'Marriage is an evil bond--so may St. Julian aid me, who harbours
wandering pilgrims; and St. Leonard, who frees from their fetters (lit.
un-irons) such prisoners as are very repentant, when he sees them giving
themselves the lie (or recalling their word).' The 'prisoners' are married
people, who have repented, and would recall their plighted vow.

St. Leonard was the patron-saint of captives, and it was charitably hoped
that he would extend his protection to the wretched people who had
unadvisedly entered into wedlock, and soon prayed to get out of it again.
They would thus exchange the _hard_ bond for the _soft_ condition of
freedom. 'St. Julian is the patron of pilgrims; St. Leonard and St. Barbara
protect captives'; Brand, Pop. Antiquities, i. 359. And, at p. 363 of the
same, Brand quotes from Barnabee Googe:--

 'But Leonerd of the prisoners doth the bandes asunder pull,
  And breaks the prison-doores and chaines, wherewith his church is full.'

St. Leonard's day is Nov. 6.

119. The MSS. have _slept-e_, which is dissyllabic. Read _sleep_, as in C.
T. Prol. 397.

120. Hence the title of one of Lydgate's poems, The Temple of Glass, which
is an imitation of the present poem.

130. Cf. the description of Venus' temple (Cant. Tales, A 1918), which is
imitated from that in Boccaccio's Teseide.

133. Cf. 'naked fleting in the large see.... And on hir heed, ful semely
for to see, A rose garland, fresh and wel smellinge'; Cant. Tales, A 1956.

137. 'Hir dowves'; C. T., A 1962. 'Cupido'; id. 1963.

138. _Vulcano_, Vulcan; note the Italian forms of these names. Boccaccio's
Teseide has _Cupido_ (vii. 54), and _Vulcano_ (vii. 43). His face was brown
with working at the forge.

141, 2. Cf. Dante, Inf. iii. 10, 11.

143. A large portion of the rest of this First Book is taken up with a
summary of the earlier part of Vergil's Aeneid. We have here a translation
of the well-known opening lines:--

 'Arma uirumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
  Italiam, fato profugus, Lauinia uenit
  Littora.'

147. _In_, into, unto; see note to l. 366.

152. _Synoun_, Sinon; Aen. ii. 195.

153. I supply _That_, both for sense and metre.

155. _Made the hors broght_, caused the horse to be brought. On this idiom,
see the note to Man of Lawes Tale, B 171.

158. _Ilioun_, Ilium. _Ilium_ is only a poetical name for Troy; but the
medieval writers often use it in the restricted sense of the citadel of
Troy, where was the temple of Apollo and the palace of Priam. Thus, in the
alliterative Troy-book, 11958, _ylion_ certainly has this sense; and Caxton
speaks of 'the palays of _ylyon_'; see Spec. of English, ed. Skeat, p. 94.
See also the parallel passage in the Nonne Preestes Tale, B 4546. Still
more clearly, in the Leg. Good Women (Dido, 13), Chaucer says, of 'the tour
of Ilioun,' that it 'of the citee was the cheef dungeoun.' In l. 163 below,
it is called _castel_.

160. _Polites_, Polites; Aen. ii. 526. Also spelt _Polite_ in Troil. iv.
53.

163. _Brende_, was on fire; used intransitively, as in l. 537.

164-73. See Aen. ii. 589-733.

174. Read _this_, rather than _his_. Cf. Aen. ii. 736.

177. Iulus and Ascanius were one and the same person; see Æn. i. 267.
Perhaps Ch. was misled by the wording of Æn. iv. 274. (On the other hand,
Brutus was _not_ the same person as Cassius; see Monkes Tale, B 3887).
Hence, Koch proposes to read _That hight_ instead of _And eek_; but we have
no authority for this. However, Chaucer has it right in his Legend of Good
Women, 941; and in l. 192 below, we find _sone_, not _sones_; hence l. 178
may be merely parenthetical.

182. _Wente_, foot-path; Aen. ii. 737. Cf. Book Duch. 398.

184. 'So that she was dead, but I know not how.' Vergil does not say _how_
she died.

185. _Gost_, ghost; see Aen. ii. 772.

189. Repeated from l. 180.

198. Here Chaucer returns to the first book of the Æneid, which he follows
down to l. 255.

204. 'To blow forth, (with winds) of all kinds'; cf. Æn. i. 85.

219. _Ioves_, Jove, Jupiter. This curious form occurs again, ll. 586, 597,
630; see note to l. 586. Boccaccio has _Giove_.

226. _Achatee_ (trisyllabic), Achates, Æn. i. 312; where the abl. form
_Achate_ occurs.

239. The story of Dido is told at length in Le Rom. de la Rose, 13378; in
The Legend of Good Women; and in Gower, Conf. Amantis, bk. iv., ed. Pauli,
ii. 4. Chaucer now passes on to the fourth book of the Æneid, till he comes
to l. 268 below.

265. 'Mès ja ne verrés d'aparence Conclurre bonne consequence'; Rom. Rose,
12343.

272. 'It is not all gold that glistens.' A proverb which Chaucer took from
Alanus de Insulis; see note to Can. Yem. Tale, G 962.

273. 'For, as sure as I hope to have good use of my head.' _Brouke_ is,
practically, in the optative mood. Cf. 'So mote I brouke wel myn eyen
tweye'; Cant. Ta., B 4490; so also E 2308. The phrase occurs several times
in the Tale of Gamelyn; see note to l. 334 of that poem.

280-3. These four lines occur in Thynne's edition only, but are probably
quite genuine. It is easy to see why they dropped out; viz. owing to the
repetition of the word _finde_ at the end of ll. 279 and 283. This is a
very common cause of such omissions. See note to l. 504.

286. _By_, with reference to.

288. _Gest_, guest; Lat. _aduena_, Æn. iv. 591.

290. 'He that fully knows the herb may safely lay it to his eye.' So in
Cotgrave's Dict., s.v. _Herbe_, we find; '_L'herbe qu'on cognoist, on la
doit lier à son doigt_; Prov. Those, or that, which a man knowes best, he
must use most.'

305. In the margin of MSS. F. and B. is here written:--'Cauete uos,
innocentes mulieres.'

315. _Swete herte_; hence E. _sweetheart_; cf. l. 326.

321. Understand _ne_ (i.e. neither) before _your love_. Cf. Æn. iv. 307, 8.

329. I have no hesitation in inserting _I_ after _Agilte_, as it is
absolutely required to complete the sense. Read--_Agílt' I yów_, &c.

343. Pronounce _détermínen_ (_i_ as _ee_ in _beet_).

346. Cf. Æn. iv. 321-3.

350. 'Fama, malum quo non aliud _uelocius_ ullum,' Æn. iv. 174; quoted in
the margin of MSS. F. and B.

351. 'Nichil occultum quod non reueletur'; Matt. x. 26: quoted in the
margin of MSS. F. and B.

355. _Seyd y-shamed be_, said to be put to shame.

359. _Eft-sones_, hereafter again. In the margin of MSS. F. and B. we here
find:--'Cras poterunt turpia fieri sicut heri.' By reading _fieri turpia_,
this becomes a pentameter; but it is not in Ovid, nor (I suppose) in
classical Latin.

361. _Doon_, already done. _To done_, yet to be done. Cf. Book Duch. 708.

366. I read _in_ for _into_ (as in the MSS.). For similar instances, where
the scribes write _into_ for _in_, see Einenkel, Streifzüge durch die
Mittelengl. Syntax, p. 145. Cf. l. 147.

367. In the margin of MSS. F. and B. is an incorrect quotation of Æn. iv.
548-9:--'tu prima furentem His, germana, malis oneras.'

378. _Eneidos_; because the books are headed _Æneidos liber primus_, &c.

379. See Ovid, Heroides, Epist. vii--Dido Æneæ.

380. _Or that_, ere that, before.

381. Only Th. has the right reading, viz. _And nere it to longe to endyte_
(where _longe_ is an error for _long_). The expressions _And nor hyt were_
and _And nere it were_ are both ungrammatical. _Nere_ = _ne were_, were it
not.

388. In the margin of F. and B. we find:--'Nota: of many vntrewe louers.
Hospita, Demaphoon, tua te R[h]odopeia Phyllis Vltra promissum tempus
abesse queror.' These are the first two lines of Epistola ii. in Ovid's
_Heroides_, addressed by Phyllis to Demophoon. All the examples here given
are taken from the same work. Epist. iii. is headed _Briseis Achilli_;
Epist. v., _Oenone Paridi_; Epist. vi., _Hypsipyle Iasoni_; Epist. xii.,
_Medea Iasoni_; Epist. ix., _Deianira Herculi_; Epist. x., _Ariadne
Theseo_. These names were evidently suggested by the reference above to the
same work, l. 379. See the long note to Group B, l. 61, in vol. v.

Demophoon, son of Theseus, was the lover of Phyllis, daughter of king
Sithon in Thrace; she was changed into an almond-tree.

392. _His terme pace_, pass beyond or stay behind his appointed time. He
said he would return in a month, but did not do so. See the story in The
Legend of Good Women. Gower (ed. Pauli, iii. 361) alludes to her story, in
a passage much like the present one; and in Le Rom. de la Rose, 13417, we
have the very phrase--'Por _le terme qu'il trespassa_.'

397. In the margin of F. and B.:--'Ouidius. Quam legis a rapta Briseide
litera venit'; Heroid. Ep. iii. 1.

401. In the same:--'Ut [_miswritten_ Vbi] tibi Colc[h]orum memini regina
uacaui'; Heroid. Ep. xii. 1. For the accentuation of _Medea_, cf. Leg. of
Good Women, 1629, 1663.

402. In the margin of F. and B.:--'Gratulor Oechaliam'; Heroid. Ep. ix. 1;
but _Oechaliam_ is miswritten _yotholia_.

405. Gower also tells this story; ed. Pauli, ii. 306.

407. In F. and B. is quoted the first line of Ovid, Heroid. x. 1.
_Adriane_, Ariadne; just as in Leg. Good Wom. 2171, &c., and in C. T.,
Group B, l. 67. Gower has _Adriagne_.

409. 'For, whether he had laughed, or whether he had frowned'; i.e. in any
case. Cf. l. 98.

411. 'If it had not been for Ariadne.' We have altered the form of this
idiom.

416. _Yle_, isle of Naxos; see notes to Leg. Good Wom. 2163, and C. T.,
Group B, l. 68 (in vol. v.).

426. _Telles_ is a Northern and West-Midland form, as in Book Duch. 73. Cf.
_falles_, id. 257. A similar admixture of forms occurs in Havelok, Will. of
Palerne, and other M.E. poems.

429. _The book_, i.e. Vergil; Æn. iv. 252.

434. _Go_, gone, set out; correctly used. Chaucer passes on to Æneid, bk.
v. The _tempest_ is that mentioned in Æn. v. 10; the _steersman_ is
Palinurus, who fell overboard; Æn. v. 860.

439. See Æn. bk. vi. The _isle_ intended is Crete, Æn. vi. 14, 23; which
was not at all near (or 'besyde') Cumæ, but a long way from it. Æneas then
descends to hell, where he sees Anchises (vi. 679); Palinurus (337); Dido
(450); Deiphobus, son of Priam (495); and the tormented souls (580).

447. _Which_ refers to the various sights in hell.

449. _Claudian_, Claudius Claudianus, who wrote De raptu Proserpinae about
A.D. 400. _Daunte_ is Dante, with reference to his Inferno, ii. 13-27, and
Paradiso, xv. 25-27.

451. Chaucer goes on to Æn. vii-xii, of which he says but little.

458. _Lavyna_ is Lavinia; the form _Lavina_ occurs in Dante, Purg. xvii.
37.

468. I put _seyën_ for _seyn_, to improve the metre; cf. P. Pl. C. iv. 104.

474. 'But I do not know who caused them to be made.'

475. Read _ne in_ as _nin_; as in Squi. Tale, F 35.

482. This waste space corresponds to Dante's 'gran diserto,' Inf. i. 64;
or, still better, to his 'landa' (Inf. xiv. 8), which was too sterile to
support plants. So again, l. 486 corresponds to Dante's 'arena arida e
spessa,' which has reference to the desert of Libya; Inf. xiv. 13.

487. 'As fine [said of the sand] as one may see still lying.' Jephson says
_yet_ must be a mistake, and would read _yt_. But it makes perfect sense.
Cx. Th. read _at eye_ (put for _at yë_) instead of _yet lye_, which is
perhaps better. _At yë_ means 'as presented to the sight'; see Kn. Ta., A
3016.

498. _Kenne_, discern. The offing at sea has been called the _kenning_; and
see _Kenning_ in Halliwell.

500. _More_, greater. Imitated from Dante, Purgat. ix. 19, which Cary
translates thus:--

 'Then, in a vision, did I seem to view
  A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,
  With open wings, and hovering for descent.'

Cf. also the descent of the angel in Purg. ii. 17-24.

504-7. The omission of these lines in F. and B. is simply due to the scribe
slipping from _bright_ in l. 503 to _brighte_ in l. 507. Cf. note to l.
280.


BOOK II.

511. _Listeth_, pleases, is pleased; the alteration (in MS. F.) to
_listeneth_ is clearly wrong, and due to confusion with _herkneth_ above.
(I do not think _listeth_ is the imp. pl. here.)

514. _Isaye_, Isaiah; actually altered, in various editions, to _I saye_,
as if it meant 'I say.' The reference is to 'the vision of Isaiah'; Isa. i.
1; vi. 1. _Scipioun_, Scipio; see note to Parl. Foules, 31, and cf. Book of
the Duch. 284.

515. _Nabugodonosor_, Nebuchadnezzar. The same spelling occurs in the
Monkes Tale (Group B, 3335), and is a mere variant of the form
_Nabuchodonosor_ in the Vulgate version, Dan. i-iv. Gower has the same
spelling; Conf. Amant. bk. i., near the end.

516. _Pharo_; spelt _Pharao_ in the Vulgate, Gen. xli. 1-7. See Book of the
Duchesse, 280-3.

_Turnus_; alluding to his vision of Iris, the messenger of Juno; Æneid ix.
6. _Elcanor_; this name somewhat resembles _Elkanah_ (in the Vulgate,
_Elcana_), 1 Sam. i. 1; but I do not know where to find any account of his
vision, nor do I at all understand who is meant. The name _Alcanor_ occurs
in Vergil, but does not help us.

518. _Cipris_, Venus, goddess of Cyprus; called _Cipryde_ in Parl. Foules,
277. Dante has _Ciprigna_; Par. viii. 2.

519. _Favour_, favourer, helper, aid; not used in the ordinary sense of
Lat. _fauor_, but as if it were formed from O.F. _faver_, Lat. _fauere_, to
be favourable to. Godefroy gives an example of the O.F. verb _faver_ in
this sense.

521. _Parnaso_; the spelling is imitated from the Ital. _Parnaso_, i.e.
Parnassus, in Dante, Par. i. 16. So also _Elicon_ is Dante's _Elicona_,
i.e. Helicon, Purg. xxix. 40. But the passage in Dante which Chaucer here
especially imitates is that in Inf. ii. 7-9:--

 'O Muse, o alto ingegno, or m' aiutate;
  O mente, che scrivesti ciò ch' io vidi,
  Qui si parrà la tua nobilitate.'

This Cary thus translates:--

 'O Muses! O high genius, now vouchsafe
  Your aid. O mind, that all I saw hast kept
  Safe in a written record, here thy worth
  And eminent endowments come to proof.'

Hence _ye_ in l. 520 answers to Dante's _Muse_, the Muses; and _Thought_ in
l. 523 answers to Dante's _mente_, Cf. also Parad. xviii. 82-87. And see
the parallel passage in Anelida, 15-19.

The reason why Chaucer took _Helicon_ to be a well rather than a mountain
is because Dante's allusion to it is dubiously worded; see Purg. xxix. 40.

528. _Engyn_ is accented on the latter syllable, as in Troil. ii. 565, iii.
274.

529. _Egle_, the eagle in l. 499; cf. ll. 503-7.

534. Partly imitated from Dante, Purg. ix. 28-30:--

 'Poi mi parea che, più rotata un poco,
  Terribil come fulgor discendesse,
  E me rapisse suso infino al foco.'

Cary's translation is:--

 'A little wheeling in his aëry tour,
  Terrible as the lightning, rushed he down,
  And snatch'd me upward even to the fire.'

But Chaucer follows still more closely, and verbally, a passage in
Machault's Jugement du Roi de Navarre, ed. Tarbé, 1849, p. 72, which has
the words--

                       'la foudre
  Que mainte ville mist en poudre';

i.e. literally, 'the _foudre_ (thunder-bolt) which reduces many a town to
powder.' Machault nearly repeats this; ed. Tarbé, p. 97.

Curiously enough, almost the same words occur in Boethius, bk. i. met. 4,
where Chaucer's translation has:--'ne þe wey of thonder-leyt, that is wont
to smyten heye toures.' It hence appears that Chaucer copies Machault, and
Machault translates Boethius. There are some curious M.E. verses on the
effects of thunder in Popular Treatises on Science, ed. Wright, p. 136.

_Foudre_ represents the Lat. _fulgur_. One of the queer etymologies of
medieval times is, that _fulgur_ is derived _a feriendo_; Vincent of
Beauvais, Spec. Nat. iv. 59. It was held to be quite sufficient that both
_fulgur_ and _ferire_ begin with _f_.

537. _Brende,_ was set on fire; cf. l. 163. The idea is that of a falling
thunderbolt, which seems to have been conceived of as being a material
mass, set on fire by the rapidity of its passage through the air; thus
confusing the flash of lightning with the fall of a meteoric stone. See Mr.
Aldis Wright's note on _thunder-stone_, Jul. Cæs. i. 3. 49.

543. _Hente_, caught. We find a similar use of the word in an old
translation of Map's Apocalypsis Goliæ, printed in Morley's Shorter Eng.
Poems, p. 13:--

 'And by and by I fell into a sudden trance,
  And all along the air was marvellously _hent_.'

544. _Sours_, sudden ascent, a springing aloft. It is well illustrated by a
passage in the Somp. Tale (D 1938):--

 'Therfor, right as an hauk up, at a _sours_,
  Up springeth into their, right so prayeres
  Of charitable and chaste bisy freres
  Maken hir _sours_ to Goddes eres two.'

It is precisely the same word as M.E. _sours_, mod. E. _source_, i.e. rise,
spring (of a river). Etymologically, it is the feminine of O.F. _sors_, pp.
of _sordre_, to rise (Lat. _surgere_). At a later period, the _r_ was
dropped, and the word was strangely confused in sound with the verb
_souse_, to pickle. Moreover, the original sense of 'sudden ascent' was
confused with that of 'sudden descent,' for which the correct term was (I
suppose) _swoop_. Hence the old verb to _souse_, in the sense 'to swoop
down,' or 'to pounce upon,' or 'to strike,' as in Shak. K. John, v. 2. 150;
Spenser, F. Q. i. 5. 8; iii. 4. 16; iv. 3. 19. 25; iv. 4. 30; iv 5. 36; iv.
7. 9. The sense of 'downward swoop' is particularly clear in Spenser, F. Q.
ii. 11. 36:--

 'Eft fierce retourning, as a faulcon fayre,
  That once hath failed of her _souse_ full neare,
  Remounts againe into the open ayre,
  And unto better fortune doth her-selfe prepayre.'

Such is the simple solution of the etymology of Mod. E. _souse_, as used by
Pope (Epilogue to Satires, Dial. ii. 15)--'Spread thy broad wing, and
_souse_ on all the kind.'

557. Cf. Dante, Inf. ii. 122:--'Perchè tanta viltà nel core allette?' Also
Purg. ix. 46:--'Non aver tema.'

562. 'One that I could name.' This personal allusion can hardly refer to
any one but Chaucer's wife. The familiar tone recalls him to himself; yet
the eagle's voice sounded kindly, whereas the poet sadly tells us that his
wife's voice sounded far otherwise: 'So was it never wont to be.' See
Ward's Chaucer, pp. 84, 85; and cf. l. 2015 below. Perhaps Chaucer disliked
to hear the word 'Awak!'

573. It would appear that, in Chaucer, _sëynt_ is sometimes dissyllabic;
but it may be better here to use the feminine form _seynt-e_, as in l.
1066. Observe the rime of _Márie_ with _cárie_.

576. 'For so certainly may God help me, as thou shall have no harm.'

586. _Ioves_, Jove, Jupiter; cf. l. 597. This remarkable form occurs again
in Troil. ii. 1607, where we find the expression '_Ioves_ lat him never
thryve'; and again in Troil. iii. 3--'O _Ioves_ doughter dere'; and in
Troil. iii. 15, where _Ioves_ is in the accusative case. The form is that
of an O.F. nominative; cf. _Charles_, _Jacques_, _Jules_.

_Stellifye_, make into a constellation; 'whether will Jupiter turn me into
a constellation.' This alludes, of course, to the numerous cases in which
it was supposed that such heroes as Hercules and Perseus, or such heroines
as Andromeda and Callisto were changed into constellations: see Kn. Tale, A
2058. Cf. 'No wonder is thogh Iove hir stellifye'; Leg. Good Women, prol.
525. Skelton uses the word (Garland of Laurell, 963); and it is given in
Palsgrave.

588. Perhaps imitated from Dante, Inf. ii. 32, where Dante says that he is
neither Æneas nor Paul. Chaucer here refers to various men who were borne
up to heaven, viz. Enoch (Gen. v. 24), Elijah (2 Kings ii. 11), Romulus,
and Ganymede. Romulus was carried up to heaven by Mars; Ovid, Metam. xiv.
824; Fasti, ii. 475-512. Ganymede was carried up to heaven by Jupiter in
the form of an eagle; cf. Vergil, Æn. i. 28, and see Ovid, Metam. x. 160,
where Ovid adds:

             'qui nunc quoque pocula miscet,
  Invitaque Iovi nectar Iunone ministrat.'

In the passage in Dante (Purg. ix. 19-30), already alluded to above (note
to l. 534), there is a reference to Ganymede (l. 23).

592. _Boteler_, butler. No burlesque is here intended. 'The idea of
Ganymede being _butler_ to the gods appears ludicrous to us, who are
accustomed to see the office performed by menial servants. But it was not
so in the middle ages. Young gentlemen of high rank carved the dishes and
poured out the wine at the tables of the nobility, and grace in the
performance of these duties was highly prized. One of the oldest of our
noble families derives its surname from the fact that its founder was
_butler_ to the king'; Bell. So also, the royal name of _Stuart_ is merely
_steward_.

597. _Therabout_, busy about, having it in intention.

600-4. Cf. Vergil's words of reassurance to Dante; Inf. ii. 49.

608. The eagle says he is Jupiter's eagle; 'Iouis ales,' Æn. i. 394.

614-40. A long sentence of 27 lines.

618. I supply _goddesse_, to complete the line. Cf. 'In worship of Venús,
goddésse of love'; Kn. Tale, A 1904; and again, 'goddésse,' id. A 1101, 2.

621. The necessity for correcting _lytel_ to _lyte_ is obvious from the
rime, since _lyte is_ rimes with _dytees_. Chaucer seems to make _lyte_
dissyllabic; it rimes with _Arcite_, Kn. Ta., A 1334, 2627; and with
_hermyte_ in l. 659 below. In the present case, the _e_ is
elided--_lyt'is_. For similar rimes, cf. _nones_, _noon is_, C. T. Prol.
523; _beryis_, _mery is_, Non. Pr. Ta., B 4155; _swevenis_, _swevene is_,
id. B 4111.

623. In a note to Cant. Ta. 17354 (I 43), Tyrwhitt says that perhaps
_cadence_ means 'a species of poetical composition distinct from riming
verses.' But it is difficult to shew that Chaucer ever composed anything of
the kind, unless it can be said that his translation of Boethius or his
Tale of Melibeus is in a sort of rhythmical prose. It seems to me just
possible that by _rime_ may here be meant the ordinary riming of two lines
together, as in the Book of the Duchess and the House of Fame, whilst by
_cadence_ may be meant lines disposed in stanzas, as in the Parliament of
Foules. There is nothing to shew that Chaucer had, at this period, employed
the 'heroic verse' of the Legend of Good Women. However, we find the
following quotation from Jullien in Littré's Dictionary, s.v.
_Cadence_:--'Dans la prose, dans les vers, la cadence n'est pas autre chose
que le rhythme ou le nombre: seulement on y joint ordinairement l'idée
d'une certaine douceur dans le style, d'un certain art dans l'arrangement
des phrases ou dans le choix des mots que le rhythme proprement dit ne
suppose pas du tout.' This is somewhat oracular, as it is difficult to see
why _rhythm_ should not mean much the same thing.

637. 'And describest everything that relates to them.' (Here _hir_ =
their), with reference to lovers.

639-40. 'Although thou mayst accompany those whom he is not pleased to
assist.' Nearly repeated in Troilus, i. 517, 518.

652. In a note upon the concluding passage of the Cant. Tales, Tyrwhitt
says of the House of Fame:--'Chaucer mentions this among his works in the
Leg. Good Women, verse 417. He wrote it while he was Comptroller of the
Custom of Wools, &c. (see Bk. ii. l. 144-8 [the present passage]), and
consequently after the year 1374.' See Ward's Chaucer, pp. 76, 77, with its
happy reference to Charles Lamb and his 'works'; and compare a similar
passage in the Prol. to Legend of Good Women, 30-6.

662. Cf. Dante, Inf. i. 113, which Cary thus translates:--

                        --'and I, thy guide,
  Will lead thee hence through an eternal space.'

678. _Long y-served_, faithfully served for a long time, i.e. after a long
period of devotion; alluding to the word _servant_ in the sense of lover.

681. Alluding to sudden fallings in love, especially 'at first sight.' Such
take place at haphazard; as if a blind man should accidentally frighten a
hare, without in the least intending it. We find in Hazlitt's collection of
Proverbs--'The hare starts when a man least expects it'; p. 373.

682. _Iolytee and fare_, happiness and good speed. The very same words are
employed, but ironically, by Theseus in the Knight's Tale, A 1807, 1809.
The _hare_ also accompanies them; id. A 1810.

683. 'As long as they find love to be as true as steel.' Cf. Troilus, iv.
325:--'God leve that ye finde ay love of steel.'

689. 'And more beards made in two hours,' &c. 'Yet can a miller make a
clerkes berd'; (Reves Tale), C. T., A 4096. 'Yet coude I make his berd'; C.
T., D 361. Tyrwhitt's note on the former passage is: '_make a clerkes
berd_,' i.e. cheat him. _Faire la barbe_ is to _shave_, or _trim_ the
beard; but Chaucer translates the phrase literally, at least when he uses
it in its metaphorical sense. Boccace has the same metaphor, Decamerone,
viii. 10. Speaking of some exorbitant cheats, he says that they applied
themselves 'non a radere, ma a scorticare huomini' [not to shave men, but
to scarify them]; and a little lower--'si a soavemente _la barbiera_ saputo
menare il rasoio' [so agreeably did the she-barber know how to handle the
razor]. _Barbiera_ has a second and a bad sense; see Florio's Dictionary.

 'Myght I thaym have spyde,
  I had _made thaym a berd_.'
                      Towneley Mysteries, p. 144.

692. _Holding in hond_ means keeping in hand, attaching to oneself by
feigned favours; just as _to bear in hand_ used to mean to make one believe
a thing; see my note to Man of Lawes Tale, B 620.

695. _Lovedayes_, appointed days of reconciliation; see note in vol. v. to
Chaucer's Prol. 258, and my note to P. Plowman, B. iii. 157. 'What, quod
she, maked I not a _louedaie_ bitwene God and mankind, and chese a maide to
be nompere [umpire], to put the quarell at ende?' Test. of Love, bk. i. ed.
1561, fol. 287.

696. _Cordes_, chords. Apparently short for _acordes_, i.e. musical chords,
as Willert suggests. It is rather a forced simile, like _cornes_ in l. 698.

698. _Cornes_, grains of corn; see note to Monkes Tale (Group B, 3225).

700. _Wis_, certainly; cf. _y-wis_. The _i_ is short.

702. _Impossíble_, (accent on _i_); cf. Clerkes Tale, E 713.

703. _Pyes_, mag-pies, chattering birds; Squi. Ta., F 650.

708. _Worthy for to leve_, worthy to believe, worthy of belief.

712. _Thyn owne book_, i.e. the book you are so fond of, viz. Ovid's
Metamorphoses, which Chaucer quotes so continually. Libraries in those days
were very small (Cant. Ta. Prol. 294); but we may be almost certain that
Chaucer had a copy of the Metamorphoses of his own. The reference here is
to Ovid's description of the House of Fame, Metam. xii. 39-63. See
Golding's translation of this passage in the Introduction.

730. This passage is founded on one in Boethius; cf. Chaucer's translation,
bk. iii. pr. 11, ll. 98-110. Imitated also in Le Rom. de la Rose, 16963-9.
Cf. Dante, Par. i. 109, which Cary thus translates:--

           'All natures lean,
  In this their order, diversely,' &c.

738. _That_ practically goes with _hit falleth doun_, in l. 741. The
sentence is ill-constructed, and not consistent with grammar, but we see
what is meant.

742. _By_, with reference to (as usual in M. E). Cf. Dante, Purg. xviii.
28, which Cary thus translates:--

 'Then, as the fire points up, and mounting seeks
  His birth-place and his lasting seat,' &c.

745. _At his large_, unrestrained, free to move. Cf. _at thy large_, Cant.
Ta., A 1283, 1292.

746. _Charge_, a heavy weight, opposed to _light thing_. The verb _seke_ is
understood from l. 744. 'A light thing (seeks to go) up, and a weight
(tends) downwards.' In Tyrwhitt's glossary, the word _charge_, in this
passage, is described as being a verb, with the sense 'to weigh, to incline
on account of weight.' How this can be made to suit the context, I cannot
understand. _Charge_ occurs as a sb. several times in Chaucer, but chiefly
with the secondary sense of 'importance'; see Kn. Tale, A 1284, 2287; Can.
Yem. Ta., G 749. In the Clerkes Tale, E 163, it means 'weight,' nearly as
here.

750. _Skilles_, reasons. The above 'reasons' prove nothing whatever as
regards the fish in the sea, or the trees in the earth; but the eagle's
mode of reasoning must not be too closely enquired into. The fault is not
Chaucer's, but arises from the extremely imperfect state of science in the
middle ages. Chaucer had to accept the usual account of the four elements,
disposed, according to their weight, in four layers; earth being at the
bottom, then water, then air, and lastly fire above the air. See the whole
scheme in Gower, Conf. Amant. bk. vii.; ed. Pauli, ii. 104: or Popular
Treatises on Science, ed. Wright, p. 134.

752. See Chaucer's tr. of Boethius, bk. iii. pr. 11, l. 72. Hence Boethius
is one of the 'clerkes' referred to in l. 760.

759. Dante mentions these two; Inf. iv. 131-4.

765. So also in Cant. Tales, D 2233:--

                       'every soun
  Nis but of eir reverberacioun,
  And ever it wasteth lyte and lyte awey.'

The theory of sound is treated of in Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum
Naturale, lib. iv. c. 14. The ancients seem to have understood that sound
is due to the vibration of the air; see ll. 775, 779. Thus, in the treatise
by Boethius, De Musica (to which Chaucer expressly refers in Non. Preest.
Tale, B 4484), lib. i. c. 3, I find:--'Sonus vero præter quendam pulsum
percussionemque non redditur.... Idcirco definitur sonus, aeris percussio
indissoluta usque ad auditum.'

788. _Experience_, i.e. experiment. The illustration is a good one; I have
no doubt that it is obtained, directly or at secondhand, from Boethius.
Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. Nat. lib. xxv. c. 58, says:--'Ad quod
demonstrandum inducit idem Boetius tale exemplum: Lapis proiectus in medio
stagni facit breuissimum circulum, et ille alium, et hoc fit donec vel ad
ripas peruenerit vel impetus defecerit.' This merely gives the substance of
what he says; it will be of interest to quote the original passage, from
the treatise De Musica, lib. i. c. 14, which chapter I quote in full:--

'Nunc quis modus sit audiendi disseramus. Tale enim quiddam fieri consuevit
in uocibus, quale cum paludibus uel quietis aquis iactum eminus mergitur
saxum. Prius enim in paruissimum orbem undam colligit, deinde maioribus
orbibus, undarum globos spargit, atque eo usque dum fatigatus motus ab
eliciendis fluctibus conquiescat. Semperque posterior et maior undula pulsu
debiliori diffunditur. Quod si quid sit, quod crescentes undulas possit
offendere, statim motus ille reuertitur, et quasi ad centrum, unde
profectus fuerat, eisdem undulis rotundatur. Ita igitur cum aer pulsus
fecerit sonum, pellit alium proximum, et quodammodo rotundum fluctum aeris
ciet. Itaque diffunditur et omnium circunstantium (_sic_) simul ferit
auditum, atque illi est obscurior uox, qui longius steterit, quoniam ad eum
debilior pulsi aeris unda peruenit.'

792. _Covercle_, a pot-lid. Cotgrave cites the proverb--'_Tel pot tel
couvercle_, Such pot, such potlid, like master, like man.'

794. _Wheel_ must have been glossed by _cercle_ (circle) in an early copy;
hence MSS. F. and B. have the reading--'That whele sercle wol cause another
whele,' where the gloss has crept into the text.

798. _Roundel_, a very small circle; _compas_, a very large circle.
_Roundel_ is still a general term for a small circular charge in heraldry;
if _or_ (golden), it is called a _bezant_; if _argent_ (white), it is
called a _plate_; and so on. In the Sec. Non. Tale, G 45, _compas_ includes
the whole world.

801. _Multiplying_, increasing in size.

805. 'Where you do not observe the motion above, it is still going on
underneath.' This seems to allude to some false notion as to a transmission
of motion below the surface.

808. This is an easy way of getting over a difficulty. It is no easy task
to prove the contrary of every false theory!

811. _An air aboute_, i.e. a surrounding layer, or hollow sphere, of air.

822. I would rather 'take it in game'; and so I accept it.

826. _Fele_, experience, understand by experiment.

827. I here take the considerable liberty of reading _the mansioun_, by
comparison with l. 831. Those who prefer to read _sum place stide_, or _som
styde_, or _some stede_, can do so! The sense intended is obviously--'And
that the dwelling-place, to which each thing is inclined to resort, has its
own natural stead,' i.e. position. Fishes, for example, naturally exist in
_water_; the trees, upon the _earth_; and sounds, in the _air_; water,
earth, air, and fire being the four 'elements.' Cf. the phrase--'to be in
his _element_.'

836. _Out of_, i.e. not in; answering to l. 838.

846. Referring to Ovid's description, Met. xii. 39, 40.

 'Orbe locus medio est inter terrasque fretumque
  Coelestesque plagas, triplicis confinia mundi.'

I suspect that Ovid's _triplicis confinia mundi_ is the origin of Chaucer's
phrase _tryne compas_, in Sec. Non. Tale, G 45.

857. The 'terms of philosophy' are all fully and remorselessly given by
Gower, Conf. Amant. bk. vii.

861. It is remarkable that Chaucer, some years later, repeated almost the
same thing in the Prologue to his Treatise on the Astrolabe, in somewhat
different words, viz. 'curious endyting and hard sentence is full hevy
atones for swich a child to lerne'; l. 32.

866. _Lewedly_, in unlearned fashion; in his Astrolabe, l. 43, Chaucer says
he is 'but a _lewd_ compilatour of the labour of olde Astrologiens.'

868. The eagle characteristically says that his reasons are so 'palpable,'
that they can be shaken by the _bills_, as men shake others by the hand. It
is perhaps worth adding that the word _bill_ was too vulgar and familiar to
be applied to a hawk, which had only a _beak_ (the French term, whereas
_bill_ is the A.S. _bile_). 'Ye shall say, this hauke has a large _beke_,
or a shortt beke; and call it not _bille_'; Book of St. Alban's, fol. a 6,
back. The eagle purposely employs the more familiar term.

873. Chaucer meekly allows that the eagle's explanation is a _likely_ one.
He was not in a comfortable position for contradiction in argument, and so
took a wiser course. The eagle resents this mild admission, and says he
will soon find out the truth, 'top, and tail, and every bit.' He then eases
his mind by soaring 'upper,' resumes his good temper, and proposes to speak
'all of game.'

888. Cf. Dante, Par. xxii. 128, which Cary thus translates:

 'Look downward, and contemplate, what a world
  Already stretch'd under our feet there lies.'

900. _Unethes_, with difficulty; because large animals could only just be
discerned. The graphic touches here are excellent.

901. _Rivér-es_, with accent on the former _e_ (pronounced as _a_ in
_bare_). Cf. Ital. _riviera_.

907. _Prikke_, a point. 'Al the environinge of the erthe aboute ne halt nat
but the resoun of a _prikke_ at regard of the greetnesse of hevene'; tr. of
Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 7. 17.

 'And doun fro thennes faste he gan avyse
  This litel spot of erthe, that with the see
  Enbraced is';
                                 Troilus, bk. v. ll. 1814-6.

                   'Vidi questo globo
  Tal, ch' io sorriso del suo vil sembiante.'
                                 Dante, Parad. xxii. 134.

See also Parl. Foules, 57, 58; and note that the above passage from Troilus
is copied from the Teseide (xi. 2).

915. The note in Gilman's Chaucer as to Alexander's _dreams_ is entirely
beside the mark. The word _dreme_ (l. 917) refers to Scipio only. The
reference is to the wonderful mode in which Alexander contrived to soar in
the air in a car upborne by four gigantic griffins.

 'Now is he won þur[gh]e þar wingis vp to the wale cloudis;
  So hi[gh]e to heuen þai him hale in a hand-quile,
  Midil-erth bot as a mylnestane, na mare, to him semed.'
             Wars of Alexander, ed. Skeat (E.E.T.S.), 5523.

_Macedo_, the Macedonian.

916. _King_, kingly hero; not king in the strict sense. _Dan Scipio_, lord
Scipio. See notes to Parl. Foules, 29; Book of the Duch. 284; Ho. Fame,
514.

917. _At point devys_, with great exactness; see Rom. Rose, 830, 1215.

919. _Dedalus_ (i.e. Dædalus) and _Ycarus_ (Icarus) are mentioned in the
Rom. de la Rose, 5242; and cf. Gower, Conf. Amant. bk. iv., ed. Pauli, ii.
36; and Dante, Inf. xvii. 109. All take the story from Ovid, Metam. viii.
183. Dædalus constructed wings for himself and his son Icarus, and flew
away from Crete. The latter flew too high, and the sun melted the wax with
which some of the feathers were fastened, so that he fell into the sea and
was drowned. Hence Dædalus is here called _wrecche_, i.e. miserable,
because he lost his son; and Icarus _nyce_, i.e. foolish, because he
disobeyed his father's advice, not to fly too high.

922. _Malt_, melted. Gower has the same word in the same story; ed. Pauli,
ii. 37.

925. Cf. Dante, Par. xxii. 19, which Cary thus translates:

 'But elsewhere now I bid thee turn thy view.'

930. See note to l. 986 below, where the original passage is given.

931. This line seems to refer solely to the word _citizein_ in l. 930. The
note in Bell's Chaucer says: 'This appears to be an allusion to Plato's
Republic.' But it was probably suggested by the word _respublica_ in Alanus
(see note to l. 986).

932. _Eyrish bestes_, aerial animals; alluding to the signs of the zodiac,
such as the Ram, Bull, Lion, Goat, Crab, Scorpion, &c.; and to other
constellations, such as the Great Bear, Eagle, Swan, Pegasus, &c. Chaucer
himself explains that the 'zodiak is cleped the cercle of the signes, or
the cercle of the _bestes_; for _zodia_ in langage of Greek sowneth
_bestes_ in Latin tonge'; Astrolabe, Part 1, § 21, 1. 37. Cf. 'beasts' in
Rev. iv. 6. The phrase recurs in l. 965 below; see also ll. 1003-7.

934. _Goon_, march along, walk on, like the Ram or Bull; _flee_, fly like
the Eagle or Swan. He alludes to the apparent revolution of the heavens
round the earth.

936. _Galaxye_, galaxy, or milky way, formed by streaks of closely crowded
stars; already mentioned in the Parl. of Foules, 56; see note to the same,
l. 50. Cary, in a note to Dante, Parad. xxv. 18, says that Dante, in the
Convito, p. 74, speaks of _la galassia_--'the galaxy, that is, the white
circle which the common people call the way of St. James'; on which
Biscioni remarks:--'The common people formerly considered the milky way as
a sign by night to pilgrims, who were going to St. James of Galicia; and
this perhaps arose from the resemblance of the word _galaxy_ to _Galicia_;
[which may be doubted]. I have often,' he adds, 'heard women and peasants
call it the Roman road, _la strada di Roma_.'

The fact is simply, that the Milky Way looks like a sort of road or street;
hence the Lat. name _uia lactea_, as in Ovid, Metam. i. 168. Hence also the
Roman peasants called it _strada di Roma_; the pilgrims to Spain called it
_the road to Santiago_ (Quarterly Review, Oct. 1873, p. 464); and the
English called it the _Walsingham way_, owing to this being a route much
frequented by pilgrims, or else _Watling-street_, which was a famous old
road, and probably ran (not as usually said, from Kent to Cardigan Bay,
but) from Kent to the Frith of Forth; see Annals of England, p. 6. The name
of _Vatlant Streit_ (Watling Street) is given to the milky way in the
Complaint of Scotland, ed. Murray, p. 58; and G. Douglas calls it _Watling
Streit_ in his translation of Vergil, Æn. iii. 516, though there is no
mention of it in the original; see Small's edition of the Works of G.
Douglas, vol. ii. p. 151. And again, it is called _Wadlyng Strete_ in
Henrysoun's Traite of Orpheus; see Jamieson's Scottish Dictionary. So also:
'Galaxia, that is Watling-Strete'; Batman on Bartholome, lib. viii. c. 33.
See my note to P. Plowman, C. i. 52; Florence of Worcester, _sub anno_
1013; Laws of Edward the Confessor, cap. 12; Towneley Myst., p. 308; Cutts,
Scenes, &c. of the Middle Ages, p. 178; Grimm's Mythology, tr. by
Stallybras, i. 357.

942. Gower also relates this story (Conf. Amant. ii. 34), calling the sun
_Phebus_, and his son _Pheton_, and using _carte_ in the sense of
'chariot,' as Chaucer does. Both copy from Ovid, Metam. ii. 32-328.

944. _Cart-hors_, chariot-horses (plural). There were four horses, named
Pyroeïs, Eous, Aethon, and Phlegon; Met. ii. 153. Hence _gonne_ and _beren_
are in the plural form; cf. l. 952.

948. _Scorpioun_, the well-known zodiacal constellation and sign; called
_Scorpius_ in Ovid, Met. ii. 196.

972. _Boece_, Boethius. He refers to the passage which he himself thus
translates: 'I have, forsothe, swifte fetheres that surmounten the heighte
of the hevene. Whan the swifte thought hath clothed it-self in tho
fetheres, it dispyseth the hateful erthes, and surmounteth the roundnesse
of the greet ayr; and it seeth the cloudes behinde his bak'; bk. iv. met.
1. Hence, in l. 973, Ten Brink (Studien, p. 186) proposes to read--'That
wryteth, Thought may flee so hye.'

981, 2. Imitated from 2 Cor. xii. 2.

985. _Marcian._ Cf. C. T., E 1732 (March. Tale):--

 'Hold thou thy pees, thou poete Marcian,
  That wrytest us that ilke wedding murie
  Of hir, Philologye, and him, Mercurie.'

Martianus Minneus Felix Capella was a satirist of the fifth century, and
wrote the Nuptials of Mercury and Philology, De Nuptiis inter Mercurium et
Philologiam, above referred to. It consists of two books, followed by seven
books on the Seven Sciences; see Warton's Hist. E. Poetry, ed. 1871, iii.
77. 'Book viii (l. 857) gives a hint of the true system of astronomy. It is
quoted by Copernicus'; Gilman.

986. _Anteclaudian._ The Anticlaudianus is a Latin poem by Alanus de
Insulis, who also wrote the De Planctu Naturæ, alluded to in the Parl. of
Foules, 316 (see note). This poem is printed in Anglo-Latin Satirical
Poets, ed. Wright, pp. 268 428; see, in particular, Distinctio Quarta,
capp. 5-8, and Distinctio Quinta, cap. 1; pp. 338-347. It is from this poem
that Chaucer probably borrowed the curious word _citizein_ (l. 930) as
applied to the _eyrish bestes_ (l. 932). Thus, at pp. 338, 360 of Wright's
edition, we find--

 'Vestigans, videt intuitu meliore _vagantes
  Aerios cives_.'

 '_Hic cives habitant_ supremi regis in urbe;
  Civibus his servanda datur _respublica_ coeli.'

So again, ll. 966-969 above may well have been suggested by these lines (on
p. 340), and other similar lines:--

 'Aeris excurso spatio, quo nubila coeli
  Nocte sua texunt tenebras, quo pendula nubes
  In se cogit aquas, quo grandinis ingruit imber,
  Quo certant venti, quo fulminis ira tumescit,
  Æthera transgreditur Phronesis.'

1003. _Or him or here_, or him or her, hero or heroine; e.g. Hercules,
Perseus, Cepheus, Orion; Andromeda, Callisto (the Great Bear), Cassiopeia.
Cf. Man of Lawes Tale, B 460.

1004. _Raven_, the constellation _Corvus_; see Ovid, Fasti, ii. 243-266.
_Either bere_; Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

1005. _Ariones harpe_, Arion's harp, the constellation Lyra; Ovid's Fasti,
i. 316; ii. 76.

1006. _Castor_, _Pollux_; Castor and Pollux; the constellation Gemini.
_Delphyn_, Lat. Delphin; the constellation Delphin (Ovid, Fasti, i. 457) or
Delphinus, the Dolphin.

                         'Astris Delphina recepit
  Iupiter, et Stellas iussit habere nouem.'
                                    Ovid's Fasti, ii. 117.

1007. _Atlante_ does not mean Atalanta, but represents _Atlante_, the
ablative case of _Atlas_. Chaucer has mistaken the form, having taken the
story of the Pleiades (the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione) from
Ovid's Fasti, v. 83:--

 'Hinc sata _Pleïone_ cum coelifero _Atlante_
    iungitur, ut fama est; _Pleïadas_que parit.'

1021. _Up the heed_, up with your head; look about you.

1022. 'St. Julian (to our speed); lo! (here is) a good hostelry.' The eagle
invokes or praises St. Julian, because they have come to their journey's
end, and the poet may hope for a good reception in the House of Fame. St.
Julian was the patron saint of hospitality; see Chaucer's Prologue, 340. In
Le Roman de la Rose, 8872, I find (cf. note to l. 118 above):--

 'Ainsinc m'aïst saint Juliens,
  Qui pelerins errans herberge.'

In Bell's Chaucer, i. 92, is the following: '"Ce fut celluy Julien qui est
requis de ceux qui cheminent pour avoir _bon hostel_"; Legende Dorée.
Having by mischance slain his father and mother, as a penance he
established a hospital near a dangerous ford, where he lodged and fed
travellers gratuitously.'

See Tale xviii. in the Gesta Romanorum, in Swan's Translation; Caxton's
Golden Legende; and the Metrical Lives of Saints in MS. Bodley 1596, fol.
4, 'I pray God and St. Julian to send me a good lodging at night';
translation of Boccaccio, _Decam._ Second Day, nov. 2; quoted in Swan's tr.
of Gesta Romanorum, p. 372. See Warton, Hist. Eng. Poet., ed. Hazlitt, i.
247; ii. 58.

1024. 'Canst thou not hear that which I hear?'

1034. _Peter!_ By St. Peter; a common exclamation, which Warton amazingly
misunderstood, asserting that Chaucer is here addressed by the name of
Peter (Hist. E. P., ed. Hazlitt, ii. 331, note 6); whereas it is _Chaucer
himself_ who uses the exclamation. The Wyf of Bathe uses it also, C. T., D
446; so does the Sumpnour, C. T., D 1332; and the wife in the Shipman's
Tale, C. T., B 1404; and see l. 2000 below. See also my note to l. 665 of
the Canon's Yeoman's Tale. But Warton well compares the present passage
with Ovid, Met. xii. 49-52:--

 'Nec tamen est clamor, sed paruae murmura uocis;
  qualia de pelagi, si quis procul audiat, undis
  esse solent: qualemve sonum, quum Iupiter atras
  increpuit nubes, extrema tonitrua reddunt.'

1044. _Beten_, beat, occurs in MSS. F. and B. But the other reading _byten_
(bite) seems better. Cf. Troil. iii. 737, and the common saying 'It won't
bite you.'

1048. Cf. Dante, Purg. iii. 67-69. So also Inf. xxxi. 83.

1063. _Lyves body_, a person alive; _lyves_ is properly an adverb.

1066. _Seynte_; see note to l. 573. _Seynte Clare_, Saint Clara, usually
Saint Clare, whose day is Aug. 12. She was an abbess, a disciple of St.
Francis, and died A.D. 1253.


BOOK III.

1091-1109. Imitated from Dante, Parad. i. 13-27. Compare ll. 1106, 1107,
with Cary's translation--

 'If thou to me of thine impart so much, ...
  Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree
  Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves.'

And compare l. 1109 with--'Entra nel petto mio.'

1098. This shews that Chaucer occasionally, and intentionally, gives a
syllable too little to the verse. In fact, he does so just below, in l.
1106; where _Thou_ forms the first foot of the verse, instead of _So thou_,
or _And thou_. This failure of the first syllable is common throughout the
poem.

1099. _And that_, i.e. And though that; see l. 1098.

1109. _Entreth_ is the imperative plural; see note to A. B. C. 17.

1114. MSS. _cite_, _cyte_ (F. _citee_!); but _site_ in Astrol. pt. ii. 17.
25 (p. 201).

1116. 'Fama tenet, summaque domum sibi legit in arce'; Ovid, Met. xii. 43.
Cf. Dante, Purg. iii. 46-48; also Ovid, Met. ii. 1-5.

1131. 'And swoor hir ooth by Seint Thomas of Kent'; C. T., A 3291. It
alludes to the celebrated shrine of Beket at Canterbury.

1136. _Half_, side; _al the half_, all the side of the hill which he was
ascending, which we find was the _south_ side (l. 1152).

1152. This suggests that Chaucer, in his travels, had observed a snow-clad
mountain; the snow lies much lower on the north side than on the south
side; see ll. 1160 (which means that it, i.e. the writing, was preserved by
the shade of a castle), 1163, 1164.

1159. _What hit made_, what caused it, what was the cause of it.

1167-80. This passage somewhat resembles one in Dante, Par. i. 4-12.

1177. _Craft_, art; _cast_, plan. _Craft_, in the MSS., has slipt into l.
1178.

1183. _Gyle_, Giles; St. Ægidius. His day is Sept. 1; see note to Can. Yem.
Tale, G 1185, where the phrase _by seint Gyle_ recurs.

1189. _Babewinnes_ is certainly meant; it is the pl. of _babewin_ (O. Fr.
_babuin_, Low Lat. _babewynus_, F. _babouin_), now spelt _baboon_. It was
particularly used of a grotesque figure employed in architectural
decoration, as in Early Eng. Allit. Poems, ed. Morris, B. 1411, where the
pl. form is spelt _baboynes_, and in Lydgate, Chron. Troy, II. xi; both
passages are given in Murray's Dict., s.v. _Baboon_. 'Babewyn, or babewen,
_detippus_, _ipos_, _figmentum_, _chimera_'; Prompt. Parv. 'Babwyne, beest,
_baboyn_'; Palsgrave. In Shak. _Macb._ iv. 1. 37--'Coole it with a báboones
blood'--the accent on the _a_ is preserved. The other spellings are
inferior or false.

1192. _Falle_, pres. pl., fall; (or perhaps fallen, the past participle).

1194. _Habitacles_, niches; such as those which hold images of saints on
the buttresses and pinnacles of our cathedrals. They are described as being
_al withoute_, all on the outside.

1196. _Ful the castel_, the castle (being) full, on all sides. This line is
parenthetical.

1197. Understand _Somme_, some, as nom. to _stoden_. 'In which stood ...
(some) of every kind of minstrels.' So in l. 1239. As to minstrels, &c.,
see note to Sir Topas (B 2035).

1203. _Orpheus_, the celebrated minstrel, whose story is in Ovid, Met. x.
1-85; xi. 1-66. Chaucer again mentions him in C. T., E 1716; and in Troil.
iv. 791.

1205. _Orion_; so in all the copies; put for _Arion_. His story is in Ovid,
Fasti, ii. 79-118.

Spelt _Arione_ in Gower, Conf. Amant. (end of prologue), ed. Pauli, i. 39.
We might read _Arion_ here; see l. 1005.

1206. _Chiron_; called _Chiro_ in Gower, C. A. ii. 67 (bk. iv). Chiron, the
centaur, was the tutor of Achilles; and Achilles, being the grandson of
Æacus, was called Æacides; Ovid, Met. xii. 82; Fasti, v. 390. Hence
_Eacides_ is here in the genitive case; and _Eacides Chiron_ means
'Achilles' Chiron,' i.e. Chiron, tutor of Achilles. In fact, the phrase is
copied from Ovid's _Æacidæ Chiron_, Art of Love, i. 17. Another name for
Chiron is _Phillyrides_; Ovid, Art of Love, i. 11; or _Philyrides_; Verg.
Georg. iii. 550; cf. Ovid, Fasti, v. 391. In a similar way, Chaucer calls
the paladin _Oliver_, friend of _Charles_ the Great, by the name of
_Charles Olyuer_; Monkes Tale, B 3577.

1208. _Bret_, Briton, one of the British. This form is quite correct, being
the A.S. _Bret_, a Briton (see A.S. Chronicle, an. 491), commonly used in
the pl. _Brettas_. This correct spelling occurs in MS. B. only; MS. P.
turns it into _Bretur_, Th. and Cx. read _Briton_, whilst MS. F. turns
_Bret_ into _gret_, by altering the first letter. The forms _gret_ and
_Bretur_ are clearly corruptions, whilst _Briton_ spoils the scansion.

_Glascurion_; the same as Glasgerion, concerning whom see the Ballad in the
Percy Folio MS., ed. Hales and Furnivall, i. 246. Of this 'a traditional
version, under the name of _Glenkindie_, a various form of Glasgerion, is
given in Jamieson's Popular Songs and Ballads, and in Alex. Laing's Thistle
of Scotland (1823).' G. Douglas associates 'Glaskeriane' with Orpheus in
his Palice of Honour, bk. i. (ed. Small, i. 21); this poem is a palpable
imitation of Chaucer's House of Fame. The name is Celtic, as the epithet
_Bret_ implies. Cf. Irish and Welsh _glas_, pale.

1213. 'Or as art imitates nature.' Imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, where
Art asks Nature to teach her; l. 16233 is--

 'E la _contrefait comme singes_.'

1218. There is a similar list of musical instruments in Le Rom. de la Rose,
21285-21308:--

 'Puis _chalemiaus_, et chalemele
  Et tabor, et _fléute_, et timbre ...
  Puis prent sa muse, et se travaille
  As estives de Cornoaille.'

And in Le Remède de Fortune, by G. de Machault, 1849, p. 87, is a similar
long list:--

 '_Cornemuses_, flaios, chevrettes,
  Dousainnes, cimbales, clochettes,
  Timbre, la _flahute_ brehaigne,
  Et le grant cornet d'Alemaigne,
  Flaiot de saus, fistule, _pipe_'; &c.

And a few lines below there is mention of the _muse de blez_ (see note to
l. 1224). Warton, Hist. E. Poet., ed. Hazlitt, iii. 177. quotes a similar
passage from Lydgate's poem entitled Reason and Sensualite, ending with--

 'There were trumpes, and trumpettes,
  Lowde shallys [shalmys?] and _doucettes_.'

Cf. also Spenser, F. Q. vi. 9, 5; Shep. Kal. _Feb._ 35-40. In the latter
passage, the imitation of ll. 1224-6 is obvious. _Cornemuse_ is a bagpipe;
_shalmye_ is a shawm, which was a wind-instrument, being derived from Lat.
_calamus_, a reed; Chaucer classes both instruments under _pipe_. Willert
(on the House of Fame, p. 36) suggests (and, I think, correctly) that
_doucet_ and _rede_ are both adjectival. Thus _doucet_ would refer to
_pipe_; cf. '_Doucet_, dulcet, pretty and sweet, or, a little sweet';
Cotgrave. _Rede_ would also refer to _pipe_, and would mean 'made with a
reed.' A reed-instrument is one 'in which the sound was produced by the
vibration of a reed, as in the clarionet or hautboys'; note in Bell's
Chaucer. There is no instrument properly called a _doucet_ in Old French,
but only _dousainne_ (see above) and _doucine_ (Godefroy).

1222. _Brede_, roast meat; A.S. _br['æ]de_, glossed by '_assura_, vel
_assatura_' in Ælfric's Glossary, ed. Wülcker, col. 127, l. 17. Cf. G.
_Braten_. Not elsewhere in Chaucer, but found in other authors.

 'To meit was greithed beef and motoun,
  _Bredes_, briddes, and venysoun.'
                   Kyng Alisaunder, ed. Weber, 5248.

In the allit. Morte Arthure, it occurs no less than five times. Also in
Havelok, l. 98, where the interpretation 'bread' is wrong. Also in
Altenglische Dichtungen, ed. Böddeker, p. 146, l. 47--'Cud as Cradoc in
court that carf the _brede_,' i.e. carved the roast meat; but the glossary
does not explain it. The scribe of MS. F. turns _brede_ into _bride_,
regardless of the rime. I cannot agree with the wholly groundless
conjecture of Willert, who reads _rude_ in l. 1221, in order to force
_brude_ into the text. For minstrelsy at feasts, see C. T., A 2197.

1223. Cf. G. Douglas, tr. of Vergil, Æn. vii. 513, 4:--'And in ane bowand
_horne_, at hir awyne will, A feindlych hellis voce scho _lyltis_ schyll.'

1224. Alluding to the simple pipes fashioned by rustics. The glossary to
Machault's Works (1849) has: '_Muse de blez_, chalumeau fait avec des brins
de paille.' The O.F. _estive_, in the quotation in the note to l. 1218, has
a like sense. Godefroy has: '_estive_, espèce de flûte, de flageolet ou
pipeau rustique, qui venait, ce semble, de Cornouaille.' Cf. the term
_corne-pipe_, in the Complaint of Scotland, ed. Murray, p. 65, l. 22; also
my note to R. Rose, 4250 (vol. i. p. 436).

1227-8. Nothing is known as to Atiteris (or Cytherus); nor as to Pseustis
(or Proserus). The forms are doubtless corrupt; famous musicians or poets
seem to have been intended. I shall venture, however, to record my guess,
that _Atiteris_ represents _Tyrtaeus_, and that _Pseustis_ is meant for
_Thespis_. Both are mentioned by Horace (Ars Poet. 276, 402); and Thespis
was a native of Attica, whose plays were acted at Athens. Another guess is
that _Atiteris_ means Vergil's _Tityrus_; Athenæum, Apr. 13, 1889. Willert
suggests that there is here an allusion to the so-called Ecloga Theoduli, a
Latin poem of the seventh or eighth century, wherein the shepherd Pseustis
and the shepherdess Alithia [who represent Falsehood and Truth] contend
about heathendom and Christianity; and Pseustis adduces various myths and
tales, from Ovid, Vergil, and Statius. He refers us to H. Dunger, Die Sage
v. troj. Kriege in den Bearbeitungen des Mittelalters: Dresden, 1869, p.
76; cf. Leyser, Hist. Poet. Medii Aevi, p. 295. This only accounts for
Pseustis; Atiteris can hardly be Alithia.

1229. This is a curious example of how names are corrupted. _Marcia_ is
Dante's _Marsia_, mentioned in the very passage which Chaucer partly
imitates in ll. 1091-1109 above. Dante addresses Apollo in the words--

 'Entra nel petto mio, e spira tue
  Si come quando Marsia traesti
  Della vagina delle membra sue.'

As Chaucer had here nothing to guide him to the gender of _Marsia_, he
guessed the name to be feminine, from its termination; and Dante actually
has _Marzia_ (Inf. iv. 128), with reference to _Marcia_, wife of Cato. But
Dante's _Marsia_ represents the accus. case of Marsyas, or else the Lat.
nom. _Marsya_, which also occurs. Ovid, Met. vi. 400, has '_Marsya_ nomen
habet,' and tells the story. Apollo defeated the satyr Marsyas in a trial
of musical skill, and afterwards flayed him alive; so that he 'lost his
skin.'

1231. _Envyën_ (accent on _y_), vie with, challenge (at a sport). So strong
is the accent on the _y_, that the word has been reduced in E. to the
clipped form '_vie_; see _Vie_ in my Etym. Dict. It represents Lat.
_inuitare_, to challenge; and has nothing to do with E. _envy_. Florio's
Ital. Dict. has: '_Inuito_, a vie at play, a vie at any game; also an
inuiting.'

1234. 'Pipers of every Dutch (German) tongue.'

1236. _Reyes_, round dances, dances in a ring. The term is Dutch. Hexham's
Du. Dict. (1658), has: _een Rey_, or _een Reye_, a Daunce, or a round
Daunce'; and '_reyen_, to Daunce, or to lead a Daunce.' Cf. G. _Reihen_, a
dance, _Reihentanz_, a circular dance; M.H.G. _reie_, _reige_; which does
not seem to be connected, as might be thought, with G. _Reihe_, a row; see
Kluge and Weigand. Perhaps the Du. word was borrowed from O.F. _rei_,
_roi_, order, whence also the syllable _-ray_ in E. _ar-ray_; and the G.
word may have been borrowed from the Dutch; but this is a guess. 'I can
daunce the raye'; Barclay's First Egloge, sig. A ii. ed. 1570; quoted in
Dyce's Skelton, ii. 194.

1239. Understand _Somme_, some; see note to l. 1197. The expression _blody
soun_ recurs in Kn. Tale, A 2512, in connection with _trumpe_ and
_clarioun_. Our author explains his meaning here; ll. 1241-2.

1243. _Missenus_, Misenus, son of Æolus, trumpeter to Hector, and
subsequently to Æneas; Verg. Æn. iii. 239; vi. 162-170.

1245. _Joab_ and _Theodomas_ are again mentioned together in a like passage
in the Merch. Tale (C. T., E 1719). 'Joab blew a trumpet'; 2 Sam. ii. 28;
xviii. 16; xx. 22. Theodomas is said by Chaucer (Merch. Tale) to have blown
a trumpet 'At Thebes, when the citee was in doute.' He was therefore a
trumpeter mentioned in some legendary history of Thebes. With this hint, it
is easy to identify him with Thiodamas, mentioned in books viii. and x. of
the Thebaid of Statius. He succeeded Amphiaraus as augur, and furiously
excited the besiegers to attack Thebes. His invocation was succeeded by a
great sound of trumpets (Theb. viii. 343), to which Chaucer here refers.
But Statius does not expressly say that Thiodamas blew a trumpet himself.

1248. _Cataloigne and Aragon_, Catalonia and Arragon, in Spain, immediately
to the S. of the Pyrenees. Warton remarks: 'The martial musicians of
English tournaments, so celebrated in story, were a more natural and
obvious allusion for an English poet'; Hist. E. P. ii. 331. The remark is,
I think, entirely out of place. Chaucer is purposely taking a wide range;
and, after mentioning even the pipers of the Dutch tongue, as well as Joab
of Judæa and Thiodamas of Thebes, is quite consistent in mentioning the
musicians of Spain.

1257. Repeated, at greater length, in C. T., Group B, ll. 19-28; see note
to that passage.

1259. _Iogelours_, jugglers. See Squi. Tale, F 219.

1260. _Tregetours_; see C. T., F 1141, on which Tyrwhitt has a long note. A
_jogelour_ was one who amused people, either by playing, singing, dancing,
or tricks requiring sleight of hand; a _tregetour_ was one who brought
about elaborate illusions, by the help of machinery or mechanical
contrivance. Thus Chaucer tells us (in the Frank. Tale, as above) that
_tregetoures_ even caused to appear, in a dining-hall, a barge floating in
water, or what seemed like a lion, or a vine with grapes upon it, or a
castle built of lime and stone; which vanished at their pleasure. Sir John
Maundeville, in his Travels, ch. 22, declares that the 'enchanters' of the
Grand Khan could turn day into night, or cause visions of damsels dancing
or carrying cups of gold, or of knights justing; 'and many other thinges
thei don, be craft of hire Enchauntementes; that it is marveyle for to
see.' See note to l. 1277 below. Gawain Douglas imitates this passage in
his Palice of Honour; see his Works, ed. Small, i. 65.

1261. _Phitonesses_, pythonesses. The witch of Endor is called a
_phitonesse_ in the Freres Tale, C. T., D 1510; and in Gower, Conf. Amant.
bk. iv, ed. Pauli, ii. 66; in Barbour's Bruce, ed. Skeat, iv. 753; and in
Skelton's Phyllyp Sparowe, 1345. The Vulgate version has _mulier pythonem
habens_, 1 Sam. xxviii. 7 (cf. Acts xvi. 16); but also the very word
_pythonissam_ in 1 Chron. x. 13, where the witch of Endor is again referred
to. Ducange notices _phitonissa_ as another spelling of _pythonissa_.

1266. Cf. Chaucer's Prologue, 417-420. There is a parallel passage in
Dante, Inf. xx. 116-123, where the word _imago_ occurs in the sense of
'waxen image.' This of course refers to the practice of sticking needles
into a waxen image, with the supposed effect of injuring the person
represented. See Ovid, Heroid. vi. 91, and Ben Jonson's Masque of Queens
(_3rd Charm_). But this is only a particular case of a much more general
principle. Images of men or animals (or even of the things representing the
zodiacal signs) could be made of various substances, according to the
effect intended; and by proper treatment were supposed to cause good or
evil to the patient, as required. Much could be done, it was supposed, by
choosing the right time for making them, or for subjecting them to
celestial influences. To know the right time, it was necessary to observe
the _ascendent_ (see note to l. 1268). See much jargon on this subject in
Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia, lib. ii. capp. 35-47.

1268. The _ascendent_ is that point of the zodiacal circle which is seen to
be just ascending above the horizon at a given moment. Chaucer defines it
in his Treatise on the Astrolabe, and adds that astrologers, in calculating
horoscopes, were in the habit of giving it a wider meaning; they further
reckoned in 5 degrees of the zodiac above the horizon, and 25 degrees below
the ascending point, so as to make the whole _ascendent_ occupy 30 degrees,
which was the length of a 'sign.' In calculating nativities, great
importance was attached to this ascendent, the astrological concomitants of
which determined the horoscope. The phrase to be 'in the ascendant' is
still in use. Thus _in certeyn ascendentes_ is equivalent to 'in certain
positions of the heavens, at a given time,' such as the time of one's
birth, or the time for making an _image_ (see last note). See p. 191
(above).

1271. _Medea_, the famous wife of Jason, who restored her father Æson to
youth by her magical art; Ovid, Met. vii. 162. Gower tells the whole story,
C. A. bk. v. ed. Pauli, ii. 259.

1272. _Circes_, Circe, the enchantress; Homer's Odyssey, bk. x; Ovid, Met.
xiv. Ovid frequently has the form _Circes_, in the gen. case; Met. xiv. 10,
69, 71, 247, 294. Cf. Chaucer's Boethius, b. iv. met. 3. 24.

_Calipsa_, Calypso, the nymph who detained Ulysses in an island; Odyssey,
bk. i; Ovid, ex Ponto, iv. 10. 13.

1273. _Hermes_ is mentioned in the Can. Yeom. Tale, C. T., Group G, 1434,
where the reference is to Hermes Trismegistus, fabled to have been the
founder of alchemy, though none of the works ascribed to him are really
his. The name _Balenus_ occurs, in company with the names of _Medea_ and
_Circe_, in the following passage of the Rom. de la Rose, l. 14599:--

 'Que ja riens d'enchantement croie,
  Ne sorcerie, ne charroie,
  Ne _Balenus_, ne sa science,
  Ne magique, ne nigromance, ...
  Onques ne pot tenir _Medée_
  Jason por nul enchantement;
  N'onc _Circe_ ne tint ensement
  Ulixes qu'il ne s'enfoïst,' &c.

(_Charroie_ is the dance of witches on their sabbath.) _Hermes Ballenus_ is
really a compound name, the true significance of which was pointed out to
me by Prof. Cowell, and explained in my letter to The Academy, Apr. 27,
1889, p. 287. _Ballenus_ is 'the sage Belinous,' who discovered, beneath a
statue of _Hermes_, a book containing all the secrets of the universe.
Hence _Hermes' Ballenus_ (where _Hermes_ is an epithet) means 'Belinous,
who adopted the philosophy of Hermes.' For an explanation of the whole
matter, see the fourth volume of the Notices et Mémoires des Manuscrits de
la Bibliothèque du Roi, p. 107. In this there is an article by De Sacy,
describing MS. Arabe de la Bibl. du Roi, no. 959, the title of which is 'Le
Livre du Secret de la Creature, par le sage Belinous.' Belinous possessed
the art of talismans, which he professed to have learnt from Hermes. There
is some reason for identifying him with Apollonius of Tyana.

1274. _Lymote_, according to Warton, is Limotheus; but he omits to tell us
where he found such a name; and the suggestion seems no better than his
mistake of supposing _Calipsa_ (l. 1272) to mean the muse Calliope!
Considering that he is mentioned in company with Simon Magus, or Simon the
magician (Acts viii. 9), the suggestion of Prof. Hales seems probable, viz.
that _Lymote_ or _Lymete_ (as in F.) means Elymas the sorcerer (Acts xiii.
8).

1275. 'I saw, and knew by name, those that,' &c.

1277. _Colle tregetour_, Colle the juggler; see l. 1260. _Colle_ is here a
proper name, and distinct from the prefix _col-_ in _col-fox_, Non. Pr.
Tale, B 4405. _Colle_ is the name of a dog; Non. Pr. Tale, B 4573. _Colyn_
and _Colle_ are names of grooms; Polit. Songs, p. 237. Tyrwhitt quotes a
passage from The Testament of Love, bk. ii:--'Buserus [Busiris] slew his
gestes, and he was slayne of Hercules his gest. Hugest betraished many
menne, and of _Collo_ was he betraied'; ed. 1561, fol. 301, col. 2. With
regard to _tregetour_, see the account of the performances of Eastern
jugglers in Yule's edition of Marco Polo; vol. i. p. 342, and note 9 to Bk.
i. c. 61. Col. Yule cites the O.F. forms _tregiteor_ and _entregetour_;
also Ital. _tragettatore_, a juggler, and Prov. _trasjitar_, _trajitar_, to
juggle. Bartsch, in his Chrestomathie Française, has examples of
_trasgeter_, to mould, form, _tresgeteïs_, a work of mechanical art; and,
in his Chrestomathie Provençale, col. 82, has the lines--

 'Non saps balar ni _tras-gitar_
  a guiza de juglar guascon';

i.e. thou know'st not how to dance, nor how to juggle, after the manner of
a Gascon juggler. A comparison of the forms leaves no doubt as to the
etymology. The Prov. _trasgitar_ answers to a Low Lat. form _trans-iectare_
= _tra-iectare_, frequentative of Lat. _trans-icere_, _tra-icere_, to throw
across, transfer, cause to pass. Thus, the orig. sense of _tregetour_ was
one who causes rapid changes, by help of some mechanical contrivance. The
F. _trajecter_, to ferry, transport, in Cotgrave, is the same word as the
Prov. _trasgitar_, in a different (but allied) sense.

1292. 'As is the usual way with reports.'

1295. Accent _Which_ and _so_.

1297. 'And yet it was wrought by haphazard quite as often as by heed.'

1300. _To longe_, too long; not 'to dwell long.' The barbarous practice of
inserting an adverb between _to_ and an infinitive, as in 'to
ungrammatically talk,' is of later date, though less modern than we might
perhaps imagine. Cf. l. 1354.

1302. Elide the former _Ne_; read _N'of_.

1303. Read--Ne hów they hátt' in másonéries; i.e. nor how they are named in
masonry, as, for example, corbets full of imageries. _They hatte_, i.e.
they are called, was turned into _hakking_, and the sense lost.

1304. _Corbets_, corbels. Florio's Ital. Dict. has, '_Corbella_,
_Corbetta_, a little basket'; shewing the equivalence of such forms. The E.
_corbel_ is the same word as O.F. _corbel_ (F. _corbeau_), apparently from
the Lat. _coruus_. The spelling with _z_ (= _ts_) in MSS. F. and B. shews
that the form is really _corbetts_ or _corbets_, not _corbelles_. Spenser
has the simple form _corb_; F. Q. iv. 10. 6:--

 'It was a bridge ybuilt in goodly wise
  With curious _corbes_ and pendants graven faire.'

'A _Corbel_, _Corbet_, or _Corbill_ in masonrie, is a iutting out like a
_bragget_ [bracket] as carpenters call it, or shouldering-peece in
timber-work'; Minsheu's Dict. ed. 1627. Tyrwhitt explains _corbets_ by
'niches for statues'; but 'imageries' are not necessarily statues or
_images_, but rather specimens of carved work.

1309. 'A bounty! a bounty! hold up (your hands) well (to catch it).' Sir W.
Scott explains _largesse_ as 'the cry with which heralds and pursuivants
were wont to acknowledge the bounty received from the knights'; note to
Marmion, canto i. St. 11. The word is still in use amongst gleaners in East
Anglia; see my note to P. Plowman, C. viii. 109.

1311. In Anglia, xiv. 236, Dr. Köppell points out some resemblances between
the present poem and Boccaccio's Amorosa Visione. He compares this line
with the A. V. vi. 75:--'Io son la Gloria del popol mondano.'

1316, 7. _Kinges_, i.e. kings-at-arms; _losenges_, lozenges (with _g_ as
_j_).

1326. _Cote-armure_, surcoat; see Way's note in Prompt. Parv.

1329-35. Imitated from Rom. Rose, 6762-4.

1330. _Been aboute_, used like the old phrase _go about_.

1342-6. Cf. Boccaccio, Amorosa Visione, iv. 9:--'Ed in una gran sala ci
trovammo; Chiara era e bella e risplendente d'oro.'

1346. _Wikke_, poor, much alloyed.

1352. _Lapidaire_, 'a treatise on precious stones, so entitled; probably a
French translation of the Latin poem of Marbodus _De Gemmis_, which is
frequently cited by the name of _Lapidarius_; Fabricius, Bibl. Med. Æt., in
v. _Marbodus_'; Tyrwhitt's Glossary. The Lapidarium of Abbot Marbodus
(Marboeuf), composed about 1070-80, is chiefly taken from Pliny and
Solinus. A translation in English verse is given in King's Antique Gems.
See note to l. 1363 below. There is some account of several precious stones
in Philip de Thaun's Bestiary, printed in Wright's Popular Treatises on
Science; at p. 127 he refers to the _Lapidaire_. Vincent of Beauvais refers
to it repeatedly, in book viii. of his Speculum Naturale. There is a note
about this in Warton, Hist. E. P. ed. 1871, ii. 324. And see note to l.
1363.

1360. _Dees_, daïs; see the note to Prol. 370, in vol. v. Lines 1360-7 may
be compared with various passages in Boccaccio's Amorosa Visione, which
describe a lady in a rich vesture, seated on a royal throne:--

 'Tutti li _soprastava_ veramente
  Di _ricche pietre_ coronata e d'oro' ...
 'Il suo vestire a guisa _imperiale_
  Era, e teneva nella man sinestra
  Un pomo d'oro; e'n _trono_ alla reale
  Vidi sedeva' ...
 'Odi: che mai _natura_ con sua arte
  _Forma_ non diede a si bella figura' ...
 'Donna pareva li leggiadra e pura'....

See Am. Vis. vi. 49, 58, 43, 48. See note to l. 1311 above.

1361. The reading _Sit_ would mean 'sitteth' or 'sits'; the reading _Sat_
would mean 'sat.' Both are wrong; the construction is _sitte I saugh_ = _I
saugh sitte_, I saw sit; so that _sitte_ is the infin. mood.

1363. _Carbuncle._ Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. Nat bk. viii. c. 51, has:
'_Carbunculus_, qui et Græcè _anthrax_ dicitur, vulgariter _rubith_.' An
account of the _Carbunculus_ is given in King's Natural History of Precious
Stones and Gems. He remarks that the ruby 'must also be included among the
numerous species of the _carbunculus_ described by Pliny, although he gives
the first rank to the _Carbunculi amethystizontes_, our Almandines or
Garnets of Siam.' See also his Antique Gems, where he translates sect. 23
of the Lapidarium of Marbodus thus:--

 'The _Carbuncle_ eclipses by its blaze
  All shining gems, and casts its fiery rays
  Like to the burning coal; whence comes its name,
  Among the Greeks as _Anthrax_ known to fame.
  Not e'en by darkness quenched, its vigour tires;
  Still at the gazer's eye it darts its fires;
  A numerous race; within the Lybian ground
  Twelve kinds by mining Troglydytes are found.'

1368-76. Cf. Boethius, in Chaucer's translation; bk. i. pr. 1, ll. 8-13
(vol. ii. p. 2).

1376. _Sterres sevene_, the seven planets.

1380. _Tolde_, counted; observe this sense.

1383. _Bestes foure_, four beasts; Rev. iv. 6. Cf. Dante, Purg. xxix. 92.

1386. Thynne remarks that _oundy_, i.e. wavy, is a term in heraldry; cf. E.
_ab-ound_, _red-ound_, _surr-ound_ (for _sur-ound_); all from Lat. _unda_.
Cf. Chaucer's use of _ounded_ in Troilus, iv. 736, and Le Roman de la Rose,
21399, 21400:--

 'Et voit ses biaus crins blondoians
  Comme undes ensemble ondoians.'

1390. 'And tongues, as (there are) hairs on animals.' 'Her feet are
furnished with partridge-wings to denote swiftness, as the partridge is
remarkable for running with great swiftness with outstretched wings. This
description is taken almost literally from the description of Fame in the
Æneid [iv. 176-183], except the allusion to the Apocalypse and the
partridge-wings'; note in Bell's Chaucer. But it is to be feared that
Chaucer simply blundered, and mistook Vergil's _pernicibus_ as having the
sense of _perdicibus_; cf. '_pedibus_ celerem et _pernicibus alis_'; Aen.
iv. 180.

1400. _Caliopee_, Calliope the muse; her eight sisters are the other Muses.
With ll. 1395-1405 cf. Dante, Par. xxiii. 97-111.

1411. Read--Bóth-e th'ármes. _Armes_, i.e. coats of arms. _Name_, name
engraved on a plate or written on a scroll.

1413. _Alexander_; see Monkes Tale, in C. T., B 3821. _Hercules_; see the
same; the story of the shirt is given in B 3309-3324. In Le Roman de la
Rose, l. 9238, it is called 'la venimeuse chemise.' Cf. Dante, Inf. xii.
68.

1431. _Lede_, lead, the metal of Saturn; _yren_, iron, the metal of Mars.
See note to Can. Yeom. Tale, G 820, and ll. 827, 828 of the same; also ll.
1446, 1448 below.

1433. Read--Th'Ebráyk Jósephús. In a note on Gower's Conf. Amantis, Warton
remarks--'Josephus, on account of his subject, had long been placed almost
on a level with the Bible. He is seated on the first pillar in Chaucer's
House of Fame. His Jewish History, translated into Latin by Rufinus in the
fourth century, had given rise to many old poems and romances; and his
Maccabaics, or History of the seven Maccabees, martyred with their father
Eleazar under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, a separate work
translated also by Rufinus, produced the Judas Maccabee of Belleperche in
the year 1240, and at length enrolled the Maccabees among the most
illustrious heroes of romance.'--ed. Hazlitt, iii. 26.

1436. _Iewerye_, kingdom of the Jews; cf. Prior. Tale, B 1679.

1437. Who the other seven are, we can but guess; the reference seems to be
to Jewish historians. Perhaps we may include Moses, Joshua, Samuel, Isaiah,
Daniel, Nehemiah; and, in any case, Ezra. The number _seven_ was probably
taken at random. With l. 1447 cf. Troil. ii. 630.

1450. _Wheel_, orbit. The orbit of Saturn is the largest of the (old) seven
planets; see Kn. Tale, 1596 (A 2454). The reason why Josephus is placed
upon Saturn's metal, is because history records so many unhappy casualties,
such as Saturn's influence was supposed to cause. All this is fully
explained in the Kn. Tale, 1597-1611 (A 2455-69).

1457. _Yren_, the metal of Mars; see note to l. 1431.

1459. This allusion to 'tiger's blood' is curious; but is fully accounted
for by the account of the two tigers in bk. vii. of the Thebaid. A peace
had nearly been made up between the Thebans and the other Greeks, when two
tigers, sacred to Bacchus, broke loose, and killed three men. They were
soon wounded by Aconteus, whereupon 'They fly, and flying, draw upon the
plain A bloody line'; according to Lewis's translation. They fall and die,
but are avenged; and so the whole war was renewed. Lydgate reduces the two
tigers to one; see his chapter 'Of a tame Tigre dwelling in Thebes'; in
part 3 of his Sege of Thebes.

1460. _Stace_ (as in Troil. bk. v, near the end, and Kn. Tale, A 2294) is
Publius Papinius Statius, who died A.D. 96, author of the Thebais and
Achilleis (see l. 1463), the latter being left incomplete. _Tholosan_ means
Toulousan, or inhabitant of Toulouse; and he is here so called because by
some (including Dante, whom Chaucer follows) he was incorrectly supposed to
have been a native of Toulouse. He was born at Naples, A.D. 61. Dante calls
him _Tolosano_ in Purg. xxi. 89, on which Cary remarks:--'Dante, as many
others have done, confounds Statius the poet, who was a Neapolitan, with a
rhetorican of the same name, who was of Tolosa or Thoulouse. Thus Chaucer;
and Boccaccio, as cited by Lombardi: "E Stazio di Tolosa ancora caro";
Amorosa Vis. _cant._ 5.'

Dr. Köppell quotes the last passage, from Boccaccio, Am. Vis. v. 34, in
Anglia, xiv. 237, and shews that other passages in the same resemble other
lines in the Hous of Fame. See notes to ll. 1311, 1342, 1360, 1483, 1487,
and 1499.

1463. 'Cantai di Tebe, e poi del grande Achille'; Dante, Purg. xxi. 92.

1466. _Omeer_, Homer; see ll. 1477-1480 below.

1467. In Chaucer's Troil. i. 146, is the line--'In Omer, or in Dares, or in
Dyte.' _Dares_ means Dares Phrygius; and _Tytus_ is doubtless intended for
the same person as _Dyte_, i.e. Dictys Cretensis. See the account in
Warton, Hist. E. Poet., ed. Hazlitt, ii. 127, beginning:--'But the Trojan
story was still kept alive in two Latin pieces, which passed under the
names of Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis,' &c.; and further in vol.
iii. p. 81. The chief source of the romantic histories of Troy in the
middle ages is the Roman de Troie by Benoit de Sainte-Maure, which appeared
between 1175 and 1185, and has lately been edited by M. Joly. This was
copied by Guido delle Colonne (see note to l. 1469 below), who pretended,
nevertheless, to follow Dares and Dictys. Chaucer cites Dares and Dictys at
second-hand, from Guido.

1468. _Lollius_; evidently supposed by Chaucer to be a writer on the Trojan
war. See Tyrwhitt's note on the words _the boke of Troilus_, as occurring
at the end of the Persones Tale. Chaucer twice quotes _Lollius_ in Troilus,
viz. in bk. i. 394 and bk. v. 1653. At the beginning of sect. xiv of his
Hist. of Eng. Poetry, Warton shews that there was a Lollius Urbicus among
the _Historici Latini profani_ of the third century; 'but this could not be
Chaucer's Lollius; ... none of his works remain.' The difficulty has never
been wholly cleared up; we know, however, that the Troilus is chiefly taken
from Boccaccio's Filostrato, just as his Knight's Tale is chiefly taken
from Boccaccio's Teseide. My idea of the matter is that, in the usual mode
of appealing to old authorities, Chaucer refers us (not to Boccaccio, whom
he does not mention, but) to the authorities whom he supposed Boccaccio
must have followed. Accordingly, in his Troilus, he mentions Homer, Dares,
Dictys, and Lollius, though he probably knew next to nothing of _any one_
of these authors. On this account, the suggestion made by Dr. Latham
(Athenæum, Oct. 3, 1868, p. 433) seems quite reasonable, viz. that he got
the idea that Lollius wrote on the Trojan war by misunderstanding the lines
of Horace, Epist. i. 2:--

 'Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,
  Dum tu declamas Romæ, Præneste relegi.'

See Ten Brink, Studien, p. 87. This supposition becomes almost a certainty
when we observe how often medieval writers obtained their information from
MSS. containing short extracts. Chaucer clearly never read Horace at all;
he merely stumbled on a very few extracts from him in notebooks. In this
way, he may easily have met with the _first line_ above, apart from its
context. Cf. vol. ii. pp. lii, liii.

1469. Guido delle Colonne, or Guido de Columnis (_not_ da Colonna),
finished his translation or version of Benoit de Sainte-Maure's Roman de
Troie in the year 1287. His work is called Historia Troiana. The 'Geste
Hystoriale' of the Destruction of Troy, edited by Panton and Donaldson for
the Early English Text Society, is a translation of Guido's Historia into
Middle English alliterative verse. See Warton, Hist. E. P., ed. Hazlitt,
iii. 81; and Introd. to vol. ii. pp. liv-lxv.

1470. _Gaufride_, Geoffrey, viz. Geoffrey of Monmouth, who died A.D. 1154,
and wrote a History of the Britons in Latin, full of extravagant but lively
fictions, which was completed in 1147; see Morley's Hist. E. Writers, i.
496. He is rightly mentioned among the writers who 'bore up Troy,' because
he makes the Britons the descendants of Æneas. See note below.

1477. _Oon seyde_, one (of them) said. Guido was one of those who said
this; this appears from the Gest Hystoriale above mentioned, which was
translated from Guido; see ll. 41-47, and 10312-10329 of Panton and
Donaldson's edition. Guido asserts, for example, that Achilles slew Hector
by treachery, and not, as Homer says, in fair fight; and Chaucer asserts
the same, Troil. v. 1560. The fact is, that the Latin races declined to
accept an account which did not sufficiently praise the Trojans, whom they
regarded as their ancestors. Geoffrey of Monmouth ingeniously followed up
this notion, by making the Trojans also the ancestors of the ancient
Britons. Hence English writers followed on the same side; Lydgate, as well
as Chaucer, exclaims against Homer. See Warton, ed. Hazlitt, iii. 82. But
Dante exalts Homer above Horace, Ovid, and Lucan: Inf. iv. 88.

1482. 'Homer's iron is admirably represented as having been by Virgil
covered over with tin'; note in Bell's Chaucer.

1483. There is a similar mention of Vergil in Boccaccio, Amorosa Visione,
v. 7. See note to l. 1460.

1487. _Ovide_, Ovid; from whom perhaps Chaucer borrows more than from any
other Latin writer. He stands on a pillar of copper, the metal sacred to
Venus. See note to l. 820 of Can. Yeom. Tale. And cf. Boccaccio, Amorosa
Visione, v. 25: 'Eravi Ovidio, lo quale poetando Iscrisse tanti versi per
amore.'

1494. _High the_ (as in F.) is an error for _highthe_, height; Cx. Th. have
_heyght_. Read _highte_, as in l. 744.

1499. _Lucan_; alluding to Lucan's Pharsalia, which narrates the war
between Cæsar and Pompey. See Man of Lawes Tale, B 401; Monkes Tale, De
Caesare, B 3909 (and note), and a fourth mention of him in Troilus, v.
1792. There is an English translation by Rowe. Cf. Boccaccio, Amorosa
Visione, v. 19: 'A' quai Lucan seguitava, ne' cui Atti parea ch'ancora la
battaglia Di Cesare narrasse, e di colui Magno Pompeo chiamato.'

1509. Claudius Claudianus, in the fourth century, wrote a poem De Raptu
Proserpinæ, alluded to here and in the Merchant's Tale (C. T., E 2232), and
several other pieces. See note to Parl. Foules, 99.

1512. Imitated from Dante, Inf. ix. 44: 'Della regina dell' eterno pianto.'

1519. _Write_, wrote; pt. t. pl. _Highte_, were named.

1521. Perhaps from Dante, Inf. xvi. 1, which Cary translates:--

 'Now came I where the water's din was heard,...
  Resounding like the hum of swarming bees,
  When forth together issued from a troop,' &c.

1527. Cf. Ovid, Met. xii. 53: 'Atria turba tenent; ueniunt leue uulgus,
euntque.'

1530. _Alles-kinnes_ is in the gen. sing., and _Of_ governs _condiciouns_;
thus the line is equivalent to--'Of conditions of every kind'; whereas
modern English uses--'Of every kind of condition.' This peculiar idiom was
formerly common; and precisely similar to it is the phrase _noskinnes_, for
which see note to l. 1794. Observe that the phrase is oddly written _alle
skynnes_ in MS. F., by a misdivision of the words. So in Piers Plowman, A.
ii. 175, we have the phrase _for eny kunnes yiftus_, for gifts of any kind,
where one MS. has _any skynes_. In my note to P. Plowman, C. xi. 128, I
give numerous examples, with references, of phrases such as _none kynnes
riche_, _many kynnes maneres_, _summes kunnes wise_, _what kyns schape_,
&c.

1550. 'Those that did pray her for her favour.'

1564. 'Because it does not please me.'

1570. I here alter _Vpon peyne_ to _Vp peyne_, as the former will not scan,
and the latter is the usual idiom. See _up peyne_ in Kn. Tale, A 1707,
2543; Man of Lawes Tale, B 795, 884. Cf. _vp the toft_, upon the toft, P.
Plowman, B. i. 12; _vp erthe_, upon earth, id. B. ix. 99.

1571. Cf. Rom. Rose, 18206--'Car Eolus, li diex des vens.' From Vergil, Æn.
i. 52; cf. Ovid, Met. xiv. 223, where Æolus is said to reign over the
Tuscan sea. The connection of Æolus with Thrace is not obvious; cf. l.
1585. Ovid, however, has 'Threicio Borea'; Art. Am. ii. 431. And see
Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 382.

1596. _Took to_, delivered to. _Triton_, Triton; imitated from Ovid, Met.
i. 333, where Neptune calls Triton, and bids him sound his 'shell,' the
sound of which resounded everywhere.

1598. We rarely find _to_ used after _leet_; the usual formula is _leet
go_. But cf. _leet to glyde_ in Cant. Ta., F 1415. Or read _to-go_,
_to-glyde_.

1618. _Wite_ is badly spelt _wete_ or _wote_ in the MS. copies; but the
very phrase _wite ye what_ occurs in C. T., E 2431. However, Ch. certainly
uses the phrase _ye woot_ instead of _ye wite_, more than once.

1640. _Overthrowe_, be overthrown; as in the Tale of Gamelin, 512. Cf.
Melibeus, B 2755.

1643. A _pelet_ was a stone ball, such as used to be fired from the
earliest kind of cannon, of which this is a very early mention. See my
glossary to P. Plowman (Clar. Press).

1670. _Lat goon_, let go, lay aside.

1702. The word _turned_, which is dissyllabic, has evidently been
substituted here in the printed editions and in MS. P. for the older and
rare word _clew_, which does not occur elsewhere in Chaucer. The line
means--'With that (therupon) I rubbed my head all round'; which is a rustic
way of expressing perplexity. The verb _clawen_, to scratch, stroke, is not
uncommon, but the usual pt. t. is _clawed_. We find, however, at least one
other example of the strong form of the past tense in the Seven Sages, ed.
Weber, l. 925--He _clew_ the bor on the rigge,' he stroked the boar on the
back, and made him go to sleep; cf. 'thi maister the _clawes_,' i.e. your
master strokes you, to flatter you, in l. 937 of the same. Chaucer has, 'to
_clawen_ [rub] him on his hele' [heel], Troil. iv. 728; 'he _clawed_ him on
the bak,' he stroked him on the back, to encourage him, Cook's Prol., A
4326 (where _clew_ would suit the line better). See _claw_ in Jamieson's
Scot. Dict.

1708. 'They would not give a leek.' Cf. 'dere ynough a leek'; Can. Yeom.
Tale, Group G, 795.

1740. 'Although no brooch or ring was ever sent us.'

1742-4. 'Nor was it once intended in their heart to make us even friendly
cheer, but they might (i.e. were ready to) bring us to our bier'; i.e. so
far from caring to please us, they would be satisfied to see us dead.

The M.E. _temen_, to produce, to bring, is the same word as mod. E. _teem_,
to produce. _To temen on bere_ is parallel to the old phrase _to bringen on
bere_; cf. Gaw. Douglas, tr. of Æneid, bk. x. ch. 10, l. 138 (ed. Small,
iii. 326), where _brocht on beyr_ means 'brought to their grave.' See
_Bier_ in the New Eng. Dictionary.

1747. _For wood_, as (if) mad, 'like mad.' The same phrase recurs in Leg.
Good Women, _Phyllis_, l. 27; cf. _as it were wood_, Kn. Tale, A 2950; and
_for pure wood_, Rom. Rose, 276.

1759-62. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 9887-90:--

 'Si se sunt maint vanté de maintes;
  Par paroles fauces et faintes,
  Dont les cors avoir ne pooient,
  Lor non à grant tort diffamoient.'

1761. _The name_, the name of it, the credit of it.

1777. _Masty_ (miswritten _maisty_ in F., but _masty_ in the rest) means
fat, fattened up, and hence unwieldy, sluggish. Bell alters it to _maisly_,
and Moxon's edition to _nastie_; both being wrong. Palsgrave has: '_Masty_,
fatte, as swyne be, _gras_.' The Promp. Parv. has: 'Mast-hog or swyne, [or]
mastid swyne, _Maialis_'; and 'Mastyn beestys, _sagino, impinguo_.' Way
rightly explains _masty_ as 'glutted with acorns or berries'; cf. 'Acorne,
_mast_ for swyne, _gland_,' in Palsgrave. See The Former Age, l. 37.

1779. _Wher_, whether, 'is it the case that?'

1782. As the word _oughte_ is never followed by _to_ with a following
gerund, it is certain that _to-hangen_ is all one word, the prefix _to-_
being intensive. MSS. F. and B. omit _to_, but the rest have it, and the
syllable is wanted. I know of no other example of _to-hangen_, to hang
thoroughly, but this is of little moment. The prefix _to-_ was freely added
to all sorts of verbs expressing strong action; Stratmann gives _more than
a hundred_ examples. Cf. note to l. 1598.

1783. We must read _sweynte_, the form preserved in MS. B, where the final
_e_ is added to the pp. _sweynt_, as if it were an adjective used in the
definite form. The reading _swynt_ is false, being an error for _sweynte_.
The reading _slepy_ is a mere gloss upon this rare word, but fairly
expresses the meaning. Bell's Chaucer has _swynt_, which the editor
supposes to be put for _swinkt_ = _swinked_, pp. of _swinken_, to toil, as
in Milton's 'swinkd hedger'; Comus, 293. He is, however, entirely wrong,
for Milton's _swink'd_ is quite a late form; in Chaucer's time the verb
_swinken_ was strong, and the pp. was _swunken_! Chaucer has _queynt_ as
the pp. of _quenchen_, Kn. Tale, A 2321; and _dreynt_ as the pp. of
_drenchen_, Non. Prest. Tale, B 4272. Similarly _sweynt_ is the pp. of
_swenchen_, to cause to toil, to fatigue, tire out, the causal verb formed
from the aforesaid strong intransitive verb _swinken_, to toil. For
examples, see _swenchen_ in Stratmann; I may instance, 'Euwer feond eou ne
scal ... _swenchen_,' your enemies shall not harass you, Old Eng. Homilies,
ed. Morris, i. 13; and 'hi _swencten_ swiðe heom-seolfe,' they sore
afflicted themselves, id. 101. Hence, 'the sweynte cat' means the
over-toiled or tired-out cat; or, secondarily, a cat that will take no
trouble, a slothful or _sleepy_ cat, as the gloss says. Compare Gower,
Conf. Amant. ed. Pauli, ii. 39, where the same cat is brought forward as an
example of the deadly sin of _Sloth_:--

 'For he [a knight] ne wol no travail take
  To ride for his ladies sake,
  But liveth al upon his wisshes,
  And--as a cat wolde ete fisshes
  Withoute weting of his clees--
  So wolde he do, but netheles
  He faileth ofte of that he wolde.'

The 'adage' is referred to in Macbeth, i. 7. 45. It occurs in MS. Harl.
2321, fol. 146, printed in Reliq. Antiquæ, i. 207, in the form: 'The cat
doth love the fishe, she will not wett her foote.' In Heywood's Proverbs,
1562 (p. 28, ed. Spenser Soc.): 'The cat would eate fyshe, and would not
wet her feete.' So also in Camden's Remains, 1614, p. 312. Hazlitt gives a
rimed version:--

 'Fain would the cat fish eat,
  But she's loth to wet her feet.'

In Piers the Plowman's Crede, 405, is the allusion:--

 'Thou woldest not weten thy fote, and woldest fich cacchen.'

In a medieval Latin verse, it appears as: 'Catus amat piscem, sed non vult
tingere plantam'; see Proverbialia Dicteria ... per A. Gartnerum, 1574,
8vo. Ray quotes the French: 'Le chat aime le poisson, mais il n'aime pas à
mouiller la patte.' The German form is--'Die Katze hätt' der Fische gern;
aber sie will die Füsse nit nass machen'; N. and Q. 4 S. ix. 266.

1794. _Noskinnes_; miswritten _no skynnes_ in MSS. F. and B.; Th. and Cx.
_no kyns_. _Nos-kinnes_ is short for _noneskinnes_, of no kind; _noskinnes
labour_ is 'work of no kind'; in mod. E. 'no kind of work.' It also occurs
without the former _s_; as in _no kyne catel_, property of no kind, P.
Plowm. C. xi. 250; _none kynnes riche_, rich men of no kind, id. B. xi.
185. Cf. also _of foure kunne thinges_, of things of four kinds, of four
kinds of things, where one MS. has _of foure skynnes thinges_; P. Plowm. A.
x. 2. And see note to l. 1530 above.

1796. _Bele Isaude_, Isaude (or Isoude, or Isolde) the fair; here a type of
a high form of female beauty. See Parl. Foules, 290; and the note.

1798. 'She that grinds at a hand-mill'; a poor slave.

1810. _Hir_ (their) refers to the 'seventh company.' 'Such amusement they
found in their hoods'; a phrase meaning 'so much did they laugh at them';
see Troil. ii. 1110. Cf. the phrase 'to put an ape in a man's hood,' i.e.
to make him look like an ape, or look foolish; see note to C. T., Group B,
1630.

1823. 'Then a company came running in.'

1824. _Choppen_, strike downwards. They began hitting people on the head,
regardless of consequences. The same expression occurs in Richard the
Redeless, iii. 230--'And ich man i-charchid to schoppe at his croune';
where _i-charchid_ = _i-charged_, i.e. was charged, was commanded, and
_schoppe_ = _choppe_.

1840. _Pale_, a perpendicular stripe; chiefly used as an heraldic term. The
object of the conspicuous stripe upon the hose was to draw men's attention
to him; for the same reason, he wore a bell on his tippet, and, in fact,
his dress resembled that of the professional fool. _Paled_ or striped hose
were sometimes worn for display.

 'Buskins he wore of costliest cordwayne,
  Pinckt upon gold, and _paled_ part per part,
  As then the guize was for each gentle swayne.'
                                 Spenser, _F. Q._ vi. 2. 6.

I.e. his buskins were adorned with golden dots or eyelets, and regularly
intersected with stripes arranged perpendicularly.

1844. _Isidis_, Isis; _Isidis_ being a form of the genitive case. Chaucer
doubtless refers to Herostratus, the wretch who set fire to the temple of
Diana at Ephesus, in order to immortalise his name. Why Diana here appears
as Isis, and Ephesus as Athens, I cannot explain. Perhaps it was due to a
defect of memory; we are apt to forget how _very_ largely medieval authors
had to trust to their memories for names and facts. It is almost impossible
for us moderns, with our facilities for reference, to imagine what were the
difficulties of learned men in the olden time. Perhaps Chaucer was thinking
of Ovid's line (ex Ponto, i. 1. 51)--'Uidi ego linigerae numen uiolasse
fatentem _Isidis_.' The story is in Solinus, Polyhistor, cap. xl. § 3.

 'See, Erostratus the second
  Fires again Diana's fane.'
        Rejected Addresses; _Drury's Dirge_, st. 5.

1853. Thynne prints--'(Though it be naught) for shreudness'; but this is
very forced. MS. B. and Caxton both omit _noght_, rightly.

1857. 'And, in order to get (some) of the meed of fame.'

1880. An allusion to the old proverb--'As I brew, so must I needs drink';
in Camden's Remains. Gower has it, Conf. Amant. bk. iii, ed. Pauli, ii.
334:--

 'And who so wicked ale breweth,
  Ful ofte he mot the werse drinke.'

1908. The form _bringes_, for _bringest_, though (strictly speaking) a
Northern form, is not uncommon in East Midland. It occurs frequently, for
example, in Havelok the Dane. But, as there is no other clear example in
Chaucer, Koch thinks the passage is corrupt, and proposes to read:--

 'Which than be, lo! thise tydinges,
  That bringe thee hider, and thise thinges
  That thou wilt here'; &c.

1920. Here _that_ means 'that very.' The description of 'the house of
Dædalus' is in Ovid, Met. viii. 159; and the word _labyrinthus_, used with
reference to it, is in Vergil, Æn. v. 588. Chaucer again refers to it in
the Leg. of Good Women (Ariadne), 2010; and it is mentioned in his
translation of Boethius, bk. iii. pr. 12. 118 (vol. ii. p. 89). And see
Gower, Conf. Amant. ed. Pauli, ii. 304.

1926. This somewhat resembles Dante, Inf. iii. 53, which Cary translates:--

 'Which whirling ran about so rapidly
  That it no pause obtain'd.'

1928. _Oise_, a river which flows into the Seine, from the north, not far
below Paris. Chaucer says the sound might have been heard from there to
Rome. From this vague statement, Warton would wish us to infer that the
whole poem was founded on some foreign production now (and probably always)
unknown. There is no need to draw any such conclusion. The English were
fairly familiar with the north of France in days when a good deal of French
soil belonged more or less to the king of England. The Oise, being a
northern affluent of the Seine, must have been a well-known river. I think
the allusion proves just nothing at all.

1933. This is an excellent and picturesque allusion, but in these days can
no longer be appreciated. Compare Barbour's Bruce, xvii. 681:--

 'The engynour than deliuerly
  Gert bend the gyne in full gret hy,
  And the stane smertly swappit out.
  It flaw out, quhedirand, with a _rout_.'

1940. Though the authorities read _hattes_ (Th. _hutches_), I alter this
word to _hottes_ without hesitation. We do not make _hats_ with twigs or
osiers. Chaucer says that some of the twigs were white, such as men use to
make cages with, or panniers (i.e. baskets), or _hottes_, or _dossers_. Now
Cotgrave explains F. _Panier_ by 'a Pannier, or Dosser; also, a Pedlers
Pack; also, a fashion of trunke made of wicker'; and he explains F. _Hotte_
by 'a Scuttle, Dosser, Basket to carry on the back; the right _hotte_ is
wide at the top, and narrow at the bottom.' Dr. Murray kindly refers me to
Cursor Mundi, l. 5524:--

 'Apon þer neckes sal þai bere
  _Hott_ wit stan and wit morter.'

He also tells me that in Caxton's Golden Legend (1483), fol. cix. col. 2,
is the sentence--'And bare on hys sholdres vij. _hottis_ or baskettis fulle
of erthe.' In a Glossary of North of England Words, printed as Gloss. B. 1,
by the Eng. Dial. Society, I find: '_Hots_, s. pl. a sort of panniers to
carry turf or slate in'; and Halliwell gives it as a Cumberland word.
Dickenson's Cumberland Glossary has: '_Muck-hots_, panniers for conveying
manure on horseback.' Brockett's Gloss. of Northern Words has: '_Hot_, a
sort of square basket, formerly used for taking manure into fields of steep
ascent; the bottom opened by two wooden pins to let out the contents.' Thus
the existence of the word in English is fully proved; and the fitness of it
is evident.

1943. 'Al ful of chirking was that sory place'; Kn. Tale, A 2004.

1946. Again from Ovid, Met. xii. 44-47.

1970. Read--'Of estáts and éek of regióuns.' The _e_ in _estat_ was very
light; hence mod. E. _state_.

1975. _Mis_ is here an adjective, meaning 'bad' or 'wrong'; cf. 'But to
correcten that is _mis_ I mente'; Can. Yeom. Tale, G 999.

1980. 'Although the timber,' &c.

1982. 'As long as it pleases Chance, who is the mother of news, just as the
sea (is mother) of wells and springs.'

1997. _Paráventure_; also spelt _paraunter_, shewing how rapidly the third
syllable could be slurred over.

2000. _Peter!_ by St Peter; see note to l. 1034.

2004. _Cunne ginne_, know how to begin. (_Gin_, a contrivance, is
monosyllabic).

2009. I substitute the dissyllabic _swich-e_ for the monosyllabic _these_,
to preserve the melody.

2011. 'To drive away thy heaviness with.'

2017. MS. F. has _frot_, which has no meaning, but may be a misspelling of
_froit_, which is another form of _fruit_. As Koch says, we must read _The
fruit_, remembering that Chaucer uses _fruit_ in the peculiar sense of
'upshot' or 'result.'

 'And for it is no _fruit_ but los of tyme'; Squi. Ta., F 74.

 'The _fruyt_ of this matere is that I telle'; Man of Lawes Ta., B 411.

In the present case, it would be used in a _double_ sense; (1) of result,
(2) of a fruit that withers and is ready to burst open. As to the spelling
_froit_, we find _froyte_ in the Petworth MS. in the latter of the above
quotations, where other MSS. have _fruyt_ or _fruite_. _The swote_ (Cx.
Th.) means 'the sweetness.'

2019. _That_, in this line, goes back to _Sith that_ in l. 2007.

2021. I suppress _in_ after _yaf_, because it is not wanted for the sense,
and spoils the metre.

2034-40. Suggested by Dante, Inf. iii. 55-57, just as ll. 1924-6 above are
by the two preceding lines in Dante; see note to l. 1926. Cary has:--

                           'and following came
  Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er
  Have thought that death so many had despoil'd.'

In l. 2038, _left_ means 'left alive.'

2044. I substitute _ech_ for _euerych_ (in Caxton). The two MSS. (F. and
B.) have merely _Rouned in others ere_, which is of course defective.

2048. I here follow B. (except that it wrongly omits _lo_).

2059. _Wondermost_; superl. of _wonder_, which is very common as an
_adjective_.

2076. As the reading of the MSS. is obviously wrong (the word _mouth_ being
repeated three times), whilst the reading of the printed editions (_Wente
every tydyng_) cannot be right on account of the scansion, I put _word_ for
the first of the three _mouths_. This gives the right sense, and probably
Chaucer actually wrote it.

2089. Again from Ovid, Met. xii. 54, 55. _A sad soth-sawe_, a sober truth.

2099. _With the nones_, on the condition; see Leg. of Good Women, 1540; and
the note. So also in the Tale of Gamelyn, 206.

2101. See Kn. Tale, 273, 274 (A 1131).

2105. _Beside_, without; without asking his leave.

2119. Cf. Cant. Tales, D 1695--'Twenty thousand freres on a route,' where
Tyrwhitt prints _A twenty_. But the MSS. (at least the seven best ones) all
omit the _A_. Just as the present line wants its first syllable, and is to
be scanned--'Twénty thoúsand ín a roúte'; so the line in the Cant. Tales
wants its first syllable, and is to be scanned--Twénty thoúsand fréres ón a
roúte. For having called attention to this fact, my name (misspelt)
obtained a mention in Lowell's My Study Windows, in his (otherwise
excellent) article on Chaucer. 'His (Chaucer's) ear would never have
tolerated the verses of nine[63] syllables with a strong accent on the
first, attributed to him by Mr. Skeate and Mr. Morris. Such verses seem to
me simply impossible in the pentameter iambic as Chaucer wrote it.' Surely
this is assumption, not proof. I have only to say that the examples are
rather numerous, and nine-syllable lines are not impossible to a poet with
a good ear; for there are twelve consecutive lines of this character in
Tennyson's Vision of Sin. It may suffice to quote one of them:--

 'Pánted hánd in hánd with fáces pále.'

I will merely add here, that similar lines _abound_ in Lydgate's 'Sege of
Thebes,' and that there are 25 clear examples of such lines in the Legend
of Good Women, as I shew in my Introduction to that Poem.

2123. Cf. P. Plowman; B. prol. 46-52. _Bretful_, brim-ful, occurs in P. Pl.
C. i. 42; also in Chaucer, Prol. 687; Kn. Tale, 1306 (A 2164).

2130. _Lyes_; F. _lies_, E. _lees_. '_Lie_, f. the lees, dregs, grounds';
Cotgrave.

2140. Sooner or later, every sheaf in the barn has to come out to be
thrashed.

2152. 'And cast up their noses on high.' I adopt this reading out of
deference to Dr. Koch, who insists upon its correctness. Otherwise, I
should prefer the graphic reading in MS. B.--'And up the nose and yën
caste.' Each man is trying to peer beyond the rest.

2154. 'And stamp, as a man would stamp on a live eel, to try to secure it.'
Already in Plautus, Pseudolus, 2. 4. 56, we have the proverb _anguilla est,
elabitur_, he is an eel, he slips away from you; said of a sly or slippery
fellow. In the Rom. de la Rose, 9941, we are told that it is as hard to be
sure of a woman's constancy as it is to hold a live eel by the tail. 'To
have an eel by the tail' was an old English proverb; see _Eel_ in Nares'
Glossary, ed. Halliwell and Wright.

2158. The poem ends here, in the middle of a sentence. It seems as if
Chaucer did not quite know how to conclude, and put off finishing the poem
till that more 'convenient season' which never comes. Practically, nothing
is lost.

The copy printed by Caxton broke off still earlier, viz. at l. 2094. In
order to make a sort of ending to it, Caxton added twelve lines of his own,
with his name--Caxton--at the side of the first of them; and subjoined a
note in prose, as follows:--

  And wyth the noyse of them [t]wo[64]
  I Sodeynly awoke anon tho[65]
  And remembryd what I had seen
  And how hye and ferre I had been
  In my ghoost / and had grete wonder
  Of that [that?] the god of thonder
  Had lete me knowen / and began to wryte[66]
  Lyke as ye haue herd me endyte
  Wherfor to studye and rede alway[67]
  I purpose to doo day by day
  Thus in dremyng and in game
  Endeth thys lytyl book of Fame.

I fynde nomore of this werke to-fore sayd. For as fer as I can vnderstonde
/ This noble man Gefferey Chaucer fynysshed at the sayd conclusion of the
metyng of lesyng and sothsawe / where as yet they ben chekked and may nat
departe / whyche werke as me semeth is craftyly made'; &c. (The rest is in
praise of Chaucer). But, although Caxton's copy ended at l. 2094, lines
2095-2158 appear in the two MSS., and are obviously genuine. Thynne also
printed them, and must have found them in the MS. which he followed. After
l. 2158, Thynne subjoins Caxton's ending, with an alteration in the first
three lines, as unsuitable to follow l. 2158. Hence Thynne prints them as
follows:--

  And therwithal I abrayde
  Out of my slepe halfe a frayde
  Remembri[n]g wel what I had sene.

We thus see that it was never pretended that the lines following l. 2158
were Chaucer's. They are admittedly Caxton's and Thynne's. Even if we had
not been told this, we could easily have detected it by the sudden
inferiority in the style. Caxton's second line will not scan at all
comfortably; neither will the third, nor the fourth. (The seventh can be
improved by altering _began_ to _gan_). And Thynne's lines are but little
better.




NOTES TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE.

  *** N.B. The references are to the B-text, except where special mention
  of the A-text is made. The latter is denoted by the letter 'A', preceded
  by a short line.

2. Compare Chaucer's Troilus, book ii. ll. 894-6.

5. _Nis noon_ = _ne is noon_, is not none, i.e. is no one. This use of the
double negative, as in modern provincial English, is extremely common, and
need not be again remarked upon. Cf. ll. 7, 15, &c.

9. 'For there may no man prove it by actual trial.'

10. _Leve_, believe. Notice the numerous senses of _leve_, viz. (1)
believe; (2) leave, _v._; (3) grant; (4) dear; (5) leave, _sb._; (6) leaf
(dat. case).

11. _Wel more thing_, many more things. The word _thing_ was originally
neuter, and long remained unchanged in the plural. In l. 23, we have
_thinges_. The M.E. _more_ usually means 'greater'; it is seldom used (as
here) in the modern sense.

12. _Men shal nat_, people ought not to. The use of _men_ in the general
sense of 'people' is extremely common in Chaucer, and the student should
notice that it usually takes a _singular_ verb, when thus used. With ll.
12, 13 cf. Hamlet, i. 5. 166.

13. _But-if_, unless, except. Great attention should be paid to the exact
sense of these apparently less important words. Frequently the whole sense
of a sentence is missed, even by editors, owing to inattention to their
use.

14. 'For, God knoweth, a thing is none the less true, although no one can
see it.'

16. In the margins of MSS. C. and F. is written the Latin proverb here
referred to, viz. 'Bernardus monachus non uidit omnia'; i.e. Bernard the
monk (even) did not see everything. The reference is to the great learning
and experience of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (born A.D. 1091, died Aug. 20,
1153). This we know from an entry in J. J. Hofmann's Lexicon Universale
(Basileæ, 1677), s.v. _Bernardus_, where we find: 'Nullos habuit
præceptores præter quercus et fagos. Hinc proverb: _Neque enim Bernardus
vidit omnia_.' See an account of St. Bernard in Alban Butler's Lives of the
Saints, or in Chambers' Book of Days, under the date of Aug. 20.

18. _Minde_, remembrance; see l. 26. Cf. 'to bear in _mind_.'

25. Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose, ed. Méon, 9669-72:--

 'Car par l'escript que nous avons,
  Les fais des anciens savons;
  Si les en devons mercier,
  Et loer et regracier.'

26. _Rémembráunce_; accented on the first and last syllables. The melody of
innumerable lines in Chaucer is only apparent to those who perceive the
difference between the present and the old accentuation, especially in the
case of French words. Besides, such accent is frequently variable; Chaucer
has _hónour_, _rénoun_, &c. at one time, and _honóur_, _renóun_, &c. at
another. Thus in l. 27 we have _honóuren_; and in l. 31 _credénce_.

27. _Wel oghte us_, it is very necessary for us, it well behoves us. _Us_
is here the dative case, and _oghte_ is the impersonal verb; in accordance
with Chaucer's usual method. But, in this case, there is a grammatical
difficulty; for the past tense _oghte_ is here used with the sense of the
present; the right form would be expressed, in modern English, by _oweth_,
and in M.E. by _ah_ (also _awe_, _o[gh]e_). Such use of the right form of
the present tense is exceedingly rare; and (possibly owing to a sense of
uncertainty about its true form) the form of the past tense was used both
for past and present, whether personal or impersonal, precisely as we now
use _must_ in place both of M.E. _mot_ (present) and _moste_ (past).
Mätzner only gives three examples of the present tense of this verb, when
used impersonally; viz. '_Hym awe_ to rise,' it behoves him to rise,
Metrical Homilies, p. 77; '_Vus o[gh]e_,' it behoves us, Allit. Poems, ed.
Morris, i. 552; '_Him owith_ to mynystre,' Reliquiæ Antiquæ, ii. 48.

The only right way of thoroughly understanding Chaucer's grammar is by
comparing one passage with another, observing how particular expressions
occur. This is best done by the proper process of reading the text; but
even the usual glossarial indexes will often furnish ready examples. Thus
the glossary to the Prioresses Tale gives the following examples:--

 'And ther she was honoured as _hir oughte_'; E 1120.

                     --'wel more _us oughte_
  Receyven al in gree that god us sent'; E 1150.

The glossary to the Man of Law's Tale gives:--

 'Alla goth to his in, and, as _him oughte_,' &c.; B 1097.

 'But that they weren as hem _oughte be_'; G 1340.

 'Wel _oughten we_ to doon al our entente'; G 6.

 'Wel _oughte us_ werche, and ydelnes withstonde'; G 14.

As to the spelling of the word, it may be remarked that _oghte_ is the more
correct form, because _[=o]_ answers to A.S. _[=a]_, and _gh_ to A.S. _h_
in the A.S. form _[=a]hte_. But a confusion between the symbols _ogh_,
_ugh_, and _ough_ soon arose, and all three were merged in the form _ough_;
hence neither _ogh_ nor _ugh_ occurs in modern English. See Skeat, Eng.
Etymology, § 333, p. 361.

The full explanation of this and similar phrases would extend these notes
to an inordinate length. Only brief hints can here be given.

28. _Ther_, where. The sense 'where' is commoner than the sense 'there.'

29. _Can but lyte_, know but little. Cf. Prior. Tale, B 1726, 1898.

30. _For to rede_, to read. The use of _for to_ with the gerundial
infinitive is found in Layamon and the Ormulum, and may have been suggested
by the like use of the French _pour_, O. Fr. _por_ (and even _por a_). See
Mätzner, Engl. Grammatik, ii. 2. 54. Compare Parl. Foules, 16, 695; Ho.
Fame, 657.

36. This connection of 'the month of May' with song and poetry is common in
Mid. Eng. poetry, from the natural association of spring with a time of joy
and hope. We even find something of the kind in A.S. poetry. See The
Phoenix, l. 250; Menologium, l. 75.

The earliest song in Middle English relates to the cuckoo; and, before
Chaucer, we already find, in the Romance of Alexander, l. 2049, such lines
as--

 'In tyme of May hot is in boure;
  Divers, in medewe, spryngith floure;
  The ladies, knyghtis honourith;
  Treowe love in heorte durith'; &c.

See also the poem on Alisoun, in Morris and Skeat, Spec. of Eng., part ii.
p. 43. Again, we have a like mention of the May-season and of the singing
of birds in the introduction to the Roman de la Rose; see vol. i. p. 96.

Nevertheless, the whole of the present passage is highly characteristic of
the author, and extremely interesting. Cf. ll. 108, 176.

40. _Condicioun_, temperament, character, disposition. Prof. Corson here
refers us to Shakespeare, Merch. Ven. i. 2. 143; Cor. v. 4. 10; Oth. iv. 1.
204; Jul. Cæs. ii. 1. 254, &c.

41. On the scansion, see note to l. 67.

43. _Daysyes_, daisies; here dissyllabic. But in l. 182 we have the full
form _day-es-y-e_, of four syllables, answering to the A.S. _dæges éage_
(or _ége_), lit. day's eye, or eye of day, as Chaucer himself says in l.
184. And it is worth adding that his etymology is perfectly correct; for,
in the few instances in which etymologies are suggested in Middle English,
they are usually ludicrously wrong. In l. 184, the word is only trisyllabic
(_day-es-y'_), the last syllable suffering elision. The A.S. _dægesége_
occurs in a list of plants in A.S. Leechdoms, ed. Cockayne, iii. 292, l. 8;
and we also find in Wright's A.S. Vocabularies, ed. Wülker, col. 135, l.
22, and col. 322, l. 11, the following entries:--'_Consolda_, dægesege,'
and '_Consolda_, dægeseage.'

The primary meaning of _dæges éage_ is doubtless the sun; the daisy is
named from its supposed likeness to the sun, the white petals being the
rays, and the yellow centre the sun's sphere.

Compare Lydgate's Troy-book, ed. 1555, fol. K 6, back:--

 'And next, Appollo, so clere, shene, and bright,
  The _dayes eye_, and voyder of the nyght.'

46. 'That, when in my bed, no day dawns upon me on which I am not (at once)
up, and (am soon) walking in the meadow.' _Nam_ = _ne am_, am not.

49. _By the morwe_, with the (dawn of the) morning.

50. _Sight-e_ is dissyllabic, as the scansion shews. In l. 15, _wight_ is
monosyllabic. It is often difficult to ascertain Chaucer's usage of such
forms, and we have to observe, where we can, any instances that are
helpful. The Rime-Indexes to the Canterbury Tales and to the Minor Poems
are often of great service. We learn from them that _wight_ rimes with the
monosyllables _bright_, _knight_, _might_, _night_, _right_, &c., whereas
_sighte_ rimes with the infin. moods _light-e_, _fight-e_, &c., as well as
with monosyllables, and is therefore used somewhat capriciously. Another
helpful list is that given in Ellis's Early Eng. Pronunciation, ch. iv. §
5, founded upon Prof. Child's articles on Chaucer and Gower. This at once
refers us to C. T. 2118 (It were a lusty _sight-e_ for to see); 2335 (But
sodeinly she saugh a _sight-e_ queynte); &c.

We should also consider the etymology. Now _wight_ = A.S. _wiht_, is
monosyllabic, and gives no difficulty. On the other hand, the A.S. for
'sight' is _gesiht_ or _gesihþ_; but it is a fem. sb., and makes _all_ its
oblique cases with a final _-e_, viz. _gesiht-e_ or _gesihþ-e_. In such
instances, the nominative case often lost its distinctive form, and took
the form of the other cases, so that already in the Ormulum (l. 12670) we
find the nom. case _sihhþ-e_, dissyllabic. Such usages have received
careful attention in the present edition, and in almost every case the
addition of a final _e_ in an unexpected place can be amply justified by
instances of Chaucer's usage in other passages. If the student will
endeavour to _verify_ some of the examples here given, he will soon come to
a clearer knowledge of the matter.

52. _Hit_, it, i.e. the daisy. But in l. 53 it is referred to as _she_. We
shall see why this is hereafter. As a mere flower, it is neuter; but as
being the type of Alcestis, it is feminine. Cf. ll. 62, 63.

53. We have come to the first instance in which Chaucer transposed the
order of his material in the course of revision. Line 53 of the B-text
corresponds to A. 55, whilst B. 61 corresponds to A. 51. All such instances
are clearly shewn by printing the transposed passages twice over, once in
their right place, and again in their changed place _in a smaller type_. By
this arrangement all such transpositions can be understood at a glance.

The blank space which here appears in the A-text corresponds to ll. 50-52
in B, which are marked with an asterisk as being peculiar to the latter
text. In order to save space, a small blank space (of one or two lines
only) often corresponds to an insertion in the other text of some length.

56. 'And I love it, and ever (do so) equally anew,' i.e. unalterably.

57. The word _herte_ is so common that it is worth while to remember that
it is usually dissyllabic; the A.S. form being _heorte_.

58. _Al_, although (very common). _Of this_, in this matter.

61. _Weste_, is here a verb; 'to turn to the west.' See l. 197.

65. Probably to be scanned thus: Óf | the sónn' | for thér | hit wól |
unclós-e. See note to l. 67, and cf. l. 111.

66. _Ne had_, pronounced as _nad_; and often so written.

67. The first syllable of a line is often wanting in Chaucer; so that the
first foot consists of a single emphatic syllable. Such lines are now
considered faulty, though examples may be found in Tennyson's 'Vision of
Sin,' which cannot be called unmelodious; but they were once common,
especially in Lydgate. Some examples from the present poem are the
following:--

  That | of alle the floures in the mede; 41.

  Suf | fisant this flour to preyse aright; 67.

  Of | this flour, whan that hit shulde unclose; 111.

  Made | hir lyk a daysie for to sene; 224.

So also ll. 245, 303, 722, 783, 797, 859, 863, 901, 911, 1024, 1030, 1076,
1187, 1275, 1324, 1342, 1498, 1551, 1828, 1996, 2471, 2575.

68. _Conning_, knowledge. Many words now used with a changed signification
are well explained in Trench's Select Glossary, which should be consulted
for them. Thus, in the article upon _cunning_, Trench quotes the following
from the examination of Wm. Thorpe, as preserved in Foxe's Book of
Martyrs:--'I believe that all these three Persons [in the Godhead] are even
in power and in _cunning and in might_'.

69. _Make_, compose poetry; _of sentement_, concerning your feelings. So in
l. 74, _making_ is 'poetry.' See Trench, s.v. _make_; where it is shewn
that the use of the word arose quite independently of the Gk. use of
[Greek: poiein] and [Greek: poiêtês]. 'One of the earliest instances of the
use of _makyere_ in the sense of "author" occurs in the Kentish Ayenbite of
Inwyt, ed. Morris, p. 269; written A.D. 1340. The A.S. _scóp_ and O.H.G.
_scóf_ mean "a shaper." The G. _Dichter_ means an "arranger"; the Fr.
_trouvère_, Provençal _troubadour_, and Ital. _trovatore_ means a
"finder."'--Skeat, note to P. Plowman, B. xii. 16 (where _makynges_ means
'poems').

72. Cf. l. 193. There appears to be here some reference to a poem of the
kind called in F. _tenson_ (O.F. _tençon_) or in O. Provençal _tenso_, i.e.
'dispute,' in which the relative merits of two subjects are discussed. An
early example in English is the poem called The Owl and the Nightingale, in
which these birds contend for the superiority. In the present case, the
suggestion is to discuss the value of the Leaf, representing no doubt
constancy or any enduring virtue, as compared with that of the Flower, the
representative of perishable beauty and the freshness of first love.
Chaucer probably refers to some such poem in French, but I cannot point out
the exact source.

On the other hand, the present passage doubtless suggested the poem called
'The Flower and the Leaf,' a pretty but somewhat tedious poem of the
fifteenth century, in which Chaucer's style is imitated with no remarkable
exactness or success. This poem was formerly rashly attributed to Chaucer
himself without any evidence, though it was printed for the first time as
late as 1598. See it discussed in vol. i. p. 44. Gower also refers to the
present passage; C. A. iii. 358.

In scanning this line, remember to pronounce _Whether_ as _Whe'r_, a
monosyllable. This is common also in Shakespeare, as in his 59th Sonnet:
'_Whe'r_ we are mended, or _whe'r_ better they.'

74. _Making_, poetry; _ropen_, reaped. 'For I well know, that ye (poets)
have long ere this reaped the field of poetry, and carried away the corn
from it; and I come after you as a gleaner.' See note to l. 69. Compare
Parl. Foules, 22-25.

The A.S. _rípan_, to reap, was a strong verb; pt. t. _ráp_, pp. _ripen_.
The M.E. forms are various and corrupt, and not very common. In P. Plowman,
B. xiii. 374, the pt. t. is _rope_, pl. _ropen_. The proper form of the pp.
is _r[)i]pen_; the form _ropen_ is due to that confusion between the past
tense and past participle which is so extremely common in English. See
Morris, Hist. Outlines of Eng. Accidence, p. 160.

80. _Evel apayd_, ill pleased, displeased; a common phrase. See Cler. Tale,
E 1052; Can. Yem. Tale, G 921, 1049. _Apayd_, pleased, occurs in the Kn.
Tale, 1010 (A 1868).

85. _Wynt_, windeth, turns (me) about, directs (me). These contracted forms
of the third person singular of the present indicative are almost universal
in Anglo-Saxon, and very common in M.E. Chaucer has _fynt_ = findeth, _rit_
= rideth, _hit_ = hideth, _et_ = eateth, l. 1389, &c. A much earlier
example of _wint_ for _windeth_ is in the Ancren Riwle, p. 296.

86. _In-with_, within. This curious form is not very common in Chaucer.
Still it occurs in l. 228 below; in the Prior. Tale, B 1794; Cler. Tale, E
870; March. Tale, E 1944; Troilus, ii. 508, iii. 1499, &c. See Mätzner.

88. _Nothing I_, I am not at all (the master of it).

90. This is a fine simile. His lady sovereign can evoke from him any tone
at will. _And maketh_ = and (the hand) makes. Bell puts _That_ for _And_,
without authority.

93. _Yow list_, it pleases you. _List_ = _listeth_; cf. note to l. 85.

97. 'But why said I that we should give credence?' See ll. 10, 20.

In the A-text (l. 81) _But wherfor_ is used differently, and means--'But
the reason why,' &c.

100. _Seen at eye_, see evidently. So in the Can. Yem. Tale, G 1059. Cf.
_fair at yë_, fair to the sight, id. G 964; Cler. Tale, E 1168. The promise
made in l. 101 was not fulfilled.

103. _Besy gost_, active spirit. _Thrusteth_, thirsteth.

105. _Gledy_, glowing; an adj. formed from _gleed_, a glowing coal. I know
of no other example of this word. The compound adj. _gled-read_, glede-red,
i.e. red as a glowing coal, occurs in O. Eng. Homilies, ed. Morris, i. 249.

108. The first of May was a favourite time for joyful observances. See note
to Kn. Tale, A 1500.

109. _Dredful_, timid, timorous; as in Kn. Tale, A 1479.

112. _Agayn_, against, towards, turned towards; as in l. 48.

113. _The beste_, i.e. the Bull, the sign Taurus. _Agenores doghter_ is
Europa, daughter of Agenor of Phoenicia, who, according to the fable, was
carried off by Jupiter in the form of a bull. Hence Ovid uses the
expression 'Agenoreus bos,' Fast. vi. 712; and calls Europa 'Agenore nata,'
Met. ii. 858. For the story, see the latter reference.

Chaucer here tells us that the Sun, on the 1st of May, was 'in the breast'
of Taurus, i.e. in the middle of it. It was, in fact, far advanced in the
sign, near the 20th degree. See Fig. 1 in this volume, which shews the back
of the Astrolabe.

118. Cf. Book of the Duchesse, 399.

125. Cf. Book of the Duchesse, ll. 410-2, which is a parallel passage. Both
passages are borrowed from the Roman de la Rose, 55-58; see vol. i. p. 95.

126. _Mat_, dead; a term borrowed from the game of chess. See Anelida, 176;
Book Duch., 660; and Kn. Tale, A 955.

128. _Atempre_, temperate, mild. See Book of the Duch., 341, and the note.
This again is from the Rom. de la Rose, 125. _Releved_, raised up again,
revived. Cotgrave gives: '_Relevé_, raised, lift, or set up again;
relieved, revived, fully restored.'

130. 'In the classical and middle ages small birds were a common article of
food, as they are on the continent at the present time; and the season for
catching them with a _panter_, or bag-net, was winter, when the scarcity of
food made them tame. The poet here represents their songs in the spring, as
the expression of their exultation at having baffled the stratagems,
quaintly called _sophistries_, by which the fowler had endeavoured to lure
them to their destruction.'--BELL.

The word _panter_ is curiously preserved in the mod. E. _painter_, a rope
for mooring a boat. I quote the following from my Etym. Dict.: '"_Painter_,
a rope employed to fasten a boat"; Hawkesworth's Voyages, 1773, vol. i. p.
xxix. Corrupted (by assimilation to the ordinary sb. _painter_) from M.E.
_panter_, a noose, esp. for catching birds. See Chaucer, Leg. of Good
Women, 131; Prompt. Parv., p. 381; spelt _paunter_, Polit. Songs, ed.
Wright, p. 344.--O.F. _pantiere_, a kind of snare for birds, Roquefort;
_panthiere_, "a great swoop-net"; Cotgrave. Cf. Ital. _pantiera_, "a kind
of tramell or fowling net"; Florio; _panthera_, "a net or haie to catch
conies with, also a kind of fowling-net"; id.--Lat. _panther_, a
hunting-net for catching wild beasts. Cf. _panthera_, an entire
capture.--Gk. [Greek: panthêros], catching all; cf. [Greek: panthêra], the
whole booty (a very late word).--Gk. [Greek: pan], neut. of [Greek: pas],
every; and [Greek: thêr], a wild beast.

'The Irish _painteir_, Gael. _painntear_, a gin, snare, are forms of the
same word [but were borrowed from English or French]. It is remarkable
that, in America, a _panther_ is also called a _painter_. See Cooper, The
Pioneers, cap. xxviii.'

132. _Upon_, against, in scorn of; cf. _in his despyt_, l. 134. _A-whaped_,
scared.

--A. 127. The A-text is hereabouts very imperfect, and some lines are too
short. I supply words within square brackets, in order to fill out the
lines, and to make sense.

145. See Parl. of Foules, 309, 683, and the note to the former passage in
vol. i. p. 516. Birds were supposed to choose their mates on St.
Valentine's day (Feb. 14).

146. _Chees_, chose: the past tense; A.S. _céas_.

154. _Tydif_, the name of some small bird, guessed by Skinner to be the
_titmouse_; more probably the _tydy_ mentioned by Drayton, which is
supposed to mean a wren. See _Tydy_ in Nares. Cf. Squi. Tale, F 648; id.
610, 611.

158. 'Provided that their mates would pity them.'

160. _Daunger_ usually means 'power to harm.' These allegorical personages
were suggested by the Roman de la Rose. In the English version (l. 3018)
_Daunger_ is the name of the 'foul churl,' who is set beside the Rose, to
prevent strangers from plucking it. In Chaucer's Complaint unto Pite, he
introduces such personages as Crueltee (corresponding to Daunger), Pite,
Bountee, Gentilesse, and Curtesye. So here, we are told that although
Daunger (i.e. power to harm or to repel) seemed for a time to have the
upper hand, yet at the last Pity induced relenting, and caused Mercy to
surpass (or prevail over) Right (or Justice). Just as Pity is opposed to
Danger or Cruelty, so we find, in the old theological allegories, that
Mercy is opposed to Justice. The pleading of Mercy against Justice will be
found at length in Grosteste's Chastel d'Amour, in the Cursor Mundi, p.
550, and in the Gesta Romanorum, Tale 55. See my note to P. Plowman, C.
xxi. 120.

163. 'By means of innocence and well-mannered courtesy.'

164. 'But I do not call folly, or false pity, by the name of innocence';
i.e. the poet does not approve of immodesty or weakness, because in all
things the chief virtue is moderation, or the 'golden mean.' Beauty should
be neither too yielding nor too pitiless.

166. _Etik_, Lat. _Ethica_; alluding to the Ethics of Aristotle, in which
happiness and virtue are discussed, and the nature of virtue is said to
shew itself in its appearing as the medium or mean between two extremes.
Similarly, Gower in his Conf. Amantis (ed. Pauli, iii. 153) refers us to
Aristotle's advice to Alexander, to keep the mean between avarice and
prodigality. See also Gower's remarks on _ethique_; id. iii. 140. Cf.
Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 387.

170. So in the Parl. of Foules, 680, the birds are described as joining in
the roundel--'Now _welcom somer_, with thy sonne softe.'

171. Here again is a reminiscence of the Roman de la Rose, ll. 8449-51:--

 'Zephirus et Flora, sa fame,
  Qui des flors est deesse et dame,
  Cil dui font les floretes nestre,' &c.

i.e. Zephirus and his wife Flora, who is the goddess and lady of flowers,
these two make the little flowers grow. See Book of the Duchesse, 402; and
the note upon it.

184. 'The daisy, or, otherwise, the eye of day'; see note to l. 43.

186. 'I pray that she may fall fairly,' that she may light upon good
fortune. All the MSS. have _she_; otherwise we might read _her_, as such is
the more usual idiom, in which case it would mean--'that it may befall her
fairly.' We have a similar case in the Manciple's Prologue, H 40, where six
MSS. have the usual idiom 'foule mot _thee_ falle,' whilst the Ellesmere
MS. alone has 'foule mot _thou_ falle.' For a similar variation, cf. l. 277
below with A. 180, i.e. with the corresponding line in the earlier text.

191. 'For, as regards me, neither of them is dearer or more hateful than
the other; I am not yet retained on the side of either of them.' The sense
_with-holden_ is detained, kept back, hence reserved to one side, committed
to a particular view.

195. _Thing_ = _werk_ (A. 79), i.e. poem. _Of another tonne_, out of quite
a different cask. Cf. 'Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tonne Er that I
go'; C. T., D 170. Cf. Rom. Rose (French Text), 6838.

196. _Swich thing_, such a thing as the strife between the Leaf and the
Flower. The A-text (l. 80) helps us here, as it reads 'swich stryf.'

203. _Herber_, an arbour. This difficult word is fully explained in the New
E. Dict., s.v. _arbour_. It is there shewn that the original sense of the
M.E. _herber_ or _erber_ was 'a plot of ground covered with grass or turf;
a garden-lawn or green.' In the Medulla Grammatices, ab. 1460, we
find:--'_Viretum, locus pascualis virens_, a gres-yerd, or an herber.'
Subsequently it meant a herb-garden or flower-garden; a fruit-garden or
orchard; trees or shrubs trained on frame-work; and then a bower, or 'shady
retreat, of which the sides and roof are formed by trees and shrubs closely
planted or intertwined, or of lattice-work covered with climbing shrubs and
plants, as ivy, vine, &c.' Dr. Murray remarks that 'the original
characteristic of the arbour seems to have been the floor and benches of
herbage [as here]; in the modern idea the leafy covering is the prominent
feature.'

The present passage was imitated and amplified by the authoress of The
Flower and the Leaf, beginning at l. 49:--

          'a pleasaunt herber well ywrought,
  That benched was, and with turfes new,
  Freshly turved, wherof the grene gras,
  So small, so thicke, so short, so fresh of hew,
  That most like unto green woll wot I it was;
  The hegge also, that yede in compas
  And closed in all the grene herbere,
  With sicamour was set and eglatere'; &c.

So too, in the Assembly of Ladies, st. 7:--

 'Which broght me to an herber fair and grene
  Made with benches ful crafty and clene.'

208. _Hed_, hidden. This rare form occurs again in Will. of Palerne, 688.
The usual M.E. forms are _hud_ and _hid_. Similarly Chaucer uses _ken_ for
'kin' in Book Duch. 438, the usual M.E. forms being _kun_ and _kin_; and we
find _ken_ also in Will. of Palerne, 722. These forms are Southern, and
mostly Kentish.

213. _The god of love_, Cupid; cf. Parl. Foules, 212. Cf. the description
in the E. version of the Rom. of the Rose, ll. 890, 1003.

_In his hande_, i.e. leading by the hand; see l. 241.

_A quene_, a queen, viz. Alcestis, as we afterwards learn. She is so
clothed as to represent a daisy; hence her green dress, golden
hair-ornament or caul, and white crown; see l. 218, and note to l. 227.

215. _Fret_ here means a caul of gold wire. They were sometimes set with
stones. Cf. Rom. Rose, 1108, and The Flower and the Leaf, 152:--'A riche
_fret_ of gold,' &c. See Fairholt, Costume in England.

217. The pause after _smale_ saves the final _e_ from elision. See examples
in the Cant. Tales, B 2153, 3281, 3989; &c. We may translate the phrase
_and I shal nat lye_ by 'if I am not to lie'; see l. 357, and the note.

221. _Oriental_, eastern; here, of superior quality. 'The precious stones
called by lapidaries _oriental ruby_, _oriental topaz_, _oriental
amethyst_, and _oriental emerald_ are red, yellow, violet, and green
sapphires, distinguished from the other gems of the same name which have
not the prefix _oriental_, by their greatly superior hardness, and greater
specific gravity'; Engl. Cyclopædia, s.v. Adamantine Spar. Cf. P. Plowman,
B. 2. 14.

223. _For which_, by means of which, whereby.

227. In the Rom. of the Rose the 'god of love' is said to be clothed 'not
in silk, but all in flowers'; his garment was all covered with flowers,
intermingled with rose-leaves; and he had a chaplet of red roses upon his
head. See the E. version, l. 890. In l. 228, _fret_ means merely 'ornament'
or 'border' of embroidery, whereas in l. 215 it is used in the sense of a
caul or net worn on the head. The A-text (160) has _garlond_, and adds that
lilies were stuck about among the rose-leaves. Moreover, a 'rose-leaf' here
means a petal, or it would not be described as red. _Greves_ is properly
'groves or bushes,' but must here mean sprays or small boughs.

231. _For hevinesse_, to save him from the heaviness and weight of gold.
The peculiar use of _for_ in the sense of 'against,' or 'to prevent,'
should be noticed. See the note to Sir Thopas, B 2052.

242. _Corouned_ is pronounced as _Coróun'd_.

--A. 179. Notice this mention of Alcestis in the A-text. This is altered in
the later version, so that the poet does not know who the queen is till l.
511, though she actually announces herself in l. 432. See note to l. 255
(B.) below.

249. _Absolon_, Absalom; remarkable for the beauty of his hair; see 2 Sam.
xiv. 26. Cf. 'Absalom o ses treces soves'; Rom. de la Rose, 14074. I have
little doubt that the general idea of this Ballade is taken from one quoted
from MS. du Roi, à Paris (fonds de Saint-Victor, no. 275, fol. 45, recto,
col. 2), by M. Michel, in his edition of Tristan, i. lxxxviii. It begins as
follows:--

 '_Hester_, Judith, _Penelope_, _Helaine_,
  Sarre, _Tisbe_, Rebeque, et Sairy,
  _Lucresse_, _Yseult_, Genèvre, chastelaine
  La très loial nommée de Vergy,
  Rachel, et la dame de Fayel
  _Onc ne furent si precieulx jouel_
  D'onneur, bonté, senz, beauté et valour
  _Con est ma très doulce dame d'onnour_.

  Se d'_Absalon_ la grant beauté humaine,' &c.

The refrain being, as before, 'Con est ma très doulce dame d'onnour.'

250. _Ester_, Esther; cited as an example of 'debonairte' in the Book of
the Duch. 986; see also C. T., E 1371, 1744 (Merch. Tale); and the Tale of
Melibeus, B 2291.

251. _Ionathas_, Jonathan; remarkable for his 'friendliness' towards David;
1 Sam. xix. 2.

252. _Penalopee_, Penelope, wife of Ulysses; see the note to Book of the
Duch. 1081; and Ovid, Her. i. _Marcia Catoun_, formerly said to be Marcia,
wife of M. Cato Uticensis [not Cato the Censor, as Bell says]. Bell notes
that 'her complaisance, apparently, in consenting to be lent to Cato's
friend, Hortensius, is the ground of her praise in this place.' Gilman
refers us to Clough's tr. of Plutarch, iv. 394, where the story is given.
This, however, is not the right solution. Prof. Lounsbury (Studies in
Chaucer, ii. 294) points out that the reference is clearly to Marcia,
_daughter_ of the same Cato, because Chaucer got the story from Hieronymus
contra Iovinianum (i. 46), where we find:--'Marcia Catonis filia minor,
quum quæreretur ab ea, cur post amissum maritum, denuo non nuberet,
respondit, non se inuenire uirum, qui se magis vellet quam sua.' A much
better example would have been her sister Porcia, the devoted wife of
Marcus Brutus (Jul. Cæsar, ii. 1).

254. _Isoude_, the heroine of the romance of Sir Tristram; see Parl. of
Foules, 288 (and the note on the line); also Ho. Fame, 1796. _Eleyne_,
Helen, heroine of the Trojan war.

255. Note how the original refrain of this Balade, beginning 'Alceste is
here,' is altered to 'My lady cometh'; in order to prevent the premature
mention of Alcestis' name. See note to A. 179 above, following the note to
l. 242. _Disteyne_, bedim; viz. by outshining them.

257. _Lavyne_, Lavinia, the heroine of the latter part of the Æneid; cf.
Book of the Duch. 331; Ho. Fame, 458. _Lucresse_, Lucretia of Rome, whose
'Legend' is related at length below; l. 1680. Cf. Cant. Tales, F 1405.

258. _Polixene_, Polyxena, daughter of Priam, who, like Lucretia, bought
love too dearly; for she was sacrificed on the tomb of Achilles, according
to Ovid, Met. xiii. 448. But according to Guido delle Colonne, whom Chaucer
probably regarded as a better authority, she was slain by Pyrrhus. Cf. Book
of the Duch. 1071. Note also:--'Alas, your love, I bye hit al to dere';
Anelida, 255.

259. _Cleopatre_, Cleopatra; whose Legend is the first of the series below:
l. 580.

261. _Tisbe_, Thisbe; whose Legend follows that of Cleopatra; l. 706.

263. _Herro_, Hero of Sestos, beloved by Leander; see Ovid, Her. xviii,
xix. Spelt _Erro_, Pref. to Man of Law, B 69; whence we learn that the
Legend of Hero was intended to be one of the set. _Dido_; whose Legend
occurs below; l. 924. _Laudomia_, Laodamia, wife of Protesilaus; see Ovid,
Her. xiii. Spelt _Ladomea_, and accented (as here) on the _o_; Pref. to Man
of Law, B 71. And see Cant. Tales, F 1445.

264. _Phyllis_; whose Legend occurs at l. 2394.

265. _Canace_, daughter of Æolus, beloved by Macareus; see Ovid, Her. xi.
See Pref. to Man of Law, B 78; whence we learn that Chaucer had _no_
intention of including her Legend in the set, but expressly rejected it.
_Chere_, sad countenance.

266. _Ysiphile_, Hypsipyle; whose Legend occurs at l. 1368.

268. _Ypermistre_, Hypermnestra; whose Legend occurs at l. 2562.

_Adriane_, Ariadne; whose Legend occurs at l. 1886.

For further remarks, see my long note to the Man of Law's Tale, B 61.

270. Bell remarks that the above beautiful Balade has been often imitated;
and cites a poem by Surrey with the title 'A Praise of his Love, wherein he
reproveth them that compare their ladies with his,' and beginning--'Geue
place, ye louers, here before That spent your bostes and bragges in vaine.'
See Tottell's Miscellany, ed. Arber, p. 20. Another such poem occurs in the
same collection, at p. 163; beginning--'Geue place, you Ladies, and begon';
this, it appears, was written by John Heywood; Warton, Hist. E. Poet.
(1840), iii. 56 (note). With respect to Surrey's verses, Warton (Hist. E.
P. 1840, iii. 33) remarks that 'the leading compliment, which has been used
by later writers, is in the spirit of Italian fiction.' But it is probable
that we here see Surrey's original before us. Among the beautiful songs on
this theme, we should not neglect 'You meaner beauties of the night,' by
Sir Henry Wotton. Cf. ll. 274, 275 below.

271. _By_, with respect to. _My lady_ is the queen Alcestis, whose name
Chaucer is supposed not to know as yet. See l. 432.

277. See note to l. 186 above.

278. _Nadde_ = _ne hadde_. 'For, had not the comfort of her presence
existed.' We should now say, 'Had it not been for the comfort.' Cf. Spec.
Eng. Literature, pt. iii. note to § xv (_b_). l. 96.

295. _For the nones_, for the once, for this special occasion. See the note
to Chaucer's Prologue, l. 379. The phrase was first explained, carefully
and fully, by Price, in a note to Warton's Hist. Eng. Poet. ed. 1840, ii.
74, 75.

298. 'That bears away the prize from us all in external beauty or figure.'
_Our alder_, of us all; where _our_ = A.S. _úre_, gen. pl. of the first
personal pronoun, and _alder_ is a more emphatic form of _aller_ (A.S.
_ealra_), gen. pl. of _all_. See Chaucer's Prol. 586, 710, 799, 823. Hence
_alderliefest_, dearest of all, in 2 Hen. VI. i. 1. 28; probably borrowed
from _alderlevest_ in Chaucer's Troilus, v. 576 (in vol. ii.). Prof. Corson
cites _altherbeste_, best of all, from Gower, C. A. ed. Pauli, i. 106;
_althermest_, most of all, from the same, i. 147; _althertrewest_, id. i.
176; _altherwerst_, id. i. 53. In Chaucer's Minor Poems the reader will
find _our alder_, of us all, ABC, 84; also _alderbeste_, Book Duch. 246;
_alderfaireste_, id. 1050; and _aldernext_, Parl. Foules, 244.

300. _A-compas enviroun_, in a circle, all round about.

304. _By and by_, one after another, in order; see the New E. Dict.

307. _Furlong-wey_, lit. two minutes and a-half; or the time of walking a
furlong, at 3 miles an hour. See Anelida, 328; Ho. Fame, 2064.

314. _Hit am I_, it is I; the usual M.E. idiom. See Kn. Tale, A 1736; Man
of Law's Tale, B 1109, and note. _Him neer_, nearer to him: _neer_ is the
comparative of _neh_ or _nigh_; cf. l. 316.

318. Dante has 'che noi siam vermi'; Purg. x. 124.

323. _Servaunt_ in Chaucer frequently means 'lover'; such is necessarily
the case here.

329. Chaucer here certainly seems to imply that he translated the whole of
the Romance of the Rose, or at any rate that part of it which is especially
directed against women. The existing English version consists of three
fragments, apparently by different authors, and I see little reason for
connecting more than fragment A (ll. 1-1705) with Chaucer. None of the
fragments contain such passages as the God of Love would most have objected
to; but we find some of them practically reproduced in the Prologue to the
Wyf of Bathes Tale. We also find numerous imitations of passages from that
poem scattered up and down throughout Chaucer's works; and it is remarkable
that such passages usually lie outside the contents of the English
fragments. Where they do not, Chaucer frequently varies from the English
version of the Romance. Thus where Chaucer (Book Duch. 419) has:--

 'And every tree stood by himselve
  Fro other wel ten foot or twelve.
  So grete trees, so huge of strengthe'--

the Eng. version of the Rom. of the Rose (1391) has:--

 'These trees were set, that I devyse,
  Oon from another, in assyse,
  Five fadome or sixe, I trowe so,
  But they were hye and grete also.'

We may here note the variation between _ten foot or twelve_ and _five fadom
or six_; the original has _cinq toises, ou de sis_. Other passages in the
Book of the Duchesse which resemble the existing E. version of the Rom. of
the Rose are these. (1) Book Duch. 424; cf. R. R. 1396. (2) Book Duch. 291;
cf. R. R. 49. (3) Book Duch. 410; cf. R. R. 59. (4) Book Duch. 283; R. R.
7. (5) Book Duch. 340; R. R. 130. (6) Book Duch. 1152; R. R. 2084.

For a fuller discussion of this question, see the Pref. to Ch. Minor Poems,
in vol. i. p. 1.

--A. 260. _Paramours_ seems to be an adverb here, meaning 'with a lover's
affection.' So in the Kn. Tale, A 1155:--

 'For _par amour_ I loved hir first er thow.'

And again, in A 2112:--

 'Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knight
  That loveth _paramours_, and hath his might.'

So also in Troilus, v. 158, 332, and in Barbour's Bruce, xiii. 485--'he
lufit his [Ross's] sistir _paramouris_.' Tyrwhitt quotes from Froissart,
bk. i. c. 196--'Il aima adonc _par amours_, et depuis espousa, Madame
Ysabelle de Juiliers.'

The following phrase 'too hard and hot' merely intensifies the sense of
_paramours_.

332. _Criseyde._ The allusion is to Chaucer's long poem entitled _Troilus
and Criseyde_ (or _Creseyde_). The A-text is more outspoken here, as it
alludes to the inconstancy of the heroine in direct terms.

--A. 280. _Valerie_, Valerius; see note to A. 281 below.

_Titus_; Titus Livius; see l. 1683, and the note. _Claudian_; Claudius
Claudianus, who wrote, amongst other things, a poem De Raptu Proserpinae,
to which Chaucer refers; see Ho. Fame, 449, 1509. He flourished about A.D.
400.

--A. 281. _Ierome_; Hieronymus, usually known as St. Jerome, a celebrated
father of the Latin Church; died Sept. 30, 420. In the Wyf of Bathes
Prologue (C. T. 6251, Group D, l. 669) we find:--

 'He hadde a book, that gladly, night and day,
  For his desport he wolde rede alway;
  He cleped it Valerie and Theofraste,
  At whiche book he lough alwey ful faste.
  And eek ther was somtyme a clerk at Rome,
  A cardinal, that highte Seint Ierome,
  That made a book agayn Iovinian'; &c.

In Tyrwhitt's Introductory discourse, he says of this Prologue--'The
greatest part must have been of Chaucer's own invention, though one may
plainly see he had been reading the popular invectives against marriage and
women in general; such as, the Roman de la Rose; Valerius ad Rufinum _de
non ducenda uxore_; and particularly Hieronymus _contra Iovinianum_.' He
adds, in a note--'The holy Father, by way of recommending celibacy, has
exerted all his learning and eloquence (and he certainly was not deficient
in either) to collect together and aggravate whatever he could find to the
prejudice of the female sex. Among other things he has inserted his own
translation (probably) of a long extract from what he calls "Liber aureolus
Theophrasti de nuptiis."

'Next to him in order of time was the treatise entitled _Epistola Valerii
ad Rufinum de non ducenda uxore_ (MS. Reg. 12 D. iii.). It has been
printed, for the similarity of its contents, I suppose, among the works of
St. Jerome, though it is evidently of a much later date.... To these two
books _Jean de Meun_ has been obliged for some of the severest strokes in
his [part of the] _Roman de la Rose_; and Chaucer has transfused the
quintessence of all the three works, upon the subject of Matrimony, into
his _Wife of Bathes Prologue_ and _Merchant's Tale_.'

Tyrwhitt further observes that the _Epistola Valerii_ was written,
according to Tanner, by Walter Map; of this there appears to be no doubt.
Lounsbury (Studies, ii. 276) takes _Valerie_ to mean Valerius Maximus,
which is here improbable.

It is, at first, not very clear why the God of Love is here represented as
appealing to books _against_ women; but we are bidden to observe that, even
there, good women are incidentally mentioned; see A. 284. Even Valerius
praises Lucretia and Penelope.

--A. 288. Cf. the long passage in the Franklein's Tale about chaste women;
C. T. 11676-11766 (F 1364-1456). It is nearly all taken from Jerome.

--A. 305. _Epistels_ rather than _epistelle_ in the singular. The reference
is to Ovid's Heroides, which contains twenty-one love-letters. Cf.
Chaucer's Introd. to Man of Law, B 55, where he alludes to Ovid's mention
of lovers 'in his _Epistelles_.'

--A. 307. _Vincent_ is Vincent of Beauvais, who compiled an encyclopædia of
universal knowledge in the 13th century. One portion of this great work,
treating of universal history, is called _Speculum Historiale_, which
Chaucer has here turned into _Storial Mirour_. See Lounsbury's Studies in
Chaucer, ii. 375.

338. As Chaucer is pleased to call his poem by the name of 'seintes legende
of Cupyde' in the Introd. to Man of Law, B 61, he here turns Venus into a
saint, to keep up the analogy between his present undertaking and the
Legenda Sanctorum. But John de Meun had previously said much the same
thing. In Le Rom. de la Rose, 10863, Cupid is made to swear 'par _sainte_
Venus ma mere.' See the Eng. version, l. 5953. (Perhaps read _seynte_ in
Text B.)

343. In accordance with the proverb--'Audi alteram partem.' See A. 325. Cf.
Seneca, _Medea_, 195.

348. 'And even if you were not an omniscient god.'

352. From the Rom. of the Rose; the E. version has (ll. 1050, 1):--

 'Hir court hath many a losengere,
  And many a traytour envious.'

Again repeated in Cant. Tales, B 4515-8.

353. _Totelere_ (C. _totulour_), tattling; properly a sb., meaning
'tattler,' but here used in apposition, and, practically, as an adjective.
Tyrwhitt explains it by 'whisperer.' Halliwell quotes 'Be no _totiler_'
from MS. Bibl. Reg. 17 B. xvii. fol. 141. It clearly means a gossiping
tattler, or tale-bearer.

The word is scarce, but we find a helpful passage in P. Plowman, B. xx.
297:--

 'Of alle taletellers and _tyterers_ in ydel.'

Here _tyterers_ means gossipers, or retailers of tittle-tattle; and various
readings give the forms _titeleris_ (as printed by Wright) and _tutelers_
(as printed by Crowley). The last form _tuteler_ is clearly identical with
Chaucer's _totelere_, spelt _tutelere_ in MS. Arch. Selden B. 24.

357. 'These are the causes why, if I am not to lie'; &c. See note to l.
217.

358. _Lavender_, laundress, washerwoman; (Bell's interpretation of 'gutter'
is utter nonsense). See _Laundress_ in my Etym. Dict., where I refer to the
present passage. _Laundress_ is formed by adding _-ess_ to _launder_ or
_laundre_, the contracted form of _lavender_ as here used. In Barbour's
Bruce, ed. Skeat, xvi. 273, 292, the word for 'washerwoman' is spelt
_lauender_, _laynder_, and _landar_. Palsgrave's Eng. and Fr. Dict.
gives--'_Laundre_, that wassheth clothes; _lauendiere_'; and Cotgrave
explains the Fr. _lauandiere_ by the Eng. _launderesse_. Chaucer's
presentation to us of Envy as the person who washes all the dirty linen in
the court, is particularly happy. As a matter of fact, he is here quoting
Dante, but he has substituted _lavender_ (perhaps in an ill sense, though I
do not feel sure of this) for the _meretrice_ of the original. The passage
referred to is in the Inferno, xiii. 64:--

 'La meretrice, che mai dall' ospizio
    Di Cesare non torse gli occhi putti,
    Morte comune, e delle corti vizio,
  Infiammò contre me gli animi tutti.'

Cary's translation has:--

 'The harlot, who ne'er turned her gloating eyes
  From Cæsar's household, common vice and pest
  Of courts, 'gainst me inflamed the minds of all.'

Gower (C. A. ed. Pauli, i. 263) says:--

 'Senec witnesseth openly
  How that envie properly
  Is of the court the comun wenche.'

Note that _parteth_ in l. 359 means 'departeth.'

361. 'Whoever goes away, at any rate she will not be wanting.' Men come and
go, but Envy remains. This is the right sense; but Bell, whom Prof. Corson
follows, gives it quite a false twist. He says, 'Whosoever goes, i.e.
falls, she will not be in want'; a desperate and unmeaning solution, due to
not appreciating the force of the verb _to want_, which here simply means
'to be absent,' and can be applied to _persons_ as well as to _things_.
'There _wanteth_ but a mean to fill your song'; Two Gent. of Verona, i. 2.
295; 'though bride and bridegroom _wants_,' i.e. are absent, Tam. Shrew,
iii. 2. 248: 'There _wanteth_ now our brother of Gloucester here'; Rich.
III. ii. 1. 43.

364. 'But only because he is accustomed to write poems.'

366. 'Or it was enjoined him by some patron to compose those two poems (the
Romaunce of the Rose and Troilus; _see_ A. 344); and he did not dare to
refuse.'

371. _As thogh that_, as he would have done if.

372. _And had_, i.e. and had composed it all himself.

374. 'The allusion is to the several successful adventurers, like the
Visconti, who in the 13th and 14th centuries succeeded in seizing upon the
governments of Milan, and other free cities of Lombardy'; Bell. See the
article _Visconti_ in the Eng. Cyclopædia; we are there referred to Verri,
Storia di Milano, and to Muratori, Annali d' Italia. Cf. Dante, Inf.
xxviii. 74, 81; and see Chaucer's reference to 'Barnabo Viscounte' in the
Monkes Tale, B 3589.

375. _Reward at_, regard to. _Reward_ and _regard_ are etymologically
identical. Observe the accent on the _former_ syllable. Cf. l. 399.

378. _Fermour_, a farmer of taxes; who is naturally exacting and
oppressive.

380. Before _is_ supply _hit_, which, as in l. 379, refers to a suppliant
culprit. His own vassals are a lord's treasures, to be cherished, not
oppressed.

381. Bech refers us to Seneca, De Clementia, lib. i. c. 3, § 3; c. 5, § 4.
Or perhaps Aristotle is meant, whose supposed advice to Alexander is fully
given in Gower's Confessio Amantis, bk. vii. See particularly the passage
in Pauli's edition, iii. 176:--

 'What is a king in his legeaunce,
  Wher that ther is no law in londe?'

There is a similar long and tedious passage in Lancelot of the Laik, ed.
Skeat, ll. 1463-1998. Gower calls Aristotle 'the philosophre'; C. A. iii.
86. We may also compare Hoccleve, De Regimine Principum, ed. Wright, pp.
102-3, translated from Ægidius, De Reg. Princ., lib. i. pars 1, cap. xiv;
where the reference to Aristotle is:--'Propter quod V. Ethicorum scribitur,
quod _principatus uirum ostendit_.'

384. _Al_, although. 'Although he will preserve their rank for his lords.'
Note that _his lordes_ is in the dative case. It was probably from not
observing this that Thynne's edition and the Pepys MS. have needlessly
inserted the word _in_ before _hir_. Cf. A. 370.

387. _Half-goddes_, demi-gods. Cf. 'the demi-god Authority'; Meas. for
Meas. i. 2. 124.

391. So, in his Epitaph on Inigo Jones, Ben Jonson says:--'The Libyan lion
hunts no butterflies'; which he took from Martial, Epig. xii. 61. 6. And
see Pliny, Nat. Hist. viii. 16.

397. _Areste._ Bell seems to suggest the sense of 'restraint,' and Prof.
Corson, following him, suggests 'self-command'; but such a sense does not
exactly appear in Murray's Dictionary. Nevertheless, 'self-restraint' suits
not only this passage, but also the passage cited from the Harleian MS. in
the foot-note to the Somnour's Tale, D 2048, in vol. iv. p. 381.

399. Here, as in l. 375, _reward_ means 'regard,' and is accented on the
_e_.

400. _Maystrie_, masterly act; _no maystrie_, an easy matter.

405. This is not altogether a metaphorical expression. We remember
something very like it at the siege of Calais in 1347, when, according to
Froissart, Edward III. sent for the six inhabitants of Calais, who were to
present themselves 'with bare heads and feet, with ropes round their
necks'; see Froissart, tr. by Johnes, bk. i. c. 145.

415. In the earlier text (A 403), the word _He_ stands alone in the first
foot, which is less pleasing.

417. See Introd. to the Minor Poems (in vol. i.) for a discussion of some
of the poems here mentioned. He here mentions, first of all, three of his
lesser poems, in the order of their length; viz. the Hous of Fame, the
Deeth of Blaunche, and the Parlement of Foules.

420. The 'Palamoun and Arcyte' here referred to was no doubt a translation
of Boccaccio's Teseide, or of selections from it, in seven-line stanzas.
Though not preserved to us in its entirety, several fragments of it remain.
These are to be found (1) in sixteen stanzas of the Parl. of Foules (ll.
183-294), translated from the Teseide, bk. vii. st. 51-66; (2) in part of
the first ten stanzas of Anelida, from the same, bk. i. st. 1-3, and bk.
ii. st. 10-12; (3) in three stanzas near the end of Troilus (viz. st. 7, 8,
and 9 from the end), from the same, xi. 1-3; and (4) in a re-written form,
in what is now known as the Knightes Tale. See Notes to Anelida, in vol. i.
pp. 529, 530.

421. 'Though the story is little known.' Tyrwhitt remarks that these words
'seem to imply that it [Chaucer's original version of Palamon and Arcite]
had not made itself very popular.' Unfortunately, Tyrwhitt, who so very
seldom goes astray, has here misled nearly all who have consulted him.
Chaucer is not referring to his own version of the story, nor even to
Boccaccio's version, but to the old story _itself_; and he is merely
repeating Boccaccio's own remark, when (in the Teseide, i. 2) he speaks of
it as

         '--una storia antica,
  Tanto negli anni riposta e nascosa,
  Che Latino autor non par ne dica,
  Per quel ch'io senta, in libro alcuna cosa.'

And, in truth, the story must have been known but to very few, till
Boccaccio rescued it from oblivion. This is all that is meant; and there is
no difficulty. Note further that Chaucer refers to the very same passage in
another poem; see note to Anelida, l. 8.

423. A Balade is, properly, a poem in three stanzas, in which each stanza
ends with the same line, called the refrain. There is also usually a fourth
stanza, called _Lenvoy_, or the Envoy, which is sometimes shorter than the
other three. Most of Chaucer's Balades have probably perished, as only a
few are now known. These are: _Fortune_, consisting of 3 Balades, each in
8-line stanzas, followed by a single Envoy; _Truth_, a Balade with Envoy,
in 7-line stanzas; _Gentilesse_, without Envoy; _Lak of Stedfastnesse_,
with Envoy; (probably) _A Balade against women unconstaunt_, without Envoy;
_The Complaint of Venus_, consisting of 3 Balades, with a general Envoy;
_The Compleint to his Purse_, with Envoy of five lines only; _To
Rosemounde_, without Envoy; and the Balade included in the present poem, at
ll. 249-269 above.

A _Roundel_ is a poem of from nine to fourteen lines, in which only eight
lines are different from each other, the rest being repetitions of lines
that have already occurred. See this fully explained in the note to l. 675
of the Parl. of Foules. The one certain example is the Roundel included in
the Parl. of Foules, beginning at l. 680. There is also a beautiful example
of a Triple Roundel, which I have included in the Minor Poems, with the
title of Merciless Beauty. No doubt Chaucer wrote many more, but they are
lost.

A _Virelay_ is a poem in an unusual metre, of which examples are very rare.
Only one entire poem of this character has been conjecturally assigned to
Chaucer, but it is written in later English, and cannot possibly be his. It
is not a true Virelay (in the French sense), and first appeared in the
edition of 1561; see vol. i. p. 33. In this poem, lines 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
all rime together; and l. 4 rimes with l. 8. Then comes the 'veer' or
'turn,' which requires that, in the next stanza, lines 9, 10, 11, 13, 14,
15 shall rime with lines 4 and 8, as, in fact, they do; but lines 12 and 16
introduce a _new_ rime, as they should _not_ do. We find, however, two fair
examples of the Virelay in the poem of Anelida, viz. in lines 256-271 and
317-332. In the former of these, the rime in _-ee_ (_-e_) appears in lines
256-8 and 260-2, and the rime in _-yte_ ends lines 259 and 263; whereas,
conversely, the rime in _-yte_ ends lines 264-6 and 268-270, whilst lines
267 and 271 repeat the rime in _-ee_. Similarly, ll. 317-332 exhibit
veering rimes in _-eye_ and _-ure_.

In Hoccleve's Poems, ed. Furnivall (Early Eng. Text Soc., Extra Series,
1892), there are several clever and intricate examples of the Virelay.
Thus, in Balade IV, at p. 39, there are five stanzas, but only three rimes,
viz. in _-al_, _-ee_, and _-ay_. The formula of rimes, for the first and
third stanzas, is _a b a b b c b c_; for the second and fourth stanzas, _c
b c b b a b a_; and for the fifth stanza, _a c a c c b c b_. See also the
same, pp. 41, 47, 49, 58, 59, 61, 62. Beyond all doubt, Hoccleve copied the
forms of Chaucer's lost virelays.

424. _Holynesse_, holy employment, religious composition. This is, clearly,
an intentional substitution for the _besinesse_, i.e. 'laborious
employment,' in the A-text, l. 412.

425. Chaucer made an excellent prose translation of Boethius de
Consolatione Philosophiæ, a Latin treatise much admired in the middle ages,
and still worthy of admiration. For further remarks, see vol. iii.

--A. 414. This is the only notice we possess of a work by Chaucer which is
no longer extant. We gather from it that he made a translation of the Latin
prose treatise by Pope Innocent III., entitled De Miseria Conditionis
Humanæ, a gloomy enumeration of human woes without a single alleviating
touch of hope, fiercely and unrelentingly set forth. It is probable that it
was written in 7-line stanzas; for portions of it appear to be preserved in
the Prologue to the Man of Lawes Tale, B 99-126, and in other stanzas of
the same (B 421-7, 771-7, 925-931, 1135-8).

426. _The Lyf of Seynt Cecyle_ is happily preserved. It was one of
Chaucer's early productions; but he himself rescued it from possible
disappearance by introducing it into the Canterbury Tales, with the title
of the Second Nonnes Tale.

428. This is another of the lost works. We gather that he made a
translation from a piece attributed to Origen, one of the most eminent of
the early Christian writers, who was born at Alexandria in 186. Tyrwhitt
says the piece meant is doubtless 'the Homily _de Maria Magdalena_, which
has been commonly, though falsely, attributed to Origen; see Opp. Origenis,
Tom. ii. p. 291, ed. Paris, 1604.' Tyrwhitt adds, very justly and
incontrovertibly--'I cannot believe that the Poem entitled The Lamentation
of Marie Magdaleine, which is in all the [older] editions of Chaucer, is
really that work of his. It can hardly be considered as a translation, or
even as an imitation, of the Homily; and the composition, in every respect,
is infinitely meaner than the worst of his genuine pieces.'

432. Here, in the B-text, the name of Alcestis is first mentioned; yet
strange to say, Chaucer does not realise who she is till later; see l. 518.
She was the wife of Admetus, not king of Thrace (as here said) but of Pheræ
in Thessaly. Apollo obtained from the Moiræ a promise to grant Admetus
deliverance from death if, at the hour of his death, his father, mother, or
wife, would consent to die for him. Alcestis consented to die in his stead,
and is therefore here taken as the chief type of wifely devotion. The
mention of Alcestis in the Court of Love, st. 15, is merely copied from
Chaucer; so also Lydgate's use of _Alceste_ to mean 'a daisy,' in his
Legend of St. Edmund, l. 235 of the additional stanzas found in MS. Ashmole
46, as printed in Horstmann, Alteng. Legenden, Neue Folge (1881), p. 443.
Gower has the story of Alcestis in his Confessio Amantis; ed. Pauli, iii.
149.

452. An allusion to the common proverb--'Bis dat, qui cito dat'; he who
gives at once, gives twice. Publius Syrus has: 'Bis gratum est, quod dato
opus est, ultro si offeras,' v. 44; and again: 'Inopi beneficium bis dat,
qui dat celeriter'; v. 235.

465. 'Has no participation in the deed of a thief.' Similarly, in the Squi.
Tale, F 537, Chaucer tells us that 'A trew wight and a theef thenken nat
oon,' i.e. do not think alike. _Trew_ means 'honest.'

466. The first foot contains _Ne a trew-_; _e_ in _Ne_ is elided.

475, 6. Closely imitated in the Court of Love, st. 61:--

 'And argue not for reason ne for skill
  Againe thy ladies pleasure ne entent,
  For love will not be counterpleted indeede.'

The substitution of the dissyllabic _indeede_ for Chaucer's monosyllabic
_be_ just ruins the scansion of the line; but we must not expect always to
find melody in that grossly over-rated poem.

496, 7. Observe that these lines are not in the A-text. They must
necessarily have been added after 1382, when Richard II. married Anne of
Bohemia, and of course long before 1394, when 'the good queen Anne' died,
and her husband at once forsook their favourite residence of Shene, now
Richmond; see Annals of England, p. 201.

499. This is a strange question, seeing that Alcestis has already announced
her name at l. 432; we must suppose that the poet did not realise that she
was _the very_ Alcestis whom he longed to see. But it looks like an
oversight, due to his partially rewriting this Prologue.

503. Literally Chaucer's favorite line; for it reappears three times more,
viz. in the Kn. Ta., A 1761; March. Ta., E 1986; and Squi. Ta., F 479. And,
in the Man of Law's Tale, B 660, we have--'As gentil herte is fulfild of
pitee.' It is admirable.

510. Here Chaucer seems to be imitating Froissart; see the Introduction. I
cannot find any early account of Alcestis that turns her into a daisy[68].
See notes to ll. 432, 515.

515. Alcestis 'was afterwards brought back from the lower world by
Hercules, and restored to her husband'; Lewis and Short, Lat. Dict. s.v.
_Alcestis_. And see the Introduction.

522. _Bountee_, goodness. See Clerk. Ta., E 157, 415; and Trench, Sel.
Glossary.

526. _Agaton_, Agathon or Agatho; Dante's _Agatone_ (Purg. xxii. 107). An
Athenian poet (B.C. 447-400); who wrote a tragedy called 'the Flower.' See
the Introduction.

531. _Cibella_, Cybela, or more commonly Cybele, a Phrygian goddess, later
worshipped at Rome as Ops or Mater Magna. She was the goddess of the earth,
and especially represented its fertility; hence she is naturally said to
produce flowers. She here answers to the 'Ceres' of Froissart; see the
Introduction.

533. The reference is to the red tips on the white petals of the daisy, the
'wee, modest, crimson-tippèd flower.' This is said to be the gift of Mars,
as he was associated with that colour. He is called 'Mars the rede'; see l.
2589 below; Anelida, l. 1; Kn. Ta., A 1969. The colour of the planet Mars
is reddish.

In the present passage _reed_ is a sb.; 'And Mars gave redness to her
crown.'

539. Referring to the Balade at l. 249. In the A-text, Alcestis was
actually mentioned in the refrain; but Chaucer rewrote it so as to exclude
her name. He now writes (in l. 540) as if he had forgotten to put it in. Of
course ll. 539-541 are peculiar to the B-text, as marked.

542. _Kalender._ 'A kalendar is an almanac by which persons are guided in
their computation of time; hence it is used, as here, for a guide or
example generally'; Bell. The New E. Dict. quotes this passage, and
explains the word by 'a guide, directory; an example, model'; and cites
Hamlet, v. 2. 114--'He is the card or _calendar_ of gentry.' Nevertheless,
I doubt whether this sense arose from the mere _usefulness_ of the
calendar. I believe that Chaucer regarded it in quite another aspect, viz.
as containing the _record_ or _list_ of the saints whose lives are worthy
of imitation. Hence Schmidt explains the word in Hamlet as 'note-book' or
'record'; as is certainly the case in All's Well, i. 3. 4, which Murray
duly quotes with the sense of 'record.' So in the present case _kalender_
does not mean 'example' merely, but _a whole list_ or _complete record of
examples_, which gives the word a much greater force. Compare Chaucer's
ABC, under the letter _K_, and the note (l. 73).

549. We hence learn that Chaucer's nineteenth[69] and last Legend was to
have been the Legend of Alcestis; but he never wrote more than the former
_half_ of the work. Cf. A-text, 532.

555. _Thy balade_; see ll. 249-268; F. and Th. read _my_. We here learn
that the Ladies about whom the Legends were to be written (l. 557) are all
mentioned in the Ballad, which is an important hint. We must of course
remove the names of Absalom and Jonathan; and there is reason for supposing
that we should exclude Esther. Next, we set aside Lucretia, Cleopatra,
Thisbe, Dido, Phyllis, Hypsipyle, Hypermnestra, and Ariadne, whose Legends
we possess; observing at the same time that we also have the Legend of
Philomela (though she is not mentioned), and of Medea, who shares a Legend
with Hypsipyle. The names still left are those of Penelope, Martia, Isoude,
Helen, Lavinia, Polyxena, Hero, Laodamia, Canace, and Alcestis. But this
list only partially agrees with Chaucer's scheme as given elsewhere, viz.
in the Introduction to the Man of Law's Tale. See further in the
Introduction.

574. _The grete_, the substance; as in Book of the Duch. 1242; Parl.
Foules, 35.

575. 'According as these old authors are pleased to treat (them).'

576. _Shal telle_, has to narrate.


I. THE LEGEND OF CLEOPATRA.

It is not clear what account Chaucer followed; see the Introduction. The
chief sources for the history are Plutarch, Appian, Dion Cassius, and
Orosius (bk. vi. c. 19). I shall refer to the Life of M. Antonius in my
edition of Shakespeare's Plutarch (denoted below by Sh. Plut.). Bech points
out that one of Chaucer's sources was Florus; see note to l. 655.

581. Ptolemy XI., or Ptolemy Auletes, king of Egypt, died B.C. 51, leaving
two sons, _both_ called Ptolemy, and two daughters, Cleopatra and Arsinoe.
Cleopatra was then 17 years of age, and was appointed queen of Egypt in
conjunction with her brother, the elder Ptolemy, whom she was to marry; but
she was expelled from the throne by Ptolemy's guardians. In B.C. 47 she was
replaced upon it by Julius Cæsar, but still in conjunction with her
brother. This led to the Alexandrine war, in the course of which this elder
Ptolemy perished. After this, she reigned, nominally, in conjunction with
the _younger_ Ptolemy, to whom also she was nominally married; but he was
still quite a child, and was murdered by her orders in less than four
years, after which she was sole queen, in name as well as in reality.

We thus see that the Ptolemy here mentioned may be either of Cleopatra's
brothers of that name; but it is more likely that Chaucer refers to the
elder of them. Shakespeare also uses the expression 'queen of Ptolemy';
Ant. i. 4. 6.

583. _On a tyme_; viz. not long after the battle of Philippi, which took
place in B.C. 42. 'Antonius, going to make war with the Parthians, sent to
command Cleopatra to appear personally before him when he came into
Cilicia, to answer unto such accusations as were laid against her, being
this: that she had aided Cassius and Brutus in their war against him ...
Cleopatra on the other side ... guessing by the former access and credit
she had with Julius Cæsar and C. Pompey (the son of Pompey the Great) only
for her beauty, she began to have good hope that she might more easily win
Antonius. For Cæsar and Pompey knew her when she was but a young thing, and
knew not then what the world meant; but now she went to Antonius at the age
when a woman's beauty is at the prime, and she also of best judgment.'--Sh.
Plut. p. 174. Almost immediately after this passage follows the celebrated
description of Cleopatra in her barge upon the Cydnus, familiar to all in
the words of Shakespeare; Ant. and Cleop. ii. 2. 196.

591. 'Octavius Cæsar reporting all these things unto the Senate, and
oftentimes accusing him to the whole people and assembly in Rome, he
thereby stirred up all the Romans against him.'--Sh. Plut. p. 202.

592. After the death of his first wife, Fulvia, Antony had married Octavia,
sister of Octavianus (better known to us as Augustus). But in a few years
he deserted her, and surrendered himself wholly to the charms of Cleopatra.
Cf. Ant. and Cleop. iii. 6.

597. Cf. Sh. Plut. p. 192; Ant. and Cleop. i. 4. 55.

605. _Sterve_, to die. See _Starve_, in Trench, Sel. Glossary.

624. _Octovian_, Octavianus. 'Now for Cæsar, he had 250 ships of war,
80,000 footmen, and well near as many horsemen as his enemy Antonius'; Sh.
Plut. p. 207.

634. See the account of the battle of Actium, B.C. 31; in Sh. Plut. p. 210.
The vivid description here given by Chaucer resembles the parallel passage
in the Kn. Tale, A 2600-20, which should be compared. 'The soldiers fought
with their pikes, halbards and darts, and threw halbards and darts with
fire. Antonius' ships, on the other side, bestowed among them, with their
crossbows and engines of battery, great store of shot from their high
towers of wood that were set upon their ships.'--Sh. Plut. p. 211. There is
some description of the hostile fleets and of the battle in Florus (see
note to l. 655), who tells us that, whilst Octavius had 400 ships against
the 200 ships of Antony, the latter were nearly double the size of the
former; so that the fleets were thus of equal strength.

637. Bell says this is 'a ludicrous anachronism'; but it is nothing of the
kind. The word _gonne_ is here used in the sense of 'shot' or 'missile';
and the line means--'with terrible sound out rushes the huge missile,'
being hurled from one of the 'engines of battery' mentioned in the last
note. It is the missile, not the engine, that 'out goth'; as a moment's
reflection would have informed the commentator, whose remark was needless.
The use of _gonne_ in the sense of 'missile' is curious, but not
unexampled; for, in the Avowynge of Arthur, st. 65, we read that 'there
come fliand a _gunne_,' i.e. there came flying along a missile. I believe
it is also used in the sense of missile in Sir Ferumbras, 5176, though the
passage is not decisive.

Even if this were not the case, there is no 'anachronism'; for _gonne_ was
originally used in the sense of 'catapult,' as may be seen by consulting
the Prompt. Parvulorum, where the Latin for it is _petraria_, and
_mangonale_. The _grisly soun_ alludes to the whizzing of the ponderous
missile through the air; Barbour says of a great stone, hurled from a
catapult, that 'It flaw out, quhedirand, with a rout,' i.e. it flew out,
whirring, with a great noise. See The Bruce, xvii. 684.

On the other hand, in Ho. Fame, 1643, Chaucer certainly uses _gonne_ in the
sense of 'cannon'; but that does not affect the sense of the present
passage.

638. _Hurtlen_, push, dash, ram one against the other; cf. Kn. Ta., A 2616.
'Somtyme they _hurtled_ to-gyder that they felle grovelyng on the ground';
Morte Arthure; by Sir T. Malory, bk. vii. c. 12. _Heterly_, vehemently,
fiercely, occurs frequently in the Wars of Alexander, ed. Skeat (E. E. T.
S.) Compare Vergil's description of the battle, in Æn. viii. 689, &c.: 'Una
omnes ruere.'

640. _In goth_, in there go. _Goth_ is singular in form, because of its
position in the sentence; but it has two nominatives, viz. 'grapnel' and
'shearing-hooks.' The former was a contrivance for clutching the ropes, and
the latter for severing them.

642. This is wonderfully graphic. A boarder bursts in with a pole-axe; a
sailor, on the defence, flees behind the mast, then dashes forward again,
and drives the assailant overboard.

646. _Rent_, rendeth; the present tense.

648. By pouring hard peas upon the hatches, they became so slippery that
the boarders could not stand.

649. Some carried pots full of quicklime, which they threw into the eyes of
their enemies. See Notes and Queries, 5 S. x. 188. The English did this
very thing, when attacking a French fleet, in the time of Henry III. Strutt
(Manners and Customs, 1774, ii. 11) quotes from Matthew Paris to this
effect:--'Calcem quoque vivam et in pulverém subtilem reductam, in altum
projicientes, vento illam ferente, Francorum oculos excaecaverunt.' Cf. Æn.
viii. 694.

652. _Put_, short for _putteth_, puts; pres. tense.

653. _To-go_, disperse themselves; pres. tense. The prefix _to_ has the
same force as the Lat. _dis-_, i.e. 'in different directions.' We even find
_to-ga_ used as a past tense in Barbour's Bruce (viii. 351, ix. 263, 269,
xvii. 104, 575), with the sense 'fled in different directions,' or 'fled
away.' Cf. 'the wlcne _to-gað_,' the clouds part asunder; Morris; Spec. of
Eng. pt. I. p. 7, l. 169. And again, 'thagh the fourme of brede _to-go_,'
though the form of bread disappear; Shoreham's Poems, p. 29.

_That best go mighte_, each in the way he could best go; each made the best
of his way to a safe place. 'Sauve qui peut.'

655. 'Suddenly they saw the threescore ships of Cleopatra busily about
their yard-masts, and hoising sail to fly'; Sh. Plut. p. 212. Cf. Ant. and
Cleop. iii. 10. 10; Vergil, Æn. viii. 707-8. The remark about Cleopatra's
'purple sails' may remind us of Plutarch's description of Cleopatra on the
Cydnus, already referred to above (note to l. 583):--'the poop [of her
barge] was of gold, _the sails of purple_'; Sh. Plut. p. 174; Ant. and
Cleop. ii. 2. 198.

The truth is, however, that (as Bech points out) Chaucer has borrowed this
and a few other incidents from L. Annaeus Florus, who wrote an Epitome
Rerum Romanarum in the second century. In relating the battle of Actium, he
says:--'Prima dux fugae regina, cum aurea puppe _ueloque purpureo_, in
altum dedit. Mox secutus Antonius: sed instare uestigiis Caesar. Itaque nec
praeparata in Oceanum fuga, nec munita praesidiis utraque Ægypti cornua,
Paraetonium atque Pelusium, profuere: prope manu tenebantur. Prior ferrum
occupauit Antonius. Regina ad pedes Caesaris prouoluta tentauit oculos
ducis: frustra. Nam pulchritudo intra pudicitiam principis fuit. Nec illa
de uita, quae offerebatur, sed de parte regni, laborabat. Quod ubi
desperauit a principe, seruarique se triumpho uidit, incautiorem nacta
custodiam, in Mausoleum se (sepulcra regum sic uocant) recipit: ibi
maximos, ut solebat, induta cultus, in differto odoribus solio, iuxta suum
se collocauit Antonium: admotisque ad uenas serpentibus, sic morte quasi
somno, soluta est.'--Florus, Epit. Rerum Romanarum, lib. iv. c. 11.

662. Chaucer (following Florus) has hastened the catastrophe. Antony
stabbed himself at Alexandria, in the following year, B.C. 30. See Sh.
Plut. 221; Ant. and Cleop. iv. 14. 102.

672. _Shryne_; for 'solio' in Florus; cf. l. 675. Plutarch says only that
Cleopatra 'did sumptuously and royally bury him with her own hands'; Sh.
Plut. p. 224. Afterwards, however, she 'crowned the tomb with garlands and
sundry nosegays, and marvellous lovingly embraced the same'; Sh. Plut. p.
227. But see the account by Florus, in the note to l. 655.

677. _Dede cors_, dead body; as in l. 876. Chaucer uses _cors_ of the
living body, as, e.g. in Sir Thopas, B 2098.

678. Chaucer seems to think that Florus meant, 'in sepulcrum [suum] se
recipit ... iuxta Antonium.'

679. Shakespeare follows closely the account in Plutarch, except that he
makes mention of _two_ asps, whereas Plutarch mentions but one, called by
Sir Thos. North 'an aspick'; Sh. Plut. p. 227. However, Florus uses the
plural _serpentibus_. Cf. Cower, C. A., iii. 361.

681. Cf. Cleopatra's lament in Sh. Plut. p. 226; Ant. and Cleop. iv. 15.
59; v. 2. 283.

691. Pronounce _unreprovable_, as _unréprovábl'_.

694. _Sene_, evident. Note that this is an adjective (A.S. _gesýne_), and
not the past participle; cf. l. 2655, and note. See also ll. 340, 741, and
my note to the Balade against Women Inconstaunt, l. 13.

696. _Naked._ It looks as if Chaucer took _induta_ (note to l. 655) to mean
'not clothed.' Perhaps he read it as _nudata_.

702. _Storial sooth_, historical truth. The old editions actually put the
comma after _storial_ instead of after _sooth_; and modern editors have
followed them. Surely the editors, in some passages, have never attempted
to construe their own texts.


II. THE LEGEND OF THISBE.

Chaucer follows Ovid, Metamorph. iv. 55-166; and frequently very closely.
The reader should compare the Latin text throughout. For example, Ovid
begins thus:--

 'Pyramus et Thisbe, iuuenum pulcherrimus alter,
  altera, quas Oriens habuit, praelata puellis,
  contiguas habuere domos, ubi dicitur altam
  coctilibus muris cinxisse Semiramis urbem.'

In Golding's translation, fol. 43, back, thus:--

 'Within the town (of whose huge walles so monstrous high and thicke,
  The fame is giuen Semiramis for making them of bricke)
  Dwelt hard together two young folke in houses ioynde so nere,
  That under all one roofe well nie both twaine conuayed were.
  The name of him was Pyramus, and Thisbe call'd was she;
  So faire a man in all the East was none aliue as he.
  Nor nere a woman, mayde, nor wife in beautie like to her.'

This at once explains the allusion to Semiramis, the celebrated but
mythical queen who was said to have surrounded Babylon with walls of
fabulous strength, having a deep ditch outside them. See Orosius, as
translated by King Alfred, in Sweet's A.S. Reader, fourth ed. pp. 28, 29.
Gower tells the same story, and likewise follows Ovid; C. A. i. 324.

718. _Estward_; evidently from Ovid's 'Oriens'; see above.

722. The first foot consists of the single syllable _Mai-_.

725. _Naso_, i.e. Ovid; really named Publius Ouidius Naso.

726. _Réport_; accented on the _e_. _Y-shove_, pushed (into notice); cf. l.
1381.

727. 'Tempore creuit amor'; Met. iv. 60.

730. 'Sed uetuere patres'; id. 61.

735. 'As (to quote the proverb) cover up the glowing coal, and the hotter
the fire becomes.' Ovid has--'Quoque magis tegitur, tanto magis aestuat
ignis'; 64. _Wry_ is in the imperative mood, singular. Cf. Troilus, ii.
538-9.

741. _Sene_, visible; see note to l. 694. _Dere y-nogh a myte_, even in a
slight degree; lit. '(to an extent) dear enough at a mite.' A singular use
of the phrase. Cf. 'dere ynogh a leek'; Can. Yem. Ta., G 795; 'not worth a
myte'; id., G 633.

742. 'Quid non sentit amor?' Met. iv. 68.

745. 'In a tone as low as if uttering a confession.' A curious medieval
touch. Ovid says, 'murmure ... minimo'; 70.

756. 'Inuide, dicebant, paries, quid amantibus obstas?' 73.

763. _Holde_, beholden. 'Nec sumus ingrati'; 76.

773. Chaucer practically transposes the offices of Phoebus and Aurora.

 'Postera nocturnos Aurora remouerat ignes,
  solque pruinosas radiis siccauerat herbas'; 82.

782. _And for_, and because, &c.

783. _For_ stands alone in the first foot. Cf. l. 797.

784. 'Conueniant ad busta Nini, lateantque sub umbra Arboris'; 88. Ll. 786,
787 are explanatory, and added by Chaucer. Ninus, the supposed founder of
Nineveh, was the husband of Semiramis. Cf. Shak. Mid. Nt. Dr. v. 1. 139.

786. Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, i. 403) says that the pt. t. of
_herien_ is _heried-e_, with final _e_. But the form is right; _héried-e_
is hardly pronounceable, and the final _e_ is naturally dropped when the
accent is thrown so far back. The forms of the past tenses of weak verbs
are variable; whether they take a final _e_ or not often depends on the
form of the stem. See Ten Brink, Chaucer's Sprache, § 194.

797. _Y-wimpled_, covered with a wimple, or cloth covering the neck and
fitting close round the face, chiefly worn by nuns. Another medieval touch.
Ovid has 'adopertaque uultum'; 94. See note to l. 813.

798-801. These four lines are mainly original, and quite in Chaucer's own
manner. Ovid has merely 'fallitque suos.'

803. 'Audacem faciebat amor'; 96.

804. _She gan her dresse_, she settled herself, lit. directed herself. Lat.
'sedit.'

810. _Rist_, riseth; pres. tense, as in l. 887. So _arist_, Man of Law's
Tale, B 265.

811. _With dredful foot_; so again in Kn. Ta., A 1479. 'Timido pede fugit
in antrum'; 100. See _Dreadful_ in Trench, Select Glossary; and cf. ll.
109, 404 above.

813. 'Dumque fugit, tergo uelamina lapsa reliquit'; 101. 'For fere, and let
her wimple falle.'--Gower, Conf. Amant. i. 326.

814-6. These three lines are original. _Sit_, sitteth. _Darketh_, lies
close. 'The child than _darked_ in his den'; Will. of Palerne, 17; 'drawe
[drew] him into his den, and _darked_ ther stille'; id. 44. And again in
the same poem, ll. 1834, 2851.

823-31. Considerably expanded from the Latin:--

 'Serius egressus uestigia uidit in alto
  puluere certa ferae, totoque expalluit ore
  Pyramus'; 105.

830. _Agroos_, shuddered; and again in l. 2314; and in Troil. ii. 930. The
infin. _agryse_ is in the Man of Law's Tale, B 614.

834. 'Una duos, inquit, nox perdet amantes'; 108.

835. This line is Chaucer's own.

842. _What_, whatsoever; 'quicunque ... leones'; 114.

847-9. 'Accipe nunc, inquit, nostri quoque sanguinis haustus'; 118.

851-2.

                     'Cruor emicat alte
  non aliter quam quum uitiato fistula plumbo
  scinditur, et tenues stridente foramine longe
  eiaculatur aquas, atque ictibus aera rumpit'; 121.

With much good taste, Chaucer omits the next three lines, just as he has
omitted to tell us that the trysting-tree was 'a faire high Mulberie with
fruite _as white as snow_,' as Golding says. The blood of Pyramus turned
this fruit _black_, and so it remains to this day! Gower likewise
suppresses the mulberry-tree, but Shakespeare mentions it; see Mid. Nt. Dr.
v. 1. 149.

853-61. Admirably expanded out of three lines:--

 'Ecce metu nondum posito, ne fallat amantem,
  illa redit; iuuenemque oculis animoque requirit;
  quantaque uitarit narrare pericula gestit'; 128.

859. The first syllable of _Bothe_ forms a foot by itself. So also in ll.
863, 901, 911, &c.

862-8.

 'Dum dubitat, tremebunda uidet pulsare cruentum
  membra solum; retroque pedem tulit; oraque buxo
  pallidiora gerens, exhorruit aequoris instar,
  quod fremit, exigua quum summum stringitur aura'; 133.

869-82. Fourteen lines where Ovid has eight. Chaucer has greatly improved
l. 882, where Ovid makes Thisbe _ask_ Pyramus to lift up his
head:--'uultusque attolle iacentes'; 144.

887. This line is original. _Bost_, noise, outcry; such is the original
sense of the word now spelt _boast_, which see in the New E. Dict. Cf. 'Now
ariseth cry and _boost_'; King Alisaunder, 5290; and see P. Plowman, C.
xvii. 89. Whitaker, writing in 1813, remarks that _boost_, in the sense of
noise, is 'a provincial word still familiar in the Midland counties.'

894.

 'Persequar extinctum; letique miserrima dicar
  caussa comesque tui'; 151.

905-12. Admirably substituted for Thisbe's address to the mulberry-tree,
requesting it to keep its berries always black thenceforth.

913, 14.

 'Dixit; et aptato pectus mucrone sub imum
  incubuit ferro, quod adhuc a caede tepebat'; 162.

916-23. These lines are original. With l. 917 cf. Le Rom. de la Rose,
14345:--'Mes moult est poi de tex amans.'


III. THE LEGEND OF DIDO.

This Legend purports to be taken from Vergil and Ovid; see l. 928. There is
very little of it from Ovid, viz. only the last 16 lines, which depend on
Ovid's Heroides, vii. 1-8, and ll. 1312-6, which owe something to the same
epistle.

The rest is from the Æneid, bks. i-iv, as will be pointed out.

Note that Chaucer had already given the story of Dido at some length in his
Hous of Fame, 151-382, which should be compared. He mentions Ovid there
also; l. 379.

924. _Mantuan_, born near Mantua. Publius Vergilius [not Virgilius] Maro
was born on the 15th Oct., B.C. 70, at Andes, now Pietola, a small village
near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul; and died Sept. 22, B.C. 19. It is said that
an inscription was placed on his tomb, beginning 'Mantua me genuit.'

926. Cf. 'chi vi fu lucerna?' Dante, Purg. i. 43.

927. _Eneas_, Æneas, hero of the Æneid.

928. The late editions, for some mysterious reason, put a full stop after
_Eneid_ and insert _of_ before _Naso_. The sense is--'I will take the
general tenour (of the story as I find it) in thine Æneid and in Naso,'
i.e. in Ovid; 'and I will versify the chief circumstances.'

Roughly speaking, ll. 930-949 are from the Æneid, bk. ii; ll. 950-957 from
bk. iii; ll. 958-1155 from bk. i; and ll. 1156-1351 from bk. iv.

931. 'By the craft of the Greeks, and especially by Sinon.' Sinon allowed
himself to be taken prisoner by the Trojans, and persuaded them to take in
a wooden horse through the walls, which he said had been made as an
atonement to Minerva for the Palladium carried away by the Greeks. In the
dead of night Sinon let out the armed men concealed within the horse, and
thus Troy was taken by a stratagem. See Æn. ii. 57-267; and cf. Ho. Fame,
152-6.

934. The ghost of Hector appeared to Æneas, and advised him to flee; Æn.
ii. 268-298.

935. The verb agreeing with _fyr_ is _appered_. 'And there appeared also so
mad a fire that it could not be controlled.' See Æn. ii. 311.

936. _Ilioun_, the usual M.E. form of _Ilium_; Æn. i. 68, ii. 241, 325,
625. Ilium is only another name for Troy, but the medieval writers invented
the explanation here adopted by Chaucer, viz. that it was the palace of
Priam, and the _castle_ of Troy in particular. Perhaps they interpreted the
word _domus_ in too narrow a sense in the passage--'O patria, O Divum domus
Ilium'; Æn. ii. 241. This use of the word is invariable in Guido delle
Colonne, author of the Historia Destructionis Troie, a work which was
considered of the highest authority in the middle ages, though it was
shamelessly copied from the French Roman de Troie by Benoit de
Sainte-Maure. In fact, a long description of Priam's palace, called
_Ilion_, is given in the alliterative Troy-book, l. 1629, which is
translated from Guido; and in Lydgate's Troy-book, ed. 1555, fol. F 6,
back, and R 5, back. See the notes to Book Duch. 1070, Ho. Fame, 158, 1467,
1469, 1477.

939. For the death of Priam, killed by Pyrrhus, see Æn. ii. 531-558.
_Fordoon_, slain. _Noght_, nothing; this alludes to Vergil's 'sine nomine
corpus'; Æn. ii. 558.

940. Venus appears to her son Æneas; Æn. ii. 591. Cf. Ho. Fame, 162.

942. Cf. 'dextrae se paruus Iülus [Ascanius] Implicuit'; Æn. ii. 724. See
note to Ho. Fame, 177.

945. _Lees_, lost; 'erepta Creüsa'; Æn. ii. 738; Ho. Fame, 183.

947. _Felawshippe_, company, companions; 'ingentem comitum numerum'; Æn.
ii. 796.

949. _Stounde_, hour, time; usually dissyllabic in M.E.

953. For these adventures, see Æn. bk. iii; which Chaucer passes over. But
see Ho. Fame, 198-221.

959. _Libye_, Libya, on the N. coast of Africa; Æn. i. 158. For the seven
ships saved, see the same, i. 170.

960, 1. These two lines are in no previous edition, (except my own), being
preserved only in MSS. C. and P. But they are obviously genuine and
necessary; otherwise, the word _So_ (l. 962) is meaningless.

962. _Al to-shake_, all shaken to pieces, sorely distressed. Cf. l. 820.

964. Æneas and Achates sally forth, Æn. i. 312; Ho. Fame, 226.

971. _Hunteresse_, huntress; i.e. Venus so disguised; id. i. 319. 'As she
had been an _hunteresse_'; Ho. Fame, 229.

973. _Cutted_, cut short; 'nuda genu'; id. i. 320. The same expression
occurs as 'cutted to the kne' in P. Ploughman's Crede, 296. Compare also l.
434 of the same poem:--

 'His wyf walked him with, with a longe gode [goad],
  In a _cutted_ cote, _cutted_ full hey[gh]e.'

The editions have _knytte_, which is an erroneous spelling either of _knyt_
or of _knytted_; neither of which readings can be right.

978-82. Translated from Æn. i. 321-4.

982. _Y-tukked up_, with robe tucked up; 'Succinctam.' This settles the
meaning of _tukked_ in Ch. Prol. 621.

983-93. Shortened from Æn. i. 325-340.

986. 'Phoebus' sister'; Vergil has 'Phoebi soror'; 329.

994-1001. Alluding to Æn. i. 341-410.

997. _Hit nere but_, it would only be; _nere_ = _ne were_.

998. _Al and som_, the whole matter; wholly and in particulars.

1005. _Sitheo_, so in all the copies. Nothing is commoner than a confusion
between _c_ and _t_ in old MSS.; hence _Sitheo_ is for _Sichco_, i.e.
Sichaeus. Sichaeus (Æn. i. 343) is Vergil's name for Acerbas, a wealthy
Tyrian priest, who married Elissa (Vergil's Dido) sister of Pygmalion.
Pygmalion murdered Acerbas, hoping to appropriate his treasure; but Elissa
fled from Tyre, taking the treasure with her, and founded Carthage. Dante
has the form _Sicheo_; Inf. v. 62.

1010. _Fredom_, liberality; the old sense of _free_ being 'liberal.' _Of_
here means 'for'; in l. 1012 it means 'by.'

1016. _Maister-temple_, chief temple; cf. _maistre-strete_, chief street
(Kn. Ta., A 2902), and _maistre-tour_, chief tower (Squi. Tale, F 226). It
was the temple of Juno; Æn. i. 446.

1022. 'So the book says'; Vergil says that Venus shrouded Æneas and Achates
with a cloud (i. 412, 516).

1024. The first syllable of _Hadden_ forms a foot by itself; cf. l. 1030.
_Ov'r al_ forms the last foot.

1025. 'Uidet Iliacas ex ordine pugnas'; i. 456.

1028. 'Bellaque iam fama totum uulgata per orbem'; i. 457.

1032. _Kepe_, care; usually with a negative; see Kn. Ta., A 2238, 2960.

1035. See Æn. i. 496, &c. Vergil likens Dido to Diana. In l. 1039 Chaucer
uses _god_ in the heathen sense, meaning Jupiter.

1044-6. These lines are original. _Fremd_, strange; A.S. _fremede_. In the
Squi. Tale, F 429, it means 'foreign.' 'To frende ne to _fremmed_,' to
friend nor to stranger; P. Plowm. B. xv. 137. Misspelt _frenne_ (riming
with _glenne_) in Spenser, Shep. Kal. April, 28, with the sense of
'stranger'; unless he means it for _foreign_.

1047-60. Epitomised from Æn. i. 509-612.

1048. _Wende han loren_, he supposed to have lost, he supposed that he had
lost.

1050. _For which_, on which account, wherefore.

1059. _Meynee_, attendants, followers, lit. household; O.F. _meisnee_,
_mesnee_, _meinee_. Very common in Chaucer. The derived adj. _menial_ is
still in use. See l. 1089.

1061-5. From Æn. i. 613, 614. Ll. 1066-1074 are from the same, 588-591.

1075. 'Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco'; id. 630.

1076. The first syllable of _Lyked_ forms a foot by itself. _God do bote_,
may God give (us) help! A parenthetical explanation. All former editions
(except my own) omit the necessary comma after _as_.

1077-85. Chaucer here gives a general outline of the state of the case,
without following Vergil's words.

1086-90. This answers to Æn. i. 615-630.

1091-1102. From Æn. i 631-642.

1099. _His lyve_, in his life, during his life.

1103-27. This passage is, practically, original. Chaucer here tells the
story in his own language, and gives it a wholly medieval cast.

1104. The M.E. _swolow_ usually means 'a whirlpool' or 'gulf,' and such is
Tyrwhitt's explanation. See the Catholicon Anglicum, p. 373, note 1, for
examples. Thus, in Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 97, we find--'_Swolwis_
of the see and _helle_, that resceyuen al that thei may and [gh]elden not
a[gh]en.' Very rarely, it is used of an open mouth; thus in Allit. Poems,
ed. Morris, iii. 250, it is said that the whale 'opened his _swol[gh]_' to
engulf Jonah. Hence, probably, arose the suggestion in Bell's note, that
the reference is to the open mouth of hell, as represented in medieval
drawings. Nevertheless, I believe Tyrwhitt is right; though either sense
will serve. It is the mod. E. _swallow_, used as a sb. Cf. Dante, Inf.
xxxiv. 137-9.

1106. _Parements_, ornaments; probably hangings. Cf. 'chambre of parementz'
in Squi. Ta., F 269, and Tyrwhitt's note, quoted in my note to the line. In
the Kn. Ta., A 2501, _paramentz_ means 'rich clothes.' See Æn. i. 637-9.

1107. For _ornaments_, which is preserved in MSS. C. and T. only, the other
MSS. and all the old editions have the odd reading _pavements_, which is
strangely out of place. I think it clear that this arose from a repetition
of the word _parements_, which was afterwards turned into _pavements_ by
way of desperate emendation. The letters _v_ and _r_ are often somewhat
alike, and have been mistaken for one another, as shewn in my paper on
'ghost-words' in the Phil. Soc. Transactions, 1886.

1109. The MSS. (except T.) and the black-letter editions have _he_.
Morris's, Bell's, and Corson's editions have _she_, which gives no sense,
and will not suit l. 1111. I do not undertake to notice all the vagaries of
the various editions, as the readings of the MSS. are so much more
satisfactory. In the present case, I suppose that _she_ is a mere misprint
in Bell, preserved in the editions that follow him. _Sete_ is short for
_seten_, the usual M.E. pp. of _sitten_, to sit; see Kn. Ta., A 1452. It
answers to the A.S. pp. _seten_, with short _e_. The _e_ in _mete_ was also
short in A.S.; hence the rime is perfect.

1110. Cf. Squi. Ta., F 294--'The spyces and the wyn is come anon.' This
refers to the custom of serving wine mixed with spices to the guests before
going to rest; see a long note in Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, ed. 1840, i. 178
(on the word _piment_); Weber's note on King Alisaunder, 4178; and Our
English Home, p. 85.

1114. The first syllable _Ther_ probably constitutes the first foot of the
line. I believe Chaucer accents _courser_ on the former syllable; see Kn.
Ta., A 1502, 1704; Squi. Ta., F 195, 310.

1117. _Fretted_, adorned; not 'fraught,' as in Corson's note.

1119. _Shynedè_; trisyllabic; in MS. C. only; rest, _shyned_, _shyneth_,
which will not scan. Cf. _lakkedè_, Prol. 756; _knokkeden_, Compl. Mars,
84. Line 2194 has _shinèd_, and l. 1428 has _shoon_. _Shynede_ occurs in
_both_ the Wycliffite versions of Luke ii. 9; and is therefore an old form.
We still have _shined_ as a pt. t. in Ezek. xliii. 2, Acts ix. 3, xii. 7.

1120. 'Nor gentle high-flying falcon for striking herons.' Chaucer has
_gentil faucon_ in his Parl. of Foules, 337. Cotgrave, s.v. _haultain_,
has:--'_Faulcon haultain_, a high-flying hawke.' _Heronere_ means 'used for
flying at herons'; only the best hawks would serve for this.

1122. _Y-bete_, in the Knight's Ta., A 979, means 'ornamented with beaten
gold,' or with gold flattened out by the hammer (F. _or batu_). It might
mean 'ornamented by means of the hammer'; but as 'new florins' can hardly
be said to be used for decorating cups, it seems best to take _with_ in the
sense of 'as well as'; in which case _florins newe y-bete_ means 'florins
newly struck.' The allusion to _florins_ is curious; see note to P.
Plowman, B. iii. 45. Cf. Æn, i. 640--'Ingens argentum mensis, caelataque in
auro Fortia facta patrum.'

1128-35. From Æn. i. 643-656.

1135. _Take_, present, offer, deliver. This sense was once common; see Sec.
Non. Ta., G 223; Can. Yem. Ta., G 1030, 1034, 1365; P. Plowman, B. i. 56,
iv. 58, &c.

1136-49. Much abridged from Æn. i. 657-722.

1145. 'Let it be as it may; I care little about it.'

1150-55. Chaucer here comes to the end of Æn. bk. i, and passes over the
second book with the remark in l. 1153.

1155. _Entendeden_, gave their attention. Corson and Gilman explain it by
'attend,' as if it were the present tense.

1156. Chaucer here passes on to Vergil's fourth book, which he epitomises,
and seldom follows quite exactly.

1157. _Sely_, simple, unsuspecting; see l. 1254. See _Silly_ in Trench,
Select Glossary.

1161. 'Why I have told the story so far, and must tell the rest.'

1163. The reading _his_ (for _her_) in MS. C. can be justified, and may be
right. The A.S. _móna_ was masculine, but the Lat. _luna_ was feminine.
Hence arose a confusion, so that the M.E. _mone_ was of either gender.
Hence, in Chaucer's Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 34, l. 12, we find--'And _nota_,
that yif the mone shewe _himself_ by light of day,' &c.; whereas in the
same, pt. ii. § 40, l. 54, we find--'the mone, loke thou rekne wel _hir_
cours houre by houre; for _she_,' &c.

1166. _Brayd_, start, sudden movement. In the Cursor Mundi, 7169, we read
of Samson, that--

 'Vte of thair handes son he stert
  And gaue a _braid_ sa fers and fast,
  That all the bandes of him brast.'

See _Braid_ in the New E. Dictionary.

1170-81. From Vergil's Æn. iv. 9-29.

1174. 'And eke so likely to be a hero.' _Man_ is here used emphatically;
cf. 'quam forti pectore et armis'; iv. 11.

1182, 3. Cf. Æn. iv. 31-53; but Chaucer cuts it short.

1187. _Love_ (A.S. _lufu_) is here monosyllabic; cf. Kn. Ta., A 1135. 'Love
desires (to have) love; for no one will it desist.' Cf. A.S. _wandian_, to
turn aside, blench, fear. And see _wol_, in l. 1191.

1188-1211. From Æn. iv. 129-159.

1191. _An hunting_, on hunting, a-hunting. Here _an_ is another form of the
prep. _on_, and _hunting_ is a substantive, like Lat. _uenatio_. See Skeat,
Principles of Eng. Etymology, Ser. 1, p. 260.

_Wol_, desires (to go); cf. _wol_ in l. 1187.

1196. _Hoven_, wait in readiness, hover. Cf. 'where that she _hoved_ and
abode'; Gower, C. A. iii. 63; and see P. Plowman, B. prol. 210, xviii. 83.
It just expresses the notion of slight movement, whilst remaining nearly in
the same place. The old editions read _heven_, which gives no sense; for it
never means 'mount,' as has been suggested. Cf. Vergil's 'expectant'; iv.
134.

1198. _Paper-whyt_, as white as paper; a curious and rare compound. Printed
_paper white_ (as two words!) in former editions.

1200. The 4th sense of _Bar_ in the New E. Dict. is--'An ornamental
transverse band on a girdle, saddle, &c.; subsequently, an ornamental boss
of any shape.'

1201. _Sit_, sits. _Wrye_, covered; A.S. _wrigen_, pp.

1204. _Startling_, moving suddenly; the frequentative form of _starting_,
which Chaucer preferred when repeating this same line in his Kn. Tale, A
1502.

1205. _A litel wyr_, i.e. a small bridle-bit. See l. 1208.

1206. _Phebus_; Vergil's 'Apollo'; iv. 144. _To devyse_, to describe (him).

1209. _Wold_, willed, desired; the pp. of _willen_. This form is very rare,
but we again find _hath wold_ in l. 11 of the Compl. of Venus; and _hadde
wold_ in P. Plowman, B. xv. 258. Prof. Corson aptly quotes three examples
from Malory's Morte Arthur, ed. T. Wright, with the references 'vol. i. c.
33, vol. iii. c. 119, and vol. iii. c. 123.' The first of these answers to
bk. ii. c. 8, p. 54 in the 'Globe' edition, where we find--'Then said
Merlin to Balin, Thou hast done thyself great hurt, because thou savedst
not this lady that slew herself, that might have saved her and thou
_wouldest_.' Caxton (ed. 1485) also has _woldest_; but Wright, following
the edition of 1634, has _had would_. For the other passages, see bk.
xviii. capp. 15 and 19, where Caxton has 'and he _had wold_,' and 'and I
_had wolde_.'

1212-31. From Vergil, Æn. iv. 154-170.

1213. _Go bet_, go more quickly, hasten; a term of encouragement. See Pard.
Tale, C 667, and the note. _Prik thou_, spur thou, push on; a like term.
_Lat goon_, let (the dogs) go.

1230. 'Ille dies primus leti, primusque malorum Causa fuit'; iv. 169. It
looks as if Chaucer has translated _leti_ by 'gladnesse,' as if it were
_letitiae_. (Bech makes a similar remark.)

1232-41. These lines are original. Cf. Ho. Fame, 253-292.

1242. Here follows, in Vergil, the celebrated description of Fame, which
Chaucer had already introduced into his Hous of Fame, 1368-1392; it is
therefore here omitted. He passes on to Æn. iv. 195.

1245. _Yarbas_, i.e. Iarbas, son of Ammon; Æn. iv. 196.

1254-84. Original; but see Ho. Fame, 269-292.

1262. _Pilled_, robbed. 'A knight ... sholde deffenden holy chirche, and
nat robben it ne _pilen_ it'; Persones Tale, _De Avaritia_, I 767.

1277. _Ther-as_, whereas. _Sterve_, to die.

1287. Perhaps copied by the author of fragment B. of the Romaunt of the
Rose. We there find (l. 4838, Glasgow MS.)--'The hoote ernes [ernest?] they
al foryeten'; there being nothing answering to it in the French text.

1288. 'And he secretly causes his ships to be prepared'; lit. 'causes (men)
to prepare his ships.'

1289. _Shapeth him_, intends, purposes. See Prologue, 772.

1295. 'Me patris Anchisae ... Admonet ... imago'; iv. 351.

1297. _Mercurie_, Mercury; 'interpres Divûm'; iv. 356.

1305. _What womman_, what sort of a woman.

1310. _Seketh halwes_, repairs to saints' shrines; a curious medieval
touch. Vergil only mentions the sacrifice; iv. 453. Cf. Prologue, 14, and
the note. 'To go _seken halwes_'; C. T. (Wyf of Bathes Prol.), D 657.

1312, 3. 'Si pudet uxoris, non nupta, sed hospita dicar,' &c.; Ovid, Her.
vii. 167.

1316. Cf. 'Sed neque fers tecum'; Her. vii. 79.

1317. _Thise lordes_; 'Nomadumque tyranni'; Æn. iv. 320. Also Pygmalion and
Iarbas, id. 325, 6.

1324. The former syllable of _Mercy_ forms the first foot in the line; cf.
l. 1342. 'Have pitee on my sorwes smerte!' Ho. Fame, 316; which see.

1331. _Lavyne_, Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus; Æn. vii. 359.

1332. _A cloth._ This refers to the Trojan garments left behind by Æneas;
'Iliacas uestes'; iv. 648. The sword is mentioned by Vergil just two lines
above; 646.

1338-40. Here the _cloth_ answers to the Lat. _exuuiae_; and _whyl hit
leste_ = whilst it pleased. These three lines are a close imitation of
Vergil, Æn. iv. 651-3:--

 'Dulces exuuiae, dum fata Deusque sinebant;
  Accipite hanc animam, meque his exsoluite curis;
  Vixi, et quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi.'

We hence see that, in l. 1339, the right reading is _unbind me of this
unreste_, a close translation from the Latin. _Me of_ are run together; see
note to Complaint to Pitè, l. 11.

1341. _Withouten_, without any succour from Æneas.

1346. _Her norice_, her nurse, or rather the nurse of Sichæus, named Barce;
Æn. iv. 632.

1351. 'She roof hir-selve to the herte'; Ho. Fame, 373.

1352. Here Chaucer, having done with Vergil, takes up Ovid, who is intended
by the words _myn autour_.

1354. _A lettre_, i.e. the 7th Epistle in Ovid's Heroides. See l. 1367.

1355-65. From the first 8 lines in the above Epistle.

 'Sic, ubi fata uocant, udis abiectus in herbis,
    ad uada Maeandri concinit albus olor.
  Nec, quia te nostra sperem prece posse moueri,
    alloquor. Aduerso mouimus ista deo.
  Sed merita et famam, corpusque animumque pudicum
    quum male perdiderim, perdere uerba leue est.
  Certus es ire tamen, miseramque relinquere Dido;
    atque îdem uenti uela fidemque ferent.'


IV. (PART I.) THE LEGEND OF HYPSIPYLE.

The chief sources of this fourth Legend are Guido delle Colonne's Historia
Troiana, Ovid's Metamorphoses, bk. vii, and Heroides, letters vi. and xii.
The story of Hypsipyle is also in Statius' Thebaid, bk. v, and in l. 1437
(see note) there is a reference to the Argonauticon of Valerius Flaccus.
See further in the Preface; and see the notes to ll. 1396, 1467.

1368-95. This is a Prologue to the Legend, and is original.

1371. _Reclaiming_, enticement, power to subdue; lit. a calling back.
Halliwell has: 'To _reclaim_ a hawk, to make her gentle and familiar, to
bring her to the wrist by a certain call. It is often used metaphorically,
to tame.' Cf. 'since this same wayward girl is so _reclaimed_'; Romeo, iv.
2. 47.

1373. _Of_, by means of. _Farced_, stuffed; as in Prol. to C. T., 233.

1377. 'Where others betray one, thou betrayest two.'

1381. _Shove_, pushed forward, brought into notice; cf. l. 726.

1383. _Have at thee!_ let me attack (or pursue) thee. _Thyn horn is blowe_,
the horn is blown that summons all to pursue thee; a metaphor taken from
the chase.

1387. _Aboght_, bought; pp. of _abye_, which was corrupted into _abide_;
whence 'thou shalt dearly _abide_ it.'

1388. _Box_, blow, buffet; now only used of 'a box on the ear.'

1389. _Et_, eateth; pres. tense. So in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 135, l.
10, and in Ælfric's Grammar, ed. Zupitza, p. 200.

1391. Prof. Lounsbury would read 'the goodë man that ther-for payede,' and
remarks that this gives a false rime, because the preterite form _payede_
will not rime with the pp. _betrayed_. He adds--'in order to follow the
reading of the one MS. that makes _payed_ a participial form, the adj.
_goode_, of the definite declension, has to be shorn of its final _e_ in
pronunciation.'--Studies in Chaucer, i. 405. I take _good-man_ to be,
practically, one word, as in the A. V., Matt. xx. 11, so that the def. form
of the adj. is not really required. And I prefer the reading _hath payed_,
though it rests on the authority of one (the best) MS. only. If, however,
we adopt the proposed reading, it makes no difference at all to the rime.
For the pt. t. of verbs of F. origin, as _payen_, _serven_, is usually
_payed_, _served_, the full ending _-ede_ (with both syllables sounded)
being extremely rare in Chaucer; cf. note to l. 1119. We even have
_shined_, not _shinede_, in l. 2194, in a word of E. origin. Hence there is
really no fault to be found, whichever reading be taken; and the cricitism,
which is quite superfluous, comes to nothing.

1394, 5. _On_, in the case of. _Y-sene_, evident; as in l. 2655. _By_, with
reference to.

1396. The reading _Guido_ (in MSS. C., T., A.) where the other MSS. and the
editions have _Ouyde_, is important; especially as it is correct, and gives
us a new clue. The Historia Troiana of Guido delle Colonne begins with the
story of Jason, and it is evident that Chaucer follows him, at least as far
as l. 1461. This can easily be seen by comparing the present passage with
the beginning of Book I. of the alliterative Troy-book, ed. Panton and
Donaldson, otherwise called the Gest Historiale of the Destruction of Troy,
which is closely translated from Guido; or else with Lydgate's Troy-book,
bk. i. capp. 1-3. Gower also tells the story of Jason (C. A. ii. 236), and
says that the tale 'is in the boke of Troie write.'

1397. _Pelleus_; so spelt in the allit. Troy-book, l. 104; Gower has
_Peleus_. Medieval names are strangely confused. The right form is not
_Peleus_, but _Pelias_. He was king of Thessaly, half-brother of Æson, and
guardian of Jason. The reading _king_ gives him his title in anticipation,
but is right. So also, in the allit. Troy-book, l. 103: 'There was a _kyng_
in that coste,' &c.; and Guido has 'rex' here.

1398. _Eson_ (as in Gower); Æson, the aged father of Jason.

1420. _Al made he_, although he made.

1425. _Colcos_, properly Colchis, now Mingrelia; between the Caucasus and
the Eastern shore of the Black Sea. In the allit. Troy-book, it is called
_Colchos_, l. 152; and so in Gower. It is not really an island, but Chaucer
follows the Latin text, which has 'insula'; see note to l. 1590.

1430. _Kept_, guarded; _with_, by. Compare the Troy-book, l. 164:--

 'Thus coyntly it kept was, all with clene art,
  By too oxen, oribull on for to loke,
  And a derfe dragon, drede to behold.'

1438. _Oëtes_ (as in Guido); properly _Aeëtes_, Ovid, Her. xii. 51. He was
king of Colchis, and father of Medea.

1447. 'Then should I be bound to requite thy toil.'

1453. _Argus_, the builder of the ship Argo, in which Jason undertook the
voyage. The name is given by Guido (see the E. Troy-book, l. 273), by
Valerius Flaccus, in his Argonauticon, lib. i. 314, and in the Argonautics
of Apollonius Rhodius.

1457. As Bech points out, Chaucer here copies the remark in
Dares:--'Demonstrare cos qui cum Iasone profecti sunt non uidetur nostrum
esse: sed qui uolunt eos cognoscere, Argonautas legant.'--De excidio Troiae
historia, ed. Meister, 1873; cap. 1. The reference is to the Argonauticon
of Valerius Flaccus, lib. i., where the list of the Argonauts may be found.
It also occurs in bk. i. of the Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius. It is a
dreary catalogue; or, as Chaucer says, a sufficiently long tale. There is a
shorter list in Statius, Thebaid, bk. v. All the lists make much of
Hercules (see l. 1454).

1459. _Philotetes_ (so spelt by Guido, see the Eng. version, p. 12, ll. 6
and 10, where the passage from Guido is quoted) was the name of the pilot
to the expedition. Valerius Flaccus identifies him with Philoctetes, son of
Poeas or Pæas; as he introduces him by the name of Poeantius; Argon, i.
391.

1463. _Lemnoun_, Lemnos; it is very common to quote proper names in forms
resembling the accusative case. This, as Chaucer says, is not in Guido, but
in Ovid; see Ovid's Heroid. vi. 50, 117, 136. At the same time it would be
interesting to know _what version_ of Guido Chaucer followed; for it is a
very singular fact, that whilst the story of Hypsipyle is neither in the
alliterative Eng. version, nor in Lydgate, it _does_ occur, at this point,
in a _Spanish_ version, printed at Medina in 1587. There the heading of bk.
ii. c. x. is--'Como Iason aporto co_n_ tormenta a la Isla de Lemos, y caso
con la infanta Hisifile.'

1467. _Isiphilee_, Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, and queen of Lemnos; she
saved her father when the women of Lemnos killed all the other men in the
island, and subsequently entertained Jason. As the letter in Ovid does not
give all the circumstances, perhaps Chaucer consulted Valerius Flaccus,
Argonauticon, lib. ii., and Statius, Thebais, lib. v., or, perhaps, the
Fables of Hyginus, cap. xv.; but he makes more of Hercules than do these
authorities, and seems to be inventing.

1468. _Thoas doghter the king_, the daughter of king Thoas. This is the
usual idiom; see my note to Squi. Tale, F 209.

1469. Cf. Valerius Flaccus, Argon. ii. 311:--

 'Ecce procul ualidis Lemnon tendentia remis
  Arma notant: rapitur subito regina tumultu,
  Conciliumque uocat: non illis obuia tela
  Ferre, nec infestos deerat furor improbus ignes,
  Ni Ueneris saeuas fregisset Mulciber iras.'

In Statius, Theb. v., the Lemnian women receive the Argonauts with
hostility at first, and attack them with missiles.

1476. _Socour_; cf. 'succurrere disco'; Verg. Æn. i. 630.

1479. This is a curious error; _him_ should be _her_. As the Lemnian women
had just killed every man in the island, the messenger must needs have been
a woman. In fact, her name was Iphinoë; Val. Flacc. Argon. ii. 327. The
account in Apollonius Rhodius is somewhat fuller; but I find no mention of
the _cogge_.

1481. _Cogge_, a cock-boat; from the O. Fr. _coque_, also spelt _cogue_, a
kind of vessel, sometimes a ship of war, but also a merchant-vessel, and
here a small boat. See _coque_ or _cogue_ in Godefroy's O. Fr. Dict.
_Cogge_ occurs in the Morte Arthure, 476, 738; Allit. Poems, ed. Morris,
iii. 152; &c. 'Cogboote, cokbote, _scafa_'; Prompt. Parv.

1487. _Broken_, ship-wrecked. 'The ships were _broken_' 1 Kings xxii. 48;
cf. Jonah i. 4. _Oght wo begoon_, in any way distressed. Note resemblances
to the tale of Dido.

1488. _Lodesmen_, pilots; see note to Ch. Prol. 403. 'Lodesman of a shippe,
_pilotte_'; Palsgrave.

1509. Cf. Valerius Flaccus, Arg. ii. 351:--

 'Praecipueque ducis casus mirata requirit
  Hypsipyle; quae fata trahant, quae regis agat uis.'

1514. _Los_; spelt _loos_ in MS. Tn.; for the _o_ is long. It means
'praise' or 'renown,' and occurs six times in Ho. Fame (1620, 1621, 1626,
1722, 1817, 1900). _Los_, with short _o_, means 'loss.'

1515. Read _th'áventúres_, in four syllables.

1528. Prof. Corson cites some parallel passages, viz:--

 'And therto he was _hardy_, _wys_, and _riche_'; Squi. Ta., F 19.

 '_Hardy_, and _wyse_, and _riche_, and therto _free_'; Ship. Ta., B 1366.

 'We alle desyren, if hit mighte be,
  To have housbondes _hardy_, _wyse_, and _free_,
  And _secree_'; Non. Pr. Ta., B 4103.

1529. _Three pointes._ The reference is not to l. 1528, which mentions
_four_ points, but to ll. 1530-3 following. I.e. the three points are
_fredom_, _lustihede_, and being _a greet gentil-man_; or otherwise,
liberality, youthful vigour, and high birth. Cf. l. 1405.

1533. Accent _Tessálie_ on the second syllable.

1535. _Shamefast_ (from A.S. _sceamu_) is here trisyllabic. On the corrupt
modern spelling _shamefaced_ see Trench, Eng. Past and Present.

1536. _He hadde lever_, he would have it dearer, he would rather.

1538-40. In order to scan l. 1538, the word _almighty_ is necessary, though
found in MS. A. only. Or else we must insert _him_, and read--'As wolde God
that I hadde him i-yive.' The sense is--'As (I pray) that God would permit
that I might have given [him] my blood and flesh, provided that I might
still live (to see the result), on the condition that he had anywhere a
wife (suitable) to his rank.' _So that_ means 'provided that'; as in '_so
that_ ye be not wroth,' C. T., D 2248 (Sompnoures Tale), in the Harleian
MS.; and in the following:--

 'Sche saide, sire, ich wille help the,
  _So that_ thou wille spousi me.'--Seven Sages, ed. Weber, 2663.

As to the expression _with the nones_, we may compare it with such
expressions as _with-than_, _with-thon-that_, _with-tho-the_, _with-that_,
all meaning 'provided that,' and all occurring in the Glossary to Spec. of
Eng., Part I. And since _for the nones_ means 'for the occasion' (see
Prologue to C. T., 379), so _with the nones_ is 'with the occasion,' and
hence 'provided that.' I cannot at all agree with what seems to me the
ludicrous emendation in some late editions, which change _nones_ into
_bones_, and delete the comma after _live_; 'provided that I might live
with the bones.' At any rate, there is _no authority_ for this. The old
editions and MSS. all alike read _nones_; and we have the phrase again
(pronounced _with th' non-es_), in the Ho. Fame, 2099.

1546. _To come to hous upon_, to become at home with, to become familiar
with.

1551. The former syllable in _Yiftes_ forms a foot by itself.

1552. _As wolde god_, as (I wish) that God might will or permit; as in l.
1538.

1558. _Thoriginal_, the original. As this 'tells all the case,' i.e. all
Jason's subtlety, he is probably referring to Ovid, Her. Ep. vi. Flaccus
says that Hercules induced Jason to quit Lemnos, and proceed on his voyage.
Statius mentions Hypsipyle's twin sons, and relates some of her later
history.

1564. Chaucer here follows the sixth letter of Ovid's Heroides. Lines
1569-1575 follow four lines of the Latin text, viz. 123-4, and 159-60,
which refer to the twins and Medea:--

 'Si quaeris, cui sunt similes; cognosceris illis.
    Fallere non norunt; caetera patris habent....
  Quam fratri germana fuit, miseroque parenti
    filia; tam natis, tam sit acerba uiro.'


PART II. THE LEGEND OF MEDEA.

1580. From this line to l. 1655 Chaucer mainly follows the second book of
Guido delle Colonne's Historia Troiana, which he epitomises. See Gower, C.
A. ii. 236-258.

1581. 'Who is a devourer of love, and a very dragon'; with reference to the
supposed insatiability of dragons.

1582. 'As matter always seeks to have a definite form, and may pass from
one form into another.' Mr. Archer Hind refers me to Aristotle,
Metaphysica, [LAMDA]. vii. 1072 b. 3:--[Greek: kinei de hôs erômenon,
kinoumenon de talla kinei]. Bech shews that this is all from Guido, who
has: 'Scimus enim mulieris animum semper uirum appetere, sicut appetit
materia semper formam.... Sed sicut ad formam de forma procedere materiam
notum est, sic mulieris concupiscentia dissoluta procedere de uiro ad uirum
... sine fine, cum sit quaedam profunditas sine fundo,' &c. Hence Lydgate,
in his Troy-book, bk. i. c. 5 (fol. C 6, back) has:--

 'For as nature by kyndly appetyte
  Kyndly seketh to sewen after fourme,' &c.

1590. _Iaconitos_, Iaconites. This is a clear proof that Chaucer follows
Guido. At p. 12* of the alliterative Troy-book, ed. Panton and Donaldson,
the following passage is quoted from Guido, lib. ii.: 'In insula igitur
Colcos erat tunc temporis quaedam ciuitas nomine _Iaconites_, caput regni
pro sua magnitudine constituta.' Further extracts from this Latin text are
given by Horstmann, in his edition entitled 'Barbours Legendensammlung,'
vol. ii. (Heilbronn, 1882), p. 221; where will also be found a parallel
passage in a fifteenth-century poem which has wrongly been ascribed to
Barbour. Hence Lydgate, in his Troy-book, bk. i. c. 5 (fol. C 3, back),
says of the chief city of Colchos:--'And Iaconites tho it bare the name.'

1594. Read _Preyíng_; and drop the final _e_ of _moste_.

1597. Compare the allit. Troy-book, ll. 388-391:--

 'The kyng was full curtais, calt on a maiden,
  Bede his doughter come downe, and his dere heire,
  To sit by that semely, and solas to make.
  This mayden full mylde Medea was callid.'

1605. 'And in his mien as royal as a lion.'

1606. _Famulere_, familiar, affable. See Ch. Prol. 215.

1609. 'And, as Fortune owed her an evil mishap.'

1617. Cf. the Troy-book, l. 544:--

 'That causes me with counsell to caste for your helpe,
  And put you in plite your purpos to wyn,
  In sound for to saile home, and your sute all.'

1620. Cf. the same, l. 554:--

 'Now louely and leell, for your lefe speche
  I thanke you a thowsande tymes in my thro hert,
  That ye kythe me suche kyndnes withouten cause why;
  And here I put me full plainly in your pure wille,
  To do with me, damsell, as your desyre thynke.'

1631. _Disioint_, perilous situation, peril. Cf. Kn. Ta., A 2962. 'But sith
I see I stonde in this _disioint_'; Shipman's Tale, B 1601.

1639. Cf. the Troy-book, 942; and 711:--

 'Yow swiftly shall sweire vppon swete goddes,
  This couenaunt to kepe and for no case chaunge.'

 'And swiftly he sware on that swete[70] god,
  All tho couenaundes to kepe, and for no cause let,
  Whill hym lastes the lyffe; he laid on his hond.'

1653. _Unwist of_, unknown to. Cf. Troy-book, 987:--

 'Then leuyt thai the lond, and no leue toke,
  Stale from the styth king stylle by night;
  With the maiden Medea and myche other goodes,
  Thai turne into Tessaile with-outen tale more.'

Here Chaucer ceases to follow Guido, except in ll. 1662-6.

1661. Her name was Creusa; cf. Ovid, Met. vii. 391-6; Horace, Epod. v. 64.

1662. Cf. the Troy-book, l. 718:--

 'And thou hedis not the harme of that hend lady,
  Ne tentes not thy trouth that thou tynt has;
  Soche a maiden to mar that the most louet,
  That forsec hir fader and hir fre londe.'

1667. _Vassalage_, prowess; cf. Kn. Ta., A 3054. It is here used
ironically. Trench refers us to Lydgate's Minor Poems, ed. Halliwell, p.
176:--

 'And Catoun seith, is noon so greet encress
  Of wordly tresour, as for to live in pees,
  Which among vertues hath the _vasselage_.'

1670. _Lettre_, letter; i.e. the 12th letter in Ovid's Heroides; see l.
1678. Lines 1672-7 answer to lines 13, 14, and 19 in Ovid:--

 'Cur mihi plus aequo flaui placuere capilli,
    et decor, et linguae gratia ficta tuae?...
  Quantum perfidiae tecum, scelerate, perîsset!'

1672. _Why lyked me_, why did it please me? But, in l. 1674, _lyked_ is a
personal verb.


V. THE LEGEND OF LUCRETIA.

Chaucer cites Ovid and Livy, and in l. 1873 again appeals to Livy as the
authority. The story is in Livy, bk. i. c. 57-59; and in Ovid, Fasti, ii.
721-852. Chaucer doubtless appeals to Livy as being a professed historian,
but the reader will find that, as a matter of fact, he follows mainly the
account in Ovid from beginning to end, and sometimes almost word for word.
Livy and Ovid were contemporary; the former was born B.C. 59, and died A.D.
17; the latter was born B.C. 43, and died A.D. 18. Gower also tells this
story, and likewise follows Ovid and (near the end) Livy; C. A. iii. 251.

1680. Ovid tells the story of Lucretia under the date Feb. 22 (viii Kal.
Martii), which was commemorated as 'Fuga Tarquinii Superbi,' and begins his
account in the Fasti, ii. 685. Chaucer here borrows from Ovid's first line,
viz.:--'Nunc mihi dicenda est regis fuga.'

Ll. 1680-1693 form Chaucer's own Prologue to the story.

1682. The 'last king' of Rome was Tarquinius Superbus, father of the
Tarquinius Sextus whom Chaucer calls in l. 1698 'Tarquinius the yonge.' The
word _And_, at the beginning of the line, though absolutely necessary to
the sense, is preserved only in MS. Addit. 12524, a bad copy from a good
type. It reads:--'And specially off the last king Tarquinius'; but no other
MS. retains _specially_, and of course it makes the line too long.

1684. 'I do not tell the story for the sake of Tarquin's exile.'

1690. 'St. Augustin, commenting on the story in the milder and more
rational spirit of Christian morality, while he admires the purity of
Lucrece, blames her folly in committing the crime of self-murder as a
punishment on herself for that of which she was really innocent. "Si
adultera," he asks, "cur laudata? Si pudica, cur occisa?" See August. _De
Civitate Dei_, c. xix.'--Bell.

1694. Here Chaucer begins his close copy of Ovid, Fast. ii. 721:--'Cingitur
interea Romanis Ardea signis.' The original should be compared throughout.
_Ardea_, capital of the Rutuli; in Latium.

1696. _Wroghte_, pt. t. 'The siege (or the besiegers) lay before the city
long, and accomplished little'; G. L. Kittredge, Harvard Studies, p. 7.

1698. 'Tarquinius iuuenis'; i.e. Tarquinius Sextus.

1705. _Colatyne._ Chaucer found the name in Livy (or Augustine). Ovid
merely has: 'cui dederat clarum Collatia nomen.' Livy has: 'ubi et
Collatinus cenebat Tarquinius, Egerii filius.' Collatinus was the cousin of
Sextus, and took his name from Collatia, an ancient town of the Sabines, in
the neighbourhood of Rome.

1707. From Ovid: 'Non opus est uerbis, credite rebus, ait.'

1708. From Livy: 'paucis id quidem horis posse sciri, quantum ceteris
praestet Lucretia sua.'

1711. 'That pleases me.' Ovid: 'Dicta placent'; l. 736.

1715. Cf. 'And knew the _estres_ bet than dide this John'; C. T., A 4295
(Reves Tale); and see Kn. Ta., A 1971; also, in particular, the Romaunt of
the Rose, 1448, where the F. text has _l'estre_ (shewing where Ch. found
the word); see vol. i. p. 153.

We may explain _estres_ by 'inner premises' of a house or building.
Godefroy's O. Fr. Dict. gives numerous examples. Cotgrave gives the verb
_estre_, to be; whence the sb. _estre_, a being, substance, state; and then
cites: '_les estres d'une maison_, the inward conveyances, private windings
and turnings within, entries into, issues out of, a house.' The word is
very common in Old French, and not uncommon in Middle English. Gower even
has the sing. _estre_ in the sense of 'state'; C. A. i. 272. Cf. F. 'il
sait tous les êtres de cette maison.'

For all this, the old editions turned the form into _efters_, and Bell
follows them! Moreover, _eftures_ is gravely quoted in Halliwell's
Dictionary, with a reference to Sir T. Malory. The passage is:--'Pleaseth
it you to see the _eftures_ of this castle?' bk. xix. c. 7 (p. 444 in the
Globe edition). Here _eftures_ is a mere misprint (in Caxton's original
edition) for _estres_, due to reading the long _s_  as an _f_. _Efters_ and
_Eftures_ are mere 'ghost-words,' the products of ignorance.

1716, 7. 'Tecta petunt; custos in fore nullus erat'; l. 738.

1720. _Dischevele_, with hair hanging loose. _Malice_, evil.

1721. 'Ante torum calathi _lanaque mollis_ erat'; l. 742. Of course 'our
book' means Ovid; yet Thynne reads 'saith Liui.'

1729. A fine line; but I think Chaucer has wholly misunderstood l. 752 of
the original.

1732-9.

 'Desinit in lacrimas, intentaque fila remittit,
    in gremium uultum deposuitque suum.
  Hoc ipsum decuit: lacrimae decuere pudicae,
    et facies animo dignaque parque fuit'; l. 755.

1740-3. 'Pone metum, ueni, coniux ait. Illa reuixit.'

1745-55. Six lines in Ovid; ll. 761-6.

1757. 'Iam dederat cantus lucis praenuntius ales'; l. 767.

1759-71. Twelve lines in Ovid; ll. 769-80.

1765. _Al to-shake_, wholly tossed about; see l. 962.

1771. 'Or a wicked inclination, with malice.' 'The original meaning (as of
_talento_ in Italian, _talante_ in Spanish) was will, inclination, from
_talentum_ ([Greek: talanton]), balance, scales, and then inclination of
balance.'--Trench, Select Glossary, s.v. _Talent_.

1773. 'Audentes Forsque deusque iuuant.' We say, 'Fortune favours the
bold.' Cf. 'Audentes fortuna iuuat'; Verg. Æn. x. 284; 'Audentes deus ipse
iuuat'; Ovid, Met. x. 586.

1774. 'Whatever the event may be, my resolve is taken.' Audebimus ultima,
dixit'; l. 781.

1775. _Girt_, girdeth; pr. t. So _rit_, rideth, in l. 1776.

1780. _Halke_, corner, hiding-place; as in Sec. Non. Ta. G 311.

1781. _Gan he stalke_, he moved stealthily; as in Clerk. Ta. E 525. It is
remarkable that Shakespeare uses the same word in his Lucrece, l.
365:--'Into the chamber wickedly he _stalks_.' Prof. Corson notices its use
by Gower; see Pauli's edition, vol. i. pp. 72, 187; ii. 256, 346, 347, 353,
360.

1798. 'Parua sub infesto quum iacet agna lupo'; l. 800.

1800-3. Cf. Fast. ii. 801, 2:--

 'Quid faciat? Pugnet? uincetur femina pugna;
    Clamet? at in dextra, qui uetet, ensis erat.'

1812-26. These lines are original, and breathe the spirit of chivalry.

1827-36. Eight lines in Ovid; 815, 816; 813, 814; 817-20.

1838-46. This passage is original.

1847-53. Compare Ovid, 829, 830. But Chaucer here follows Livy, who has:
'Dant ordine omnes fidem; consolantur aegram animi, auertendo noxam ab
coacta in auctorem delicti; mentem peccare, non corpus; et unde consilium
afuerit, culpam abesse.' Cf. Gower, C. A. iii. 261.

1856-60. Two lines in Ovid; 833, 834:--

 'Tunc quoque, iam moriens, ne non procumbat honeste,
    respicit. Haec etiam cura cadentis erat.'

1861. Chaucer here tells the tale more succinctly. Ll. 1864-5 answer to ll.
849, 850 in Ovid; l. 1866 answers to l. 847 and l. 1869 to l. 852. The rest
is, practically, all Chaucer's own.

1871. This canonisation of Lucretia is strikingly medieval. It was
evidently suggested by the fact that Ovid gives her story under a
particular date, so that she seemed to have _her own day_, like a saint.
Cf. note to l. 1680.

1880. Probably the syllables _That in Is-_ form the first foot of the line.
Otherwise, _Israel_ is dissyllabic.

1881. The reference must be to the Syro-phenician woman; Matt. xv. 28;
Mark, vii. 29. But it may be feared that Chaucer was really thinking of the
centurion; Matt. viii. 10; Luke, vii. 9. Read _he ne_ as _he n'_.

1883, 4. _As of_, in the case of. _Alday_, always; F. _toujours_. 'Let
whoever wishes (it) test them.'


VI. THE LEGEND OF ARIADNE.

For a remark upon the title, see note to l. 1966.

It is difficult to say whence Chaucer derived all of this Legend. The
beginning is from Ovid, Metam. vii. 456-8, viii. 6-176; the main part of
the story is like Plutarch's Life of Theseus, or some similar source; and
the conclusion from Ovid's Heroides, epist. x. Further, ll. 2222-4 refer to
Met. viii. 176-182. See also Hyginus, Fabulae, capp. xli-xliii; Æneid, vi.
20-30; and cf. Gower, C. A. ii. 302-311.

1886. 'O Minos, king of Crete, judge in the infernal regions, now comes thy
lot, now comest thou into the ring (concourse).' In l. 1894 we again have
mention of Minos, king of Crete; which looks as if Chaucer has confused the
two kings of this name. The 'infernal judge' was, however, the grandfather
of the second Minos; at least, such is the usual account. The mention of
'the lot' in connection with Minos looks as if Chaucer was thinking of
Vergil's lines, Æn. vi. 431, 2:--

 'Nec uero hae _sine sorte_ datae, sine iudice sedes.
  Quaesitor Minos _urnam mouet_.'

Cf. also Æn. vi. 22:--'stat ductis sortibus urna.'

1889. _Memóri-e_ has four syllables, and is accented on the second.

1895. _Hadde_, had, possessed; referring to Crete. This seems better than
the reading _wan_ (i.e. won), referring to Minos. Cf. Ovid, Her. x.
67:--'Non ego te, Crete, centum digesta per urbes.'

1896. Cf. Ovid, Met. vii. 456-8:--

 'Bella parat Minos ...
  Androgeique necem iustis ulciscitur armis.'

Androgeus is again mentioned in Ovid, Her. x. 99; and in Vergil, Æn. vi.
20.

'There came certain of king Minos' ambassadors out of Creta, to ask a
tribute, being now the third time that it was demanded; which the Athenians
paid for this cause. Androgeus, the eldest son of king Minos, was slain by
treason within the country of Attica: for which cause Minos, pursuing the
revenge of his death, made very hot and sharp wars upon the Athenians, and
did them great hurt.'--Shakespeare's Plutarch, p. 280.

1900. From this point to l. 1921 Chaucer follows Ovid, Met. viii. 6-176,
but gives a mere outline of the story of Scylla. See note to l. 1908.

1902. _Alcathoe_, the citadel of Megara, and hence a name for Megara. It
was named after Alcathous, founder of Megara; indeed, in Ovid, Met. viii.
8, it is called _Alcathoi urbs_; but Chaucer found the right form in Met.
vii. 443.

1904. _Nisus_, Nisus, king of Megara; Met. viii. 8.

1908. Nisus' daughter was named Scylla. In order to gain the love of Minos,
she cut off her father's purple hair, on which the safety of his kingdom
depended; whereupon Nisus was changed into a sparrow-hawk, and Scylla into
the bird _ciris_; Met. viii. 9-151. But Chaucer omits these details. Cf.
Parl. of Foules, 292, and the note.

1922. Chaucer here leaves Ovid; this part of the story is partly given in
Plutarch and Hyginus, but Chaucer seems to have filled in details from some
source unknown to me.

1925. 'Whereupon the Athenians sent immediately unto him, and intreated him
for peace: which he granted them, with condition that they should be bound
to send him yearly, into Creta, seven young boys and as many young girls.
Now thus far all the historiographers do very well agree, but in the rest
not. And they which seem furthest off from the troth [including Chaucer] do
declare, that when these young boys were delivered in Creta, they caused
them to be devoured by the Minotaur within the labyrinth.'--Shakespeare's
Plutarch, p. 280.

1928. The Minotaur was a monster, half bull and half man, dwelling in a
labyrinth at Crete, constructed by Dædalus. He annually devoured the
fourteen Athenian young people, as above said, till slain by Theseus. Cf.
Ovid, Met. viii. 155.

1932. _Every thridde yeer_, every third year. This is due to Ovid's
expression--'tertia sors annis domuit repetita nouenis' (Met. viii. 171),
which Golding translates by--'The third time at the ninth yeares end the
lot did chance to light On Theseus,' &c. But Hyginus (Fab. xli)
says:--'Instituit autem ut anno unoquoque septenos liberos suos Minotauro
ad epulandum mitterent.'

1944. _Egeus_, Ægeus, king of Athens; Met. vii. 402, 404.

1954. 'That thou wouldst be deeply indebted to any one who,' &c.

1960. 'Furthermore, after he [Theseus] was arrived in Creta, he slew there
the Minotaur ... by the means and help of Ariadne: who being fallen in
fancy with him, did give him a clue of thread, by the help wherof she
taught him, how he might easily wind out of the turnings and crancks of the
labyrinth.'--Shak. Plutarch, p. 283. Cf. Ovid, Met. viii. 172; Hyginus,
Fab. xlii.

1962. _Foreyne_, outer chamber; belonging to the _chambres grete_, or set
of larger rooms occupied by the daughters of the king. It seems to answer
to the A.S. _búr_, mod. E. _bower_, explained in Murray's Dict. as 'an
inner apartment, esp. as distinguished from the "hall," or large public
room; _also_, esp. applied to a lady's private apartment; boudoir.' It is
merely a peculiar use of our word _foreign_; the O. Fr. _forain_ (fem.
_foraine_) often meant 'outer,' as in the phrases _une foraine rue_, an
outer (more retired) street; _es tenebres forennes_, into outer darkness;
see Godefroy's F. Dict. I agree with Mätzner, that there is no sufficient
reason for explaining the word in this passage by 'privy,' though it
admittedly has that meaning also (as given in Levins).

1965. _Maister-strete_, principal street; as in Kn. Ta., A 2902.

1966. Most MSS. begin the line with _Of Athenes_, as in l. 2306. This would
be a most extraordinary oversight, as the scene is laid in Crete, in the
town of Gnossus. MS. T. substitutes 'In mochell myrthe'; and the old
printed editions have 'Of the towne,' which scans badly, though 'Of thilke
toune' would do well enough. We seem justified in rejecting the reading _Of
Athenes_, because Chaucer distinctly mentions _Athenes_ in ll. 1940, 1944,
as being the place whence Theseus was sent 'unto the court of Minos'; l.
1949. Besides this, in l. 2122 Theseus calls Ariadne by the prospective
title of 'duchess of Athens'; on which Ariadne playfully remarks that she
and her sister are now 'assured to royal positions in Athens'; l. 2128.
From all which it does not seem fair to charge the error upon Chaucer
himself; and I therefore make the bold alteration suggested by MS. T., and
supported by MS. Addit. 9832, which has 'In moche myrth.' In the title of
the poem, Ariadne is called 'Adriane de Athenes,' but this is another
matter, and has reference to l. 2122. She became 'duchess of Athens' in the
right of her husband Theseus.

1969. _Adrian_ or _Adriane_, the M.E. spellings of Ariadne: see Ho. Fame,
407; Prol. to Man of Law, B 67. Ariadne and Phædra were the daughters of
Minos; Theseus took both of them away from Crete; and, on the voyage,
deserted Ariadne for her sister.

1990. 'And make this sorrowful man come with him.'

1992. _Quit_, free, delivered. It seems to have been an understood thing,
that if a captive Athenian should succeed in slaying the Minotaur, he
should go free, and the tribute paid by the Athenians should be remitted.
One account in Plutarch says that Minos himself 'chose Theseus, upon
condition agreed between them; ... and that after the death of the Minotaur
this tribute should cease.'--Sh. Plut. p. 282. One condition was, that the
captives should be _unarmed_. This explains Phædra's plan, in l. 1994, for
arming Theseus surreptitiously; cf. l. 2011.

1993. _Taste_, test. The word _test_ was formerly used only as a sb., of a
vessel in which gold or silver was tested; the place of the mod. E. verb to
test was supplied by the M.E. _tasten_, and there can be little doubt that
the words _taste_ and _test_ have been partially confused; see these words
in my Etym. Dict., whence I quote the following: 'The M.E. _tasten_ meant
both to feel and to taste. "I rede thee, lat thyn _hand_ upon it falle, And
_taste_ it wel, and stoon thou shalt it finde"; Ch. C. T. 15970 (G 502).
"Every thyng Himseolf schewith in _tastyng_;" King Alisaunder, 4042.--F.
_taster_, to taste or take an assay of; also to handle, feel, touch;
Cotgrave. Cf. mod. F. _tâter_; Ital. _tastare_, "to taste, to assaie, to
feele, to grope, to trye, to proofe, to touch"; Florio.'

1996. The former syllable of _Fighten_ forms a foot by itself.

1997. 'Where he will have to descend.'

2002. _Shal do_, will be sure to do.

2004. Bell remarks that this resembles the stratagem by which Daniel
destroyed the dragon at Babylon. 'Tulit igitur Daniel picem, et adipem, et
pilos, et coxit pariter: fecitque massas, et dedit in os draconis, et
diruptus est draco'; Dan. xiv. 26 (Vulgate).

2009. _To-hepe_, together; i.e. 'before they come to closer quarters.' Bell
alters this, the reading of all the MSS. and old editions, to _to kepe_,
which gives no sense; and Morris and Corson follow suit. Yet _to-hepe_,
lit. 'to a heap,' but used adverbially in the precise sense of 'together,'
is not a recondite expression. Morris explains it rightly elsewhere, viz.
in Chaucer's tr. of Boethius, bk. iv. pr. 6, l. 182, where 'y-medled
to-hepe' means 'mixed together.' It is also in Troil. iii. 1764:--'that
Love halt now _to-hepe_,' which Love now holds together. And yet again, in
Ch. Astrolabe, pt. i. § 14. 5. See also P. Plowm. Crede, 727.

2012. _The hous_, i.e. the famous labyrinth. _Crinkled_, full of turns or
'cranks'; see note to l. 1960. Cf. Mid. Du. _krunckel-winckel_, or
_krinckel-winckel_, 'crooked here and there'; Hexham (A.D. 1658); Du.
_krinkel_, a winding, _krinkelen_ or _kronkelen_, to wind about; all allied
to E. _crank_, a twist, hence a twisted handle. Cf. Ovid, Met. viii. 173;
Æn. vi. 27. And see Trevisa, tr. of Higden, i. 9.

2020. Read _drede_, dread; not _stede_, place. The Rime-indexes shew that,
in the ending _-ede_ in Chaucer, the former _e_ is usually long (_-[=e]de_,
_-eede_). However, _st[)e]de_, in the sense of 'stead' (A.S. _st[)e]de_),
rimes once with _dr[=e]de_, in Ho. Fame, 829.

2028. _Sit on his knee_, kneels down. We also find _to setten him on
knees_, _to fallen on knees_, _to knelen on knees_, _he lay on kne_, &c.
See Mätzner, s.v. _cneo_, p. 442. 'On knes she sat adoun'; Lay le Freine,
159. Cf. Man of Lawes Tale, B 638.

2029. _The righte_; here used as a vocative case.

2037. Cf. Arcite's service as a page; Kn. Ta., A 1427.

2040. _Nat but_, only, merely; the familiar Northern E. _nob-but_. See l.
2091.

2041. _Swinke_, toil, labour hard. It is curious that this word should be
obsolete. Perhaps no word that is now obsolete was once more common. It
occurs in Chaucer, Langland, Gower, Spenser, &c.; but not in Shakespeare.

2044. 'Nor any one else, shall be able to espy me.'

2048. 'In order to have my life, and to retain your presence.' The sense is
quite clear. The note in Corson--'_presence_ seems to mean here
presentiment or suspicion'--is due to some mistake.

2051. Only MS. C. retains _now_; and it would be better before _is_ than
after it.

2056. _Yif_, if; answering to _than_, then, in l. 2059.

2063. 'I pray Mars to do me such a favour.'

2064. _Shames deeth_, a death of shame; see l. 2072.

2065. _Póvert_ occurs as a dissyllable, in Cant. Ta., C 441.

2066. Pronounce _spirit_ nearly as _spir't_.

_Go_, walk about, roam. He prays that he may be punished by being made to
walk as a ghost after death. A reference to the supposed restlessness of
the spirits of wicked men; see Parl. of Foules, 80. But good spirits also
'walked' sometimes; Wint. Tale, iii. 3. 17.

2069. _For which_, for which cause, on which account. _Go_, may walk; the
subjunctive mood.

2070. _Other degree_, i.e. a higher degree than that of page. He professes
not to aspire to this, _unless_ she vouchsafes to give it him.

2072. 'May I die by a death of shame.' The _of_ depends on _deye_; cf. Man
of Lawes Tale, B 819.

2075. _A twenty_, about twenty. _A_ is here used as expressly an
approximative result; as in '_an_ eight days,' Luke ix. 28; so '_a_ ten,'
Squi. Tale, F 383. Only MS. C. retains _a_, but it is wanted for the metre.

2082. _God shilde hit_, God defend or forbid it.

2083. _Leve_, grant. We also find _lene_, to grant, give, but it is only
used with a following _case_; whilst _leve_ is only used with a following
_clause_. _Me_ is governed by _befalle_. 'And grant that such a case may
never befall me,' i.e. for Theseus to be merely her page.

2086. _And leve_, and may He also grant.

2089. 'Yet it would be better'; followed by _Then_ (= than) in l. 2092.

2094. The latter syllable of _profit_ comes at the caesura, and is easily
read quickly. We need not change _unto_ into _to_, as in MS. A. only.

2096. _To my_, as for my.

2099. _That_, (I propose) that. _Sone_, Hippolytus. Yet, in l. 2075,
Theseus was only 23 years old! Perhaps she proposes, in banter, a purely
whimsical condition; cf. ll. 2102, 2120, 2127.

2100. _Hoom-coming_, arrival at home; cf. Kn. Tale, 26 (A 884).

2101. _Fynal ende_, definite settlement.

2105. _To borwe_, as a pledge; cf. Squi. Ta., F 596.

2107. To draw blood on oneself was a frequent mode of attestation. Cf.
Wright's note on K. Lear, ii. I. 34; and note how Faustus stabs his arm in
Marlowe's play; Act ii. sc. 1.

2120. _Servant_, devoted lover; the usual phrase. This asseveration of
Theseus shews that he thought Ariadne immeasurably credulous.

2122. _Of Athenes duchesse_, (whom I hail as) duchess of Athens. That is,
he promises her marriage. In l. 2127 Ariadne grows pleasant on the subject.

2128. 'And assured to the royalties (or regal attributes) of Athens'; i.e.
we are secure of our future royal rank.

2130. _And saved_, and we have saved. Chaucer has _be_ just above; so that
he has changed the idiom.

2132. _Emforth hir might_, even-forth with her might, to the extent of her
power; cf. Kn. Ta., 1377 (A 2235).

2134. 'It seems to me, no one ought to blame us for this; nor give us an
evil name on this account.'

2145. _Geeth_, goeth, goes; A.S. _g['æ]ð_. For two more examples, see _geð_
in Gloss. to Spec. of English, Part I.

2150. _By_, by help of, with the help of.

2151. _Of_, with. _Gan hit charge_, did load it. 'And they say, that having
killed this Minotaur, he returned back again the same way he went, bringing
with him those other young children of Athens [whom Chaucer forgets to
mention], whom with Ariadne also he carried afterwards away.'--Sh.
Plutarch, p. 283.

2155. _Ennopye_, Oenopia, another name for Ægina; which was on their way
from Crete to Athens. Chaucer got the name from Ovid, Met. vii. 472, 473,
490; and introduces it naturally enough, because Æacus, then dwelling
there, was an old ally of the Athenians; id. 485; cf. l. 2156 in our poem.
Gilman suggests that Enope (i.e. Gerenia in Messenia) is meant, which is
merely a wild guess.

2161. _Woon_, number. Originally, a hope; also, a resource, a store, a
quantity; and hence _gret woon_ = a great number. For examples, see
_w[=a]n_ in Stratmann; and cf. note to Troil. iv. 1181.

2163. _Yle_, island; usually said to be Naxos, on the supposition that it
is not much out of the way in sailing from Gnossus in Crete to Attica.
Chaucer has inadvertently brought Theseus to Ægina already; but we need not
trouble about the geographical conditions. The description of the island is
from Ovid, Her. x. 59:--'Uacat insula cultu'; &c.

2167. _Lette_, tarried; pt. t. of the weak verb _letten_; quite distinct
from _leet_ or _l[=e]t_ (pt. t. of _leten_), which would not rime with
_set-te_. This latter part of the story is nearly all from Ovid, Her. x.

Compare, e.g. ll. 4-6:--

   'unde tuam sine me uela tulere ratem;
  In quo me somnusque meus male prodidit, et tu,
     pro facinus! somnis insidiate meis.'

2176. _To his contre-ward_, i.e. toward his country. Cf. 'To Thebes-ward';
Kn. Ta. 109 (A 967).

2177. _A twenty devil way_, in the way of twenty devils; i.e. in all sorts
of evil ways or directions; cf. Can. Yem. Ta., G 782.

2178. _His fader_, king Ægeus (l. 1944). The story is that Theseus went to
Crete in a ship with a black sail, in token of his unhappy fate. He had
agreed to exchange this for a white sail, if his expedition was successful;
but this he omitted to do. Hence Ægeus, 'seeing the black sail afar off,
being out of all hope ever more to see his son again, took such a grief at
his heart, that he threw himself headlong from the top of a cliff, and
killed himself.'--Shak. Plutarch, p. 284.

2182. _Atake_, overtaken with sleep; cf. C. T. 6966 (D 1384).

2186. 'Perque torum moueo brachia; nullus erat'; Her. x. 12.

2189, 90.

   'Alta puellares tardat arena pedes.
  Interea toto clamanti littore, Theseu!' id. 20.

2192. Suggested by Ovid; ll. 81-6.

2193. 'Reddebant nomen concaua saxa tuum'; id. 22. The Latin and English
lines are alike beautiful.

2194. 'Luna fuit; specto, si quid, nisi littora, cernam'; id. 17.

2195-7. These three lines represent eight in Ovid; 25-32.

2198. This line answers to the first line in Ovid, Epist. x.

2200, 1. _His meiny_, its (complete) crew. _Inne_, within; A.S. _innan_.

 'Quo fugis, exclamo, scelerate? Reuertere, Theseu;
    flecte ratem; numerum non habet illa suum'; id. 35.

2202.

 'Candidaque imposui longae uelamina uirgae,
    scilicet oblitos admonitura mei'; id. 41.

2208-17. Paraphrased from Ovid; Her. x. 51-64.

2212. _Answere of_, answer for; 'redde duos.'

2214. _Wher shal I become?_ Where shall I go to? the old idiom. We now say,
'what will become of me?' On this expression, see _Bicome_ in my Gloss. to
P. Plowman (Clar. Press Series).

2215. 'For even if a ship or boat were to come this way, I dare not go home
to my country, for fear (of my father).'

The reading _that bote none here come_ is nonsense, and expresses the
converse of what is meant. The corresponding line in Ovid is--'Finge dari
comitesque mihi, uentosque, ratemque'; 63.

2218. _What_, for what, why? See Cant. Ta., B 56, &c.

2220. _Naso_, Ouidius Naso. _Her epistle_, the epistle above quoted, the
title of which is--'Ariadne Theseo.'

2223, 4. The story is that Bacchus took compassion on Ariadne, and finally
placed her crown as a constellation in the heavens; see Ovid, Fasti, iii.
461-516; Met. viii. 178-182. This constellation is the Northern Crown, or
Corona Borealis, which is just in the opposite side of the sky from Taurus.
Ovid says--'qui medius nixique genu est anguemque tenentis,' Met. viii.
182. Here the holder of the snake is Ophiuchus; and _Nixus genu_ or
_Engonasin_ ([Greek: en gonasin]) was a name for Hercules; see Hyginus,
Poet. Ast. lib. ii. c. 6; lib. iii. c. 5; Ausonius, Eclog. iii. 2. The
Northern Crown comes to the meridian with the sign Scorpio, not Taurus. We
can only bring the sense right by supposing that _in the signe of Taurus_
means when the _sun_ is in that sign, viz. in April. In the nights of
April, in our latitude, the Northern Crown is very conspicuous.

2227. _Quyte him his whyle_, repay him for his time, i.e. for the way in
which he had spent his time; cf. Man of Law's Ta., B 584.


VII. THE LEGEND OF PHILOMELA.

Chaucer's Prologue ends at l. 2243. The tale is from Ovid, Met. vi.
424-605, with some omissions, and ends at l. 2382. Gower has the same
story; C. A. bk. v. ed. Pauli, ii. 313.

2228. The words 'Deus dator formar_um_' are written after the title in MS.
B.; and part of the first line corresponds to this expression. In MS. F. it
appears as 'Deus dator formator_um_[71],' which can hardly be right.

Corson has the following note:--'In these verses (2228-30) the Platonic
doctrine of forms or ideas is expressed. For whatever knowledge Chaucer may
have had of the philosophy of Plato, he was probably indebted to the
Italian poets, with whom, especially Petrarch, Plato was a favourite.'
Corson also quotes the following from Sir Wm. Hamilton:--'Plato agreed with
the rest of the ancient philosophers in this--that all things consist of
matter and form; and that matter of which all things were made, existed
from eternity, without form; but he likewise believed that there are
external _forms_ of all possible things which exist, without matter; and to
these eternal and immaterial forms he gave the name of ideas. In the
Platonic sense, then, ideas were the patterns to which the Deity fashioned
the phenomenal or ectypal world.' See also Spenser, Hymne in honour of
Beautie, st. 5. And cf. l. 1582 above.

However, Chaucer here follows Boethius, De Consolatione Philosophiae, lib.
iii. met. 9:--

                      ... 'Tu cuncta superno
  ducis ab exemplo, pulcrum pulcerrimus ipse
  mundum mente gerens, similique in imagine formans.'

See Chaucer's version of the same, ll. 1-12. Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose,
16931-8, also copied from Boethius, who follows Plato.

2233. _As for that fyn_, with that particular object.

2236. _Fro this world_, i.e. from the centre of the universe; according to
the old Ptolemaic system which made the earth the fixed centre of all
things. _The firste hevene_, the first or outermost sphere, that of Saturn;
see note to Complaint of Mars, 29.

2237. Understand _al_ (everything) as the nom. case to _corrumpeth_; i.e.
everything becomes corrupt, is infected.

2238. _As to me_, as for me, in my opinion.

2241. _Yit last_, still lasts, still endures.

2243. Read--The stóry of Térë-ús, &c.; the _-y_ in _story_ being rapidly
slurred over.

2244. Here begins Ovid, Met. vi. 424:--'Threïcius Tereus.' Tereus was king
of Thrace; and Ovid says he could trace his descent from Gradivus, i.e.
Mars (l. 427).

_Marte_, Mars. Corson here notes that '_Marte_ is the ablative case of
Mars, as _Jove_ is of Jupiter.' It is worth while to say that this view is
quite erroneous; for these forms did not arise in that way. _Marte_ was
formed from _Martem_, the accusative case, by dropping the final _m_; and,
generally, the Romance languages formed most of their substantives from
_accusative_ cases, owing to the frequent use of that case, especially in
the construction of the accus. with the infinitive, which in medieval Latin
was very common. See Sir G. Cornewall Lewis' Essay on the Romance
Languages, and Diez, Grammatik der Romanischen Sprachen, vol. ii. Thus the
F. _corps_ represents the Lat. acc. _corpus_, not the abl. _corpore_; as is
sufficiently obvious.

2247. Read--_Pán-di-ón-es_. Pandion, a king of Athens, was father of Progne
and Philomela. Cf. The Passionate Pilgrim, xxi. 395.

2249. The original Latin should be consulted, as Chaucer sometimes copies
Ovid literally, and sometimes goes his own way.

               'Non pronuba Iuno,
  non Hymenaeus adest illi, non Gratia lecto.
  Eumenides tenuere faces de funere raptas:
  Eumenides strauere torum: tectoque profanus
  incubuit bubo, thalamique in culmine sedit.'--428.

2253. _Wond_, wound; _aboute the balkes wond_, kept winding (flying in
circular wise) round about the balks (or transverse beams beneath the
roof). Three good MSS. read _wond_, which is the past tense of _winden_, to
wind. Bell and others read _wonde_, explained by 'dwelt'; but this is open
to two objections, viz. (1) the pt. t. of _wonien_ to dwell, is _woned_ or
_wonede_, not _wonde_; and (2) an owl cannot dwell _about_ a balk, but only
_on_ it. The pt. pl. _woneden_ (three syllables) occurs in the Kn. Ta. 2069
(A 2927); and we learn from the Clerkes Tale, E 339, that the pp. _woned_
rimes with _astoned_. Ovid, indeed, has _incubuit_ and _sedit_; but that
does not prove much; for Chaucer expresses things in his own manner at
will.

2256. This original line refers to the medieval wedding-feasts, which
sometimes lasted even forty days. See Havelok, l. 2344; and the note.

2259-68. From Ovid, Met. vi. 438-442.

2261. _Saw not longe_, had not seen for a long time.

2264. _Moste_, might. _Ones_, for once; lit. once.

2265. _And come anoon_, and return again soon.

2266. 'Or else, unless she might go to see her.'

2270. 'Caused his ships to be made ready.'

2270-8. From Ovid, Met. vi. 444-450. Chaucer next passes on to ll. 475,
483. Ll. 2288-2294 are abridged from ll. 451-471 of the Latin. Ll.
2295-2301 answer to ll. 495-501; ll. 2302-2307 to ll. 488, 489; but many
touches are Chaucer's own, and he is seldom literal.

2282. Read _lovede_ as _lov'de_; cf. _preyde_, 2294. This line is imitated
in Kn. Ta. 338 (A 1196)--'For in this world he lovede no man so.'

2290, 1. 'And that there was none like her in (royal) array'; Met. vi. 451.
_Two so riche_, twice as rich; cf. _ten so wood_, in l. 736.

2308. Cf. Ovid, Met. vi. 512.

2312, 3. 'If it might please her, or (even) if it might not please her.'

2318-22. Ovid has these images of the lamb (l. 527) and of the dove (529).

2335. This 'castle' answers to Ovid's 'custodia' (572).

2340. 'God avenge thee, and grant thee thy petition (for vengeance).'

2342-9. Cf. Ovid, Met. vi. 563-570.

2352. _Stole_, stool, frame for tapestry work. Hexham's Du. Dict. (1658)
gives: '_Stoel-doeck_, Tapistrie, or Hangings'; lit. stool-cloth. Cf. G.
_Weberstuhl_, a loom; lit. weaver-stool. _Radevore_, a kind of serge; here,
the material on which tapestry-work was executed. The only other example I
have met with is in a poem beginning--'As ofte as syghes ben in herte
trewe,' in the Tanner MS. 346, fol. 73. One stanza begins thus:--

 'As ofte tymes as Penelapye
  Renewed her werk in the _raduore_,
  To saue her-selfe onely in honeste
  Vnto Vlixes, that she louyd so sore.'

(Another copy of these lines is in MS. Ff. 1. 6 in the Cambridge Univ.
Library, fol. 11.)

Here _raduore_ is clearly an error for _radeuore_ or _radevore_, as the
scansion shews. Urry's Glossary gives the following explanation: '_Ras_ in
French means any stuff [it means serge or satin], as _Ras de Chalons_, _Ras
de Gennes_; _Ras de Vore_ or _Vaur_ may be a stuff made at such a place.'
On which Tyrwhitt remarks--'There is a town in Languedoc called _La Vaur_;
but I know not that it was ever famous for tapestry.' Cotgrave gives:
'_Ras_, serge'; also '_Ras de Milain_, the finest kind of bare serge, or a
silke serge.' Littré cites _ras de Châlons_ from Scarron, Virg. iv.; also
'bas de soye, _raz de Millan_ et d'estame.' _Ras_, in fact, is the same as
the Tudor-English word _rash_. The loss of the _s_ in _ras de Vore_ is
regular, because _s_ drops before _d_ in Anglo-French, though it is
preserved in _ras_ when used alone. I find, on consulting the English
Cyclopædia, that _La Vaur_, in the department of Tarn, produces silk and
serge to this day; so that Urry is certainly right. The whole account in
ll. 2350-72 is expanded from five lines in the Latin text, 576-580:--

 'Stamina barbarica suspendit candida tela:
  purpureasque notas filis intexuit albis'; &c.

Observe that, in l. 2360, the stuff is called 'a _stamin_.'

2359. _By that_, by the time that.

2360. _A stamin large_, a large piece of stamine. _Stamin_ or _stamine_ is
usually explained as a kind of woollen cloth. Cotgrave gives: '_Estamine_,
the stuffe tamine.' Godefroy gives both _estamin_, masc. and _estamine_,
fem. explained by 'tissu léger de laine ou de coton.' Palsgrave
has:--'Stamell, fyne worstede, _estamine_'; and--'Stamyne, _estamine_.' The
Prompt. Parv. has:--'Stamyn, clothe, _stamina_.' _Stamin_ was used as a
material for shirts, and was worn by way of penance; Fosbrooke explains it
as 'a shirt made of woollen and linen, used instead of a penitentiary
hair-shirt.' '_Stamin_ habbe whoso wule,' whoso will may have a stamin;
Ancren Riwle, p. 418. Chaucer uses it thus near the end of the Persones
Tale (I 1052); 'Also in weringe of heyres or of _stamin_ or of haubergeons
on hir naked flesh for Cristes sake, and swiche manere penances.'

MSS. C. T. A. have _stamyn_, which seems the better form; the rest (like
the printed editions) have _stames_, which may be an error for _stamel_,
O.F. _estamel_, used in the same sense as O.F. _estamine_. Else it may
answer to O.F. _estame_, 'laine peignée, tricot de laine' in Godefroy. The
fact that Ovid's word is _stamina_ is in favour of the spelling _stamin_.
(Bell remarks that 'the printed copies read _flames_, which is nonsense.'
He seems to have misread _stames_ (with long _s_) as _flames_. The editions
of 1532, 1550, and 1561 certainly have _stames_.)

2373-82. Abridged from Met. vi. 581-605. Ovid mentions the triennial
festival to Bacchus.

2379. _Compleint_ is a much better reading than the _constreynte_ of the
old editions.

2383. _No charge_, of no consequence; Squi. Ta., F 359.

2383-93. All Chaucer's own. The last line is characteristic: 'unless it
happens to be the case that he cannot get another,' i.e. a new love. For
_non other_, old editions have _another_!

2385. Here _deserved_ is the usual Chaucerian form of the pt. tense. Prof.
Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, i. 403) calls this a false form. But cf.
_wyped_, _lipsed_ (in _-ed_, not _-ede_); Prol. to C. T., 133, 264.


VIII. THE LEGEND OF PHYLLIS.

Gower tells the same story in his Confessio Amantis, bk. iv. (ed. Pauli,
ii. 26); and it is likely that he and Chaucer derived it from the same
source, whatever that may have been. A portion of the latter part, from l.
2496, is taken from Ovid, Heroides, Ep. ii. And see note to l. 2423.

2395. An allusion to Matt. vii. 16, and to Legend VI, above.

2398. _Demophon_, usually Demophoön, son of Theseus and Phædra, who, on his
return from Troy, gained the love of Phyllis, daughter of Sithon, king of
Thrace. Observe that Gower says that Demophoön was on his way _towards_
Troy.

2400. 'Unless it were.'

2401. Observe that _grac-e_ is dissyllabic, as in l. 2433.

2403. 'Now I turn to the effect (the pith) of what I have to say.'

2413. _Him_ seems to stand alone in the first foot; for _were_, in this
phrase, is usually monosyllabic; cf. Mancip. Prol., H 23. But it also
occurs as a dissyllable, in which case the line is normal. Or else the
_-er_ in _lever_ is dwelt on.

2416. 'And his rudder was broken by a wave.'

2420. _For wood_, as (if) mad, 'like mad.' _For_ is not a prefix, but a
separate word; as shewn by 'for pure wood,' Rom. Rose, 276; and see Ho.
Fame, 1747. _Posseth_, pusheth, tosseth. Bech observes that ll. 2411-21 are
from Vergil, Æn. i. 85-90, 102, 142.

2422. _Chorus_; so in Thynne's edition; the MSS. have _Thorus_ (except T.,
which has _Thora_). Both _Chorus_ and _Thorus_ are unknown as
sea-divinities; but I think I can guess Chaucer's authority, viz. Verg. Æn.
v. 823-5:--

 'Et senior Glauci _chorus_, Inousque Palaemon,
  _Tritones_que citi, Phoreique _exercitus omnis_.
  Laeua tenent _Thetis_ et Melite, Panopeaque uirgo.'

Here we find _Thetis_, _chorus_, _Triton_; whilst 'and they alle' answers
to _exercitus omnis_. (So also Bech.) _Chorus_ is used for Caurus, the
north-east wind, in Chaucer's Boethius, bk. iv. met. 5. 17; but this is not
the purpose.

2423. _Lond_, i.e. Thrace. Phyllis, as said above, was the daughter of
Sithon, king of Thrace; but both Chaucer and Gower make her father's name
to be 'Ligurgus,' i.e. Lycurgus. This substitution may have been suggested
by Ovid, Her. ii. 111--'quae tibi subieci latissima regna _Lycurgi_.' He is
the same as the Lycurgus in Statius, Theb. iv. 386; in Ovid, Met. iv. 22,
and in Homer, vi. 130; and was king of the Edoni, a people of _Thrace_.
This accounts also for the introduction into the Knight's Tale of 'Ligurge
himself, the grete king of Thrace'; l. 1271 (A 2129). Prof. Lounsbury
(Studies in Chaucer, ii. 232) has usefully pointed out that the immediate
authority for making Lycurgus the _father_ of Phyllis was Boccaccio's De
Genealogia Deorum, lib. xi. c. 25, headed--'De Phyllidi Lycurgi filia.'

2425. _On to sene_, to look upon; cf. the parallel line, Kn. Ta., 177 (A
1035).

2427. _Is y-wonne_, is arrived. Cf. Æn. i. 173.

2434. _Chevisaunce_, borrowing; properly an agreement for borrowing money.
See C. T. 13259, 13277, 13321 (B 1519, 1537, 1581); P. Plowman, B. 5. 249,
and the note; and the Gloss. to Spenser.

2438. _Rodopeya_, the country near Rhodope, which was a mountain-range of
Thrace, now a part of the Hæmus range. See l. 2498.

2448. 'As Reynard the fox doth, so (doth) the fox's son.' The line is
incomplete, but the sense is clear. 'Reynard, which with us is a duplicate
for fox, while in the French _renard_ has quite excluded the older
_volpils_, was originally not the name of a kind, but the proper name of
the fox-hero, the vulpine Ulysses, in that famous beast-epic of the middle
ages, _Reineke Fuchs_; the immense popularity of which we gather from many
evidences, from none more clearly than this. _Chanticleer_ is in like
manner the name of the cock, and _Bruin_ of the bear in the same
poem.'--Trench, Eng. Past and Present. _Reynard_ is from M.H.G.
_ragin-hart_, strong in counsel; from _ragin_, counsel, and _hart_, strong.

2454. _Agroted_, surfeited, cloyed. A rare word; used also by Lydgate. See
the New E. Dict.

2456. This is a hint that Chaucer was already getting tired of his task.

2477. _In a month._ So in Ovid; see l. 2503.

2485. _With a corde_, i.e. by hanging. Cf. Ovid, Her. ii. 141:--

 'Colla quoque, infidis quae se nectenda lacertis
    praebuerant, laqueis implicuisse libet.'

2493. _Hir soules_, their souls; of Theseus and Demophoön.

2495. 'Although it be but a small part of the whole letter.' In fact,
Chaucer gives us ll. 1-8 of Ovid's second Epistle (in the Heroides); and,
from l. 2518 onward, sentences made up from ll. 26, 27, 43, 44, 49-52,
63-68, 73-78, and 134-137 of the same.

2496. Compare these lines with Ovid, Her. ii. 1-8:--

 'Hospita, Demophoon, tua te Rhodopeïa Phyllis
    ultra promissum tempus abesse queror.
  Cornua quum Lunae pleno semel orbe coissent,
    litoribus nostris ancora pacta tua est.
  Luna quater latuit, toto quater orbe recrevit,
    nec uehit Actæas Sithonis unda rates.
  Tempora si numeres, bene quae numeramus amantes,
    non uenit ante suum nostra querela diem.'

_Hostess-e_ is trisyllabic; MS. C. has--'Ostess-e thyn.'

2502. _Highte_, promised. But Chaucer seems to have mistaken the sense of
Ovid's fourth line (in the note to l. 2496).

2508. 'Sithonis unda'; see note to l. 2496. Here _Sithonis_ is an adj.
(gen. _Sithonidis_), and means 'Sithonian,' i.e. Thracian; because Sithon
or Sitho, her father, was king of Thrace. I substitute _Sitho_ for the MS.
spellings.

2518. See note to l. 2495 for references.

2521. _For_, because: 'quid feci, nisi non sapienter amaui?'

2529. _May_ occupies the first foot of the line.

2534. She prays that the glory of having betrayed her will be the greatest
glory he will ever attain to. 'Di faciant, laudis summa sit ista tuae!'
(66).

2551. _Mote ye_, may ye. 'Ad tua me fluctus proiectam littora portent';
(135).

2556. _And knew_, i.e. and _she_ knew.

2558. Read--'Such sórw' hath shé,' &c. Bell altered the second _she_ in
this line to _he_, without authority, and unnecessarily. The word _besette_
does not mean 'served' or 'treated,' as those who keep this reading have to
assert, but 'bestowed' or 'gave up,' and _her_ means 'herself.' The sense
is therefore--'Such sorrow hath she, because she so disposed of herself.'
See _Beset_ in the New E. Dict. § 7. Caxton has: 'Orgarus thought his
doughter shol wel be maryed, and wel _beset_ upon hym'; Chron. Eng. cxii.

2561. _Trusteth_, imp. pl. _As in love_, in the matter of love. This
playful line is in the same spirit as l. 2393 above.


IX. THE LEGEND OF HYPERMNESTRA.

The story is told in Ovid, Her. xiv. But Chaucer has taken some of the
details from Boccaccio, De Genealogia Deorum, lib. ii. c. 22. Cf. Hyginus,
Fab. 168. See the Introduction.

2563. _Danao_, Danaus. Danaus and Ægyptus were twin brothers. Ægyptus had
50 sons, and Danaus 50 daughters. Danaus had reason to fear his nephews,
and fled with his daughters to Argos. Thither he was followed by the sons
of Ægyptus, who demanded his daughters in marriage, and promised faithful
alliance. Danaus distributed his daughters amongst them, but to each of
them gave a dagger, with which they were to kill their husbands on the
bridal night. They all did so, except Hypermnestra, who saved her husband
Lynceus. Thus the attempt of Danaus failed, and he was slain by Lynceus, in
accordance with the destiny predicted for him.

It must be particularly noted that Chaucer makes Ægyptus and Danaus change
places. According to him, Ægyptus was the father of the _daughters_, and
consequently attempted the life of Lynceus; whilst Danaus was the father of
the _sons_, and therefore of Lynceus.

2569. _Lino_; by which perverted name Lynceus is meant; Boccaccio has
'_Lino_ seu _Linceo_' (dat. case).

2570. _Egiste_ represents Boccaccio's Ægistus, i.e. Ægyptus.

2574. 'And caused (men) to call her,' i.e. had her named.

2575. _Ypermistra_, i.e. Hypermestra, a corrupter form of Hypermnestra; see
the account in the Introduction. Note that the first syllable _Y-_ forms
the first foot in the line.

2576. _Of her nativitee_, by her horoscope; see l. 2584.

2577. _Thewes_, qualities. Craik has a long note on this word in his
edition of Julius Cæsar. It merely comes to this, that _thew_ must have
meant strength or some excellent _bodily_ quality in the first instance,
and some excellent _mental_ quality afterwards. Nevertheless it is
remarkable that (with one exception in Layamon, 6361) the usual _old_ sense
is the latter; and the usual _modern_ sense (notably in Jul. Cæs. i. 3. 81,
2 Hen. IV. iii. 2. 276) is the former. The A.S. form is _þéaw_. Craik's
notion that this word was confused with A.S. _þéoh_, the thigh, is entirely
out of the question, and gives no help.

2580. _Wirdes_, Fates; Lat. Parcæ; Gk. Moiræ. Corson shews that G. Douglas
translates the Lat. _fata_ by _werdes_ in Æn. i. 18, and _Parcæ_ by _werd
sisteris_ in the same, iii. 379. He also quotes from Holinshed's Hist. of
Scotland--'the _weird sisters_, that is, as ye would say, the goddesses of
destinie'; reproduced by Shakespeare in Macb. iv. 1. 136.

2582. The scansion suggests that _Pitous-e_, _sad-de_, are treated like
French adjectives, the final _e_ denoting the feminine gender. This is
natural in the case of _pitous-e_, fem. of _pitous_, just as we have
_dispitous-e_, Book of the Duch. 624; but the distinction is not often made
in M.E. Sweet's A.S. grammar gives _til-u_ as an occasional fem. form of
the nom. of the indef. adjective; so that _sæd-u_ might have been used.
_Wys-e_ is likewise dissyllabic, though the A.S. form was _wís_ even in the
feminine. But the _definite_ forms of the M.E. adj. were _sad-de_, _wys-e_;
and there may have been consequent confusion. In fact, Prof. Child gives a
list of adjectives of this kind, being monosyllabic in A.S., but
dissyllabic in Chaucer. He includes _wise_, but not _sad_, his examples
being taken from the Canterbury Tales only, and thence only in clear cases.
_Dispitous-e_ occurs as a vocative case, in Troil. ii. 435.

2584. Here comes in the old belief in astrology. Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and
Saturn, as here mentioned, are not the gods, but the planets; and each
planet had (it was thought) its peculiar influence, which was stronger or
weaker according to its position in the heavens at the time of birth of the
person whom it affected. The influences of Venus and Jupiter were for good
(see note to Troil. iii. 1417); whilst the influences of Mars and Saturn
were evil. See further below.

2585. _With_ is explained by Corson to mean 'by'; and such a sense is, of
course, usual and common. For all that, it may here mean 'with.' The sense
seems to me to be--'For, though the influence of the planet Venus gave her
great beauty, she was (also) so compounded with a share of Jupiter,' &c. It
does not make much difference, and the reader can choose.

2588. _Thoughte her_, it seemed to her.

2589. _Rede Mars_, red Mars, because the planet is reddish; see note to l.
533. Cf. Kn. Ta., 1111 (A 1969). As to the bad influence of Mars, compare
the following:--

 'Allas! thou _felle_ Mars!' Kn. Ta. 701 (A 1559).
 'Noght was foryeten by the _infortune_ of Marte'; id. 1163 (A 2021).
 'By _manasyng_ of Mars'; id. 1177 (A 2035).
  ... 'that no _wykkid_ planete, as Saturne or Mars'
               Treatise on the Astrolabe, ii. 4. 22 (p. 192, above).

2592. Venus was supposed to have much influence in repressing the evil
influence of Mars, on account of their connection in mythology. See the
Compleint of Mars. Moreover Mars is here said to be suppressed by 'the
oppression of houses'; i.e. by the fact that he was in a 'house' or
'mansion,' which had such effect. The terms 'house' and 'mansion' are
equivalent, and are names given to the signs of the zodiac. Every sign had
a planet assigned to it, and was called the 'house' of that planet. When a
planet was in its own house, its influence would be felt. The mansions of
Mars were Aries and Scorpio. Besides this, each planet had a sign called
its 'exaltation,' in which it had the greatest power of all. The
'exaltation' of Mars was Capricornus. Mars had also his positions of least
influence; two of these, called his 'fall,' were the signs opposite to his
mansions, viz. Libra and Taurus, and the third, called his 'depression,'
was the sign opposite his exaltation, viz. Cancer. We may conclude that, at
the period of taking Hypermnestra's horoscope, Mars was in Cancer, or else
in Taurus or in Libra. Both Taurus and Libra were mansions of Venus; and,
if Mars was in either of these, his evil influence would be kept under by
her.

2594. Probably the whole of Chaucer's astrological talk was intended to
shew _why_ Hypermnestra disliked handling a knife in malice. He has made
much of the weak influence of Mars, precisely because those who were born
under his influence were very ready with a knife. See the note to the Kn.
Ta., 1163 (A 2021), where the Compost of Ptolemeus is quoted to shew that a
man born under Mars is apt to be 'a maker of swordes and knyves, and a
sheder of mannes blode, ... and good to be a barboure and a blode-letter,
and to draw tethe, and is peryllous of his handes.'

2597. 'She had too evil aspects of Saturn, which caused her to die in
prison.' All the MSS. have _To_ (= too, excessively), except T., which has
_Ryght bad_. Thynne has _Two_, but there is no authority for this, nor does
it give any sense. The evil influence of Saturn is spoken of at length in
the Kn. Tale, 1596-1611 (A 2454-69). Note especially l. 1599, where Saturn
says:--

 'Myn is the _prison_ in the derke cote,
  Myn is the strangling and hanging by the throte.'

2600. Here _Egiste_ (see l. 2570) is turned into _Egistes_.

2602. 'For, at that time, no lineage was spared'; i.e. no consanguinity was
considered as being a bar to marriage.

2603. _Hem_ is in apposition with _Danao_ and _Egistes_; 'it pleased these
two.'

2604. Note the shifted accentuation--Ypérmistrá. Chaucer (except in l.
2660) entirely drops all mention of Hypermnestra's 49 sisters, and of
Lynceus' 49 brothers. This is extremely judicious, as it concentrates the
interest on the heroine.

2610. Chaucer is here thinking of Ovid, Her. xiv. 25:--

 'Undique collucent praecinctae lampades auro.
    Dantur in inuitos impia tura focos.
  Uulgus "Hymen, Hymenaee" uocant.'

2624. 'He caused men to call his daughter'; he had his daughter called to
him.

2629. 'Ever since the day when my shirt was first shaped for me.' The sense
is--'ever since the day of my birth.' The _shirt_ here refers, as Tyrwhitt
remarks, to the linen in which a new-born babe is wrapped. See Kn. Ta., 708
(A 1566); and cf. Troil. iii. 733:--

 'O fatal sustren, which, er any cloth
  Me shapen was, my destenee me sponne.'

2630. Supply _I_ before _had_. Cf. note to l. 2580.

2634. _After thy wyser_, according to the advice of thy superior in
wisdom.' Cf. 'Thenne doth we as the wise'; O. English Miscellany, ed.
Morris, p. 79, l. 228. 'And gif yow list nocht wirk eftir the wise'; G.
Douglas, tr. of Vergil, Prol. to bk. vi. l. 15.

2637. Read _Ne I_ as _N'I_. 'Nor would I advise thee to thy harm.'

2640. 'And, at the same time, I make protestation in this manner, viz.
that, unless thou do as I shall direct thee.'

2653. 'I will not have any reservation.'

2655. _Y-sene_, visible; an adj., not a pp. See l. 1394; and Prol. to Cant.
Tales, 592.

2660. _Siker_, secure. The use of the word is precisely like that in the
well-known anecdote of Kirkpatrick of Closeburn. Meeting Bruce at the door
of the Greyfriars' Church in Dumfries, he asked what tidings. 'Bad
tidings,' answered Bruce, 'I doubt I have slain Comyn.' 'Doubtest thou?'
said Kirkpatrick; 'I make _sicker_.' With these words, he and Lindsay
rushed into the church and despatched the wounded Comyn. See Note K to
Scott's Lord of the Isles, c. 1. st. 27, c. 2. st. 13.

2661. _Biker_, quarrel, altercation; also a skirmish, encounter.

2662. 'By him that I have (already) sworn by.' See l. 2642.

2666. _Costrel_, a flask, a kind of bottle. '_Costred_, or _costrelle_,
grete botelle, _Onopherum_, _aristophorum_'; Prompt. Parv.; see Way's note.
'A _Costrelle_, oneferum, &c., vbi a flakett'; Cath. Angl. p. 77; see
Herrtage's note. See _costa_, _costarez_, _costarium_, _costrelli_, in
Ducange; and _coste_, _costeret_, _costerel_, in Godefroy. In the Craven
dialect, a _costril_ is the little wooden barrel carried by reapers.

2671. 'Lest that the time may seem long to him.' Ovid alludes to the
narcotic drink; Her. xiv. 42:--'quaeque tibi dederam uina, soporis erant.'
Cf. Kn. Tale, 614 (A 1472).

2676. The line is too short in most MSS. Unless _sone_ be supplied from MS.
T., we shall have to scan the line by putting _This_ (with a strong accent)
alone in the first foot. Cf. l. 2711, and slur over the _o_ in _Lino_
before _and_.

2680. Cf. Her. xiv. 44:--'Erigor, et capio tela tremente manu.'

2681. Accent _Zephírus_ on the _i_. From Her. xiv. 39:--

 'Utque leui Zephyro graciles uibrantur aristae,
    frigida populeas ut quatit aura comas.'

2682. From Her. xiv. 34:--'Securumque quies alta per Argos erat.'

2683. 'Sanguis abit; mentemque calor corpusque reliquit'; Her. xiv. 37.
And, in the next line--'frigida facta.'

2686. 'Ter male sublato decidit ense manus'; 46.

2690. From Her. xiv. 55, &c.:--

 'Femina sum et uirgo, natura mitis et annis.
    Non faciunt molles ad fera tela manus....
  Quid mihi cum ferro? Quo bellica tela puellae?'

2696. _And me beshende_, and bring myself to ruin, and perish. I know of
only one other example of this rare word, viz. the example given by Murray
from Cursor Mundi, l. 14838, where the Trinity MS. has: 'Allas! nu has he
[gh]u _bischent_'; alas! now has he ruined you. But it is a perfectly
legitimate compound from the M.E. _shenden_. All former editions give this
line wrongly; they omit _me_, and read 'and be shende,' explained by 'and
be destroyed.' Now, in the first place, this will not scan; and secondly,
the idea of adding a final _e_ to the pp. _beshend_ (more correctly
_beshent_) is a characteristic commentary on that ignorance of M.E. grammar
which is only too common. Yet the final _e_ must needs be added, for _ende_
(in l. 2697) is essentially dissyllabic. Hence it follows, irresistibly,
that _shende_ is not a past participle; and we are driven to see that
_beshende_ is the infinitive mood of a compound verb.

2697. _Nedes cost_, by condition of necessity, i.e. necessarily; see Kn.
Ta., 619 (A 1477), and the note.

2700. Supply _he_ before _hath_; cf. note to l. 2630.

2705. _Goter_, gutter, channel for water. This is an addition. The original
merely has (ll. 77, 78):--

 'Quaerenti caussam, "Dum nox sinit, effuge," dixi;
   "dum nox atra sinit, tu fugis, ipsa moror."'

2708. _Roggeth_, shaketh. '_Roggyn_, or mevyn, or scogghyn, rokkyn.
_Agito_'; Prompt. Parv. See P. Plowman, B. xvi. 78; and _ruggen_ in
Stratmann. Cf. Icel. _rugga_, to rock a cradle. Prof. Napier tells me that
the A.S. _roccan_, to rock, has been found in a gloss. Bell's edition has
the singular and unauthorised reading _jeggeth_ (_sic_).

2709. The rest of the story seems to be Chaucer's addition. Ovid merely has
(ll. 83, 84):--

 'Abstrahor a patriis pedibus; raptamque capillis
    (haec meruit pietas praemia) carcer habet.'

2710. _Doon him bote_, given him assistance.

2715. 'Her cruel father caused her to be seized,' lit. caused (men) to
seize her.

2723. 'This tale is told for the following reason.' And here the MSS. break
off, in the middle of the sentence.




NOTES TO THE TREATISE ON THE ASTROLABE.


The title 'Tractatus de Conclusionibus Astrolabii' is suggested by the
wording of the colophon on p. 223. But a better title is, simply,
'Tractatus de Astrolabio,' or 'Treatise on the Astrolabe,' as the
'Conclusiones' only occupy the Second Part of the work; see p. 188. Indeed
MS. F. has 'Tractatus Astrolabii'; see p. 233. MSS. B. and E. have the
singular title--'Bred and mylk for childeren.'

PROLOGUE, l. 1. _Lowis_ was at this time (1391) ten years old (see l. 18);
he was therefore born in 1381, whence it is possible that his mother was
the Cecilia de Chaumpaigne who, on May 1, 1380, released the poet from all
liability _de raptu meo_. This is, of course, a mere conjecture. Probably
Lowis died young, as nothing more is known concerning him.

5. _philosofre_; possibly Cicero. 'Haec igitur prima lex amicitiae
sanciatur, ut ... amicorum causâ honesta faciamus'; Lælius, cap. xiii.

7. _suffisaunt_, sufficiently good. In the best instruments, the
Almicanteras, or circles of altitude, were drawn at distances of one degree
only; in less-carefully made instruments, they were drawn at distances of
two degrees. The one given to his son by Chaucer was one of the latter; see
Part I, sect. 18, l. 8.

10. _a certein_, i.e. a certain number; but the word _nombre_ need not be
repeated; cf. _a certein holes_, Pt. I. sect. 13, l. 2, and see the very
expression in the Milleres Tale, l. 7 (A 3193).

21. _suffyse_, let them suffice.

32. Repeated from Ho. Fame, 861-2, q.v.

62. 'Nicolaus de Lynna, i.e. of Lynn, in Norfolk, was a noted astrologer in
the reign of Edward III., and was himself a writer of a treatise on the
Astrolabe. See Bale--who mentions "Joannes Sombe" as the collaborateur of
Nicolaus--"Istos ob eruditionem multiplicem, non vulgaribus in suo
Astrolabio celebrat laudibus Galfridus Chaucer poeta lepidissimus;" BALE
(edit. 1548), p. 152.'--Note by Mr. Brae, p. 21 of his edition of the
Astrolabe.

Warton says that 'John Some and Nicholas Lynne' were both Carmelite friars,
and wrote calendars constructed for the meridian of Oxford. He adds that
Nicholas Lynne is said to have made several voyages to the most northerly
parts of the world, charts of which he presented to Edward III. These
charts are, however, lost. See Hakluyt's Voyages, i. 121, ed. 1598; Warton,
Hist. E. P. ii. 357; ed. 1871.

Tyrwhitt, in his Glossary to Chaucer, s.v. _Somer_, has the following. 'The
Kalendar of John Somer is extant in MS. Cotton, Vesp. E. vii. It is
calculated for 140 years from 1367, the year of the birth of Richard II.,
and is said, in the introduction, to have been published in 1380, at the
instance of Joan, mother to the king. The Kalendar of Nicholas Lenne, or
Lynne, was calculated for 76 years from 1387. Tanner in v. _Nicolans
Linensis_. The story there quoted from Hakluit of a voyage made by this
Nicholas in 1360 _ad insulas septentrionales antehac Europæis incognitas_,
and of a book written by him to describe these countries _a gradu .54.
usque ad polum_, is a mere fable: as appears from the very authorities
which Hakluit has produced in support of it.' It seems probable, therefore,
that the 'charts' which Warton says are 'lost' were never in existence at
all. The false spelling 'Some' no doubt arose from neglecting the curl of
contraction in Som_er_e.

PART I. § 5, l. 5. _the remenant_, &c. i.e. the rest of this line (drawn,
as I said,) from the foresaid cross to the border. This appears awkward,
and we should have expected 'fro the forseide _centre_,' as Mr. Brae
suggests; but there is no authority for making the alteration. As the
reading stands, we must put no comma after 'this lyne,' but read right on
without a pause.

8. _principals._ It it not unusual to find adjectives of French origin
retaining _s_ in the plural; only they commonly _follow_ their nouns when
thus spelt. Cf. _lettres capitals_, i. 16. 8; _sterres fixes_, i. 21. 4. On
the other hand, we find _principal cercles_, i. 17. 34.

§ 7. 4. _noumbres of augrim_; Arabic numerals. The degrees of the border
are said to contain 4 minutes _of time_, whilst the degrees of the signs
are divided into minutes and seconds of angular measurement, the degrees in
each case being the same. There is no confusion in practice between these,
because the former are used in measuring time, the latter in measuring
angles.

§ 8. 9. _Alkabucius_; i.e. (says Warton, Hist. E. P. ii. 357, ed. 1871)
Abdilazi Alchabitius, whose Introductiorium ad scientiam judicialem
astronomæ was printed in 1473, and afterwards. Mr. Brae quotes the very
passage to which Chaucer refers, which I here quote from the edition of
1482, as described in my note to l. 119 of The Compleint of Mars (see vol.
i. p. 500); viz. 'Unumquodque istorum signorum diuiditur in 30 partes
equales, que gradus vocantur. Et gradus diuiditur in 60 minuta; et minutum
in 60 secunda; et secundum in 60 tertia. Similiterque sequuntur quarta,
scilicet et quinta, ascendendo usque ad infinita'; Alchabitii Differentia
Prima.

These minute subdivisions were never used; it was a mere affectation of
accuracy, the like of which was never attained.

§ 10. 5. _in Arabiens_, amongst the Arabians. But he goes on to speak only
of the Roman names of the months. Yet I may observe that in MS. Ii. 3. 3,
at fol. 97, the Arabian, Syrian, and Egyptian names of the months are given
as well as the Roman.

§ 16. 12. _& every minut 60 secoundes_; i.e. every minute contains 60
seconds. The sentence, in fact, merely comes to this. 'Every degree of the
border contains four minutes (_of time_), and every minute (of time)
contains sixty seconds (of time).' This is consistent and intelligible. Mr.
Brae proposes to read '_four_ seconds'; this would mean that 'every degree
of the border contains four minutes (of time), and every minute (_of the
border_) contains four seconds (of time).' Both statements are true; but,
in the latter case, Chaucer should have repeated the words 'of the
bordure.' However this may be, the proposed emendation lacks authority,
although the reprint of Speght changed 'lx' into 'fourtie,' which comes
near to 'four.' But the reprint of Speght is of no value at all. See Mr.
Brae's preface, p. 4, for the defence of his proposed emendation, which is
entirely needless.

§ 17. 6. _Ptholome._ The St. John's MS. has _ptolomeys almagest_.
'_Almagest_, a name given by the Arabs to the [Greek: megalê syntaxis], or
_great collection_, the celebrated work of Ptolemy, the astronomer of
Alexandria [floruit A.D. 140-160]. It was translated into Arabic about the
year A.D. 827, under the patronage of the Caliph Al Mamun, by the Jew
Alhazen ben Joseph, and the Christian Sergius. The word is the Arabic
article _al_ prefixed to the Greek _megistus_, "greatest," a name probably
derived from the title of the work itself, or, as we may judge from the
superlative adjective, partly from the estimation in which it was
held.'--English Cyclopædia; Arts and Sciences, i. 223. The Almagest 'was in
thirteen books. Ptolemy wrote also four books of judicial astrology. He was
an Egyptian astrologist, and flourished under Marcus Antoninus. He is
mentioned in the Sompnour's Tale [D 2289], and the Wif of Bathes Prologue,
ll. 182, 324.'--Warton, Hist. E. P. ii. 356, ed. 1871. The word _almagest_
occurs in the Milleres Tale, near the beginning (A 3208), and twice in the
Wif of Bathes Prologue (D 183, 325).

Chaucer says the obliquity of the ecliptic, according to Ptolemy, was 23°
50'. The _exact_ value, according to Ptolemy, was 23° 51' 20"; _Almagest_,
lib. i. c. 13. But Chaucer did not care about the odd degree, and gives it
nearly enough. See note to ii. 25. 19.

8. _tropos_, a turning; Chaucer gives it the sense of _agaynward_, i.e. in
a returning direction.

14. The equinoctial was supposed to revolve, because it was the 'girdle' of
the _primum mobile_, and turned with it. See note below to l. 28.

14, 15. 'As I have shewed thee in the solid sphere.' This is interesting,
as shewing that Chaucer had already given his son some lessons on the
motions of the heavenly bodies, before writing this treatise.

27. _angulus._ We should rather have expected the word _spera_ or _sphera_;
cf. 'the sper solide' above, l. 15.

28. 'And observe, that this first moving (_primus motus_) is so called from
the first movable (_primum mobile_) of the eighth sphere, which moving or
motion is from East to West,' &c. There is an _apparent_ confusion in this,
because the _primum mobile_ was the _ninth_ sphere (see Plate V, fig. 10);
but it may be called the movable of the eighth, as _giving motion to it_.
An attempt was made to explain the movements of the heavenly bodies by
imagining the earth to be in the centre, surrounded by a series of
concentric spheres, or rather shells, like the coats of an onion. Of these
the seven innermost, all revolving with different velocities, each carried
with it a planet. Beyond these was an eighth sphere, which was at first
supposed to be divided into two parts, the inner part being the
_firmamentum_, and the outer part the _primum mobile_; hence the _primum
mobile_ might have been called 'the first moving of the eighth sphere,' as
accounting for the more important part of the motion of the said sphere. It
is simpler, however, to make these distinct, in which case the eighth
sphere is _firmamentum_ or _sphæra stellarum fixarum_, which was supposed
to have a very slow motion from West to East round the poles of the
_zodiac_ to account for the precession of the equinoxes, whilst the ninth
sphere, or _primum mobile_, whirled round from East to West once in 24
hours, carrying all the inner spheres with it, by which means the ancients
accounted for the diurnal revolution. This ninth sphere had for its poles
the north and south poles of the heavens, and its 'girdle' (or great circle
equidistant from the poles) was the equator itself. Hence the equator is
here called the 'girdle of the first moving.' As the planetary spheres
revolved _in an opposite direction_, thus accounting for the _forward_
motion of the sun and planets in the ecliptic or near it, the _primum
mobile_ was considered to revolve in a _backward_ or _unnatural_ direction,
and hence Chaucer's apostrophe to it (Man of Lawes Tale, B 295):--

 'O firste moevyng cruel firmament,
  With thy diurnal sweigh that crowdest ay
  And hurlest all from Est til Occident,
  That naturelly wolde holde another way.'

That is--'O thou _primum mobile_, thou cruel firmament, that with thy
diurnal revolution (or revolution once in 24 hours round the axis of the
equator) continually forcest along and whirlest all the celestial bodies
from East to West, which _naturally_ would wish to follow the course of the
sun in the zodiac from West to East.' This is well illustrated by a
sidenote in the Ellesmere MS. to the passage in question, to this
effect:--'Vnde Ptholomeus, libro i. cap. 8. Primi motus celi duo sunt,
quorum vnus est qui mouet totum semper ab Oriente in Occidentem vno modo
super orbes, &c. Item aliter vero motus est qui mouet orbem stellarum
currencium contra motum primum, videlicet, ab Occidente in Orientum super
alios duos polos[72].' That is, the two chief motions are that of the
_primum mobile_, which carries everything round from East to West, and that
of the fixed stars, which is a slow motion from West to East round the axis
of the zodiac, to account for precession. This exactly explains the
well-known passage in the Frankeleines Tale (C. T., F 1280):--

 'And by his eighte spere in his werking,
  He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove
  Fro the heed of thilke fixe Aries above
  That in the ninthe spere considered is.'

Here the eight spheres are the eight inner spheres which revolve round the
axis of the zodiac in an easterly direction, whilst the ninth sphere, or
_primum mobile_, contained both the theoretical or _fixed_ first point of
Aries from which measurements were made, and also the _signs_ of the zodiac
as distinct from the _constellations_. But Alnath, being an actual star,
viz, [alpha] Arietis[73], was in the _eighth_ sphere; and the distance
between its position and that of the first point of Aries at any time
afforded a measure of the amount of precession. Mr. Brae rightly remarks
that Tyrwhitt's readings in this passage are correct (except that _eighte
speres_ should be _eightespere_), and those of Mr. Wright and Dr. Morris
(from the Harleian MS.) are incorrect.

It may be as well to add that a later refinement was to insert a
crystalline sphere, to account for the precession; so that the order stood
thus: seven spheres of planets; the eighth, of fixed stars; the ninth, or
crystalline; the tenth, or _primum mobile_; and, beyond these, an empyræan
or theological heaven, so to speak, due to no astronomical wants, but used
to express the place of residence of celestial beings[74]. Hence the
passage in Milton, P. L. iii. 481:--

 'They pass the planets seven, and pass the fix'd,
  And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
  The trepidation talk'd, and that first mov'd.'

i.e. They pass the seven planetary spheres; then the sphere of fixed stars;
then the crystalline or transparent one, whose swaying motion or libration
measures the amount of the precession and nutation so often talked of; and
then, the sphere of the _primum mobile_ itself. But Milton clearly himself
believed in the Copernican system; see Paradise Lost, viii. 121-140, where
the _primum mobile_ is described in the lines--

                           'that swift
  Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,
  Invisible else above all stars, the wheel
  Of day and night.'

§ 18. 8. _compowned by 2 & 2._ This means that in the _best_ astrolabes,
_every_ almicantarath for every degree of latitude was marked; as may be
seen in Metius. In others, including the one given by Chaucer to his son,
they were marked only for every other degree. See Part II. sect. 5, l. 2.

§ 19. 7. _cenith_, as here used, has a totally different meaning from that
of _senith_, in l. 1 above. The _senith_ in l. 1 is what we still call the
_zenith_; but the _cenith_ in l. 7 means the point of the horizon denoting
the sun's place in azimuth. Contrary to what one might expect, the _latter_
is the true original meaning, as the word _zenith_ is corrupted from the
root of the word which we now spell _azimuth_. The Arabic _as-sant_ is a
way or path; _al-samt_, a point of the horizon, and, secondly, an azimuthal
circle. The plural of _al-samt_ is _assum[=u]t_, whence _azimuth_. But
_zenith_ is a corruption of _semt_, from _samt al-r[=a]s_, the Arabic name
of the vertex of heaven (_r[=a]s_ meaning _a head_); and the qualifying
_al-r[=a]s_, the most important part of the phrase, has been improperly
dropped. So far from the reading _cenith_ being wrong here, it is most
entirely right, and may be found (better spelt _cenit_) in the same sense
in Messahala. See p. 213, second footnote. For _cenith_, some late copies
have _signet_, evidently taken from the Latin word _signum_. They make the
same mistake even in l. 12 of section 18.

§ 21. 4. _sterres fixes_, fixed stars; here the _s_ again appears in a
plural adjective of French derivation; see note above, to § 5. 8. In MSS.
Ii. 3. 3 and Ii. 1. 13 in the Cambridge University Library, is an
interesting list of the 49 stars most usually placed upon the Astrolabe.
The stars which are represented by the points of the tongues in Fig. 2 are
the same as those in the diagram from which Fig. 2 is copied, the original
of which is in MS. A. I have slightly altered the positions of the points
of the tongues, to make them somewhat more correct. The following is the
list of the stars there shewn; most of their names are written in the MS.
Cf. footnote on p. 186.

_Within the Zodiac._ In _Aries_, Mirach, or [beta] Andromedæ, shewn by a
short tongue above Aries; in _Taurus_, Algol, or [beta] Persei, as marked;
in _Libra_, Aliot or Alioth, i.e. [epsilon] Ursæ Majoris (the third horse,
next the cart, in Charles's Wain), as marked; also Alramech, Arcturus, or
[alpha] Boötis, shewn by the tongue projecting above Libra; in _Scorpio_,
Alpheta, Alphecca, or [alpha] Coronæ Borealis, as marked; in _Sagittarius_,
Raz Alhagus, or [alpha] Ophiuchi, near Alpheta; in _Capricornus_, Altair or
[alpha] Aquilæ and Vega or [alpha] Lyræ, as marked, whilst near Vega is the
unmarked Arided, or [alpha] Cygni; and in _Pisces_, Markab or [alpha]
Pegasi.

_Without the Zodiac._ In _Aries_, under _Oriens_, the slight projection
marks [beta] Ceti or Deneb Kaitos, the Whale's Tail, and the next curiously
shaped projection (with side-tongues probably referring to other stars)
means Batnkaitos, the Whale's Belly, apparently [zeta] Ceti; next come the
long tongue for Menkar or [alpha] Ceti, the Whale's Nose; the star
Aldebaran or Bull's Eye, [alpha] Tauri; Rigel or [beta] Orionis, Orion's
Foot; Alhabor or Sirius, the Dog-star, marked by a rude drawing of a dog's
head, the star itself being at the tip of his tongue; then Algomeisa,
Procyon, or [alpha] Canis Minoris, marked by a tongue pointing to the left,
whilst the long broad tongue pointing upwards is Regulus, Kalbalased, or
[alpha] Leonis; the small tongue above the letter I in the border is
Alphard or Cor Hydræ. Above _Occidens_, in _Libra_, the first tongue is
Algorab or [delta] Corvi, and the next Spica Virginis or Azimech; close to
the 8th degree of Scorpio is [alpha] Libræ, and close to the beginning of
Sagittarius is a small head, denoting the Scorpion, at the tip of the
tongue of which is the bright Kalbalacrab or Antares. The last, a
projection below the letter X, is Deneb Algebi or the Goat's Tail, i.e.
[delta] Capricorni.

7. That is, the little point at the end of each tongue of metal is
technically called the 'centre' of the star, and denotes its exact
position.

9. The stars of the North are those to the North of the _zodiac_, not of
the _equator_.

12. _Aldeberan_, &c.; the stars Aldebaran ([alpha] Tauri) and Algomeisa
([alpha] Canis Minoris) are called stars of the south, because they are to
the south of the ecliptic; but as they are meanwhile (see Fig. 2) also to
the north of the equator, they of course rise to the N. of the Eastern
point of the horizon. The longitude of stars was always measured along the
ecliptic, which is denoted in Fig. 2 by the outermost circle of the metal
ring on which the names of the signs are written.

In one of the tracts in MS. G (dated A.D. 1486), p. 30, we find 'Aldebaran,
in the first gre of ge_min_is (_sic_), of the nature of Mars and Venus';
and 'Algomeisa, canis minor, in the xvij gr_e_ of Canc_er_, of the nature
of Mars and M_er_cury.'

29. _Amiddes_, &c. Observe that the Ecliptic line _in the midst_ of the
_celestial_ zodiac, a belt 12° broad, is on the _outer edge_ of the zodiac
as shewn in the astrolabe, which is only 6° broad and shews only the
northern half of that belt. The 'way of the sun' is elsewhere used of the
sun's apparent _diurnal_ path (see Part ii. sect. 30); but it here refers,
as is more usual, to the _annual_ path.

34. _streitnes_, narrowness, closeness, smallness of size. In Fig. 2, I
have marked every degree in the southern half of the zodiac, but only every
_fifth_ degree in the northern, in order to avoid an appearance of crowding
in so small a figure. In Chaucer's own Astrolabe, every _other_ degree was
marked all round.

40. Here Chaucer gives at least three reasons for the name of 'zodiac.' The
true one is the second, 'for that the sterres that ben there fixed ben
disposed in signes of bestes, or shape like bestes.' But these imaginary
shapes are very absurd and arbitrary.

50. Not only the influences here assigned to the signs, but others due to
planets, may be found in 'Porphyrii Philosophi introductio in Claudii
Ptolomæi opus de affectibus astrorum,' fol. Basileæ, n.d. p. 198. I here
add a few extracts from the MS. in Trinity College, Cambridge (marked R.
15. 18), to shew the nature of the old astrology. I choose them with
especial reference to Aries. The other signs are spoken of in a similar
manner. 'It is principally to be considered that the signes of hevyn haue
their_e_ strenght and propre significaciou_n_ vpon the membris of eny man;
as, Aries hath respect to the hed, taurus to the neck, ge_min_is (_sic_)
the Armys, Cancer the brest, leo the hert, virgo the bowels, &c.; as it
shall shew in the Chapiters folowyng. Secundarily it is to be noted that
plotholomee (_sic_) saith, that to touche with instrument of yrou_n_ while
the mone is in the signe of the same membre, is for to be dred; let the
surgen beware, and the letter of blode, let hym be aferd to touche that
membre w_i_t_h_ yren_e_, in the which the mone shal be.'--MS. G; Trad C. p.
12.

'Thenne Aries hath respect to the hed; And this signe is hote and dry,
fiery & colerik. Saturne hath ij witnes in Ariete, a triplicitate and a
terme. Jubit_er_ also hath ij, a triplicitate and a term_e_. Mars hath iij
testimonials or iij fortitudis in Ariete, A hows, A face, and A terme. The
sonne hath iij fortitudis in Ariete, s_cilicet_, an exaltaciou_n_, a
triplicite, and a face. Venus hath ij testimonials, A terme and a face.
M_er_cury hath on_e_ testymony, that is to sey, a term_e_. And luna in
Ariete hath no testimoniall. For the which it is to know, that the influens
of the planet_is_ may be fortyfied v maner of wayes. And these v man_er_ be
called v fortitud_is_ of planet_is_, or testimonials, which be these:
_domus_, _exaltacio_, _triplicitas_, _terminus_, and _facies_. _Domus_
gevith to a planet v fortitud_is_; And a planet in his hows is lyke a kynge
in his hall, And in the high trone of his gl_or_ie. A planet in his
_exaltacioun_ is lyke a kynge when he is crowned. A planet in his
_triplicite_ is like a kynge in hono_ur_, Amonge his sencible people. A
planet in his _terme_ is As a man_n_ among_es_ his kynnesmen_n_ And
fryndis. _Facies_ gyvith to a planet that thyng the which rowme gyvith to a
maistre. Wherfore _facies_ gyvith only on fortitude, _Terminus_ ij,
_Triplicitas_ iij, _Exaltacio_ iiij, And _domus_ v. And for the more clere
declaraciou_n_, the dignytes of planet_is_ in signes be co_m_p_re_hendid in
this figure ensuynge, &c.[75]'--Same MS., Tract C. p. 13.

'The dygnytes of planet_is_ in the signes, most speciall they be to be
noted in iudicials. When the mone is _in Ariete_, it is not gode, but
vtterly to be exshewed, both for seke And disesid, for to shafe their_e_
hede or to boist in the eris or in the nek; nor loke þou let no blode in
the vayn of the hede. How-be-it, benyficiall it is to begynne eu_er_y worke

to be eschewed. In this signe it is necessary to dele with noble estat_is_
And rich men, And for to go in-to A bayn_e_ [_bath_][76].'--Same MS., Tract
C. p. 14.

54, 5. See Prologue, l. 73. As the zodiak is here called a part of the
eighth sphere, so we have been before told that the equinoctial is the
girdle of the ninth sphere; see note above to sect 17. l. 28.

57. _evene parties_, equal parts. That is, the equinoctial bisects the
zodiac. But the northern half _looks_ much smaller than the southern on the
Astrolabe, owing to the manner in which the zodiac is there represented,
viz. by projection on the plane of the equator.


PART II. § 1. Rubric, _hir cours_. The gender of the sun was feminine in
Anglo-Saxon, and that of the moon masculine; but in Chaucer's time, the
gender was very variable, owing to the influence of Latin and French.

§ 3. Between sections 2 and 3, a section is inserted in the late copies,
which merely repeats section 1, and is clearly spurious. It does not appear
at all in the best MSS.; though it is found in the black-letter editions. I
quote it here from MS. L.

'TO KNOWE THE DEGRE OF THYN SONNE IN THYN ZODIAK BY THE DAYS IN THE BAKSYDE
OFF THE ASTROLABYE.

'[T]hanne iff þou wylte wete thatt / rekyn & knowe / qwych is the day off
the monyth thatt thow arte yn_n_e, & ley thy rewle of thy astrolabye, that
is to sey, the allydatha, vpon þe day in the kalendr_e_ off the Astrolabye,
& he schall schewe the thy degree of the sonne.'

26, 7. After 'assendent,' the following additional paragraph occurs in MS.
Bodley 619; fol. 21. It is worthy of notice, because the original of it
appears in Messahala's treatise, with the title 'De noticia stellarum
incognitarum positarum in astrolabio.' The paragraph runs thus:--

'Nota. þat by þis conclusio_n_ þou may knowe also where ben at þat same
tyme all_e_ oþir sterres fixed þ_a_t ben sette in thin Astrelabie, and in
what place of þe firmament; And also her arising in thy orizonte, and how
longe þ_a_t thei wol ben aboue þe erthe wiþ þe Arke of þe nyght / And loke
eu_er_more hov many degrees þou fynde eny sterre at þat tyme sitting vpon
þin Almycant_er_as, and vp-on as many degrees sette þou þe reule vpon þe
altitude in þe border_e_; And by the mediaciou_n_ of þy eye through þe .2.
smale holes shalt thou se þe same sterre by the same altitude aforseid, And
so by this conclusiou_n_ may þou redely knowe whiche is oo sterre from
a-noþ_er_ in the firmament / for as many as ben in the Astrelabie. For by
þ_a_t same altitude shal thou se that same sterre, & non othir / for þ_er_e
ne woll_e_ non othir altitude accorde þerto.'

30. _Alhabor_; i.e. Sirius or the Dog-star, as is evident from the fact of
its being represented by a dog's head on the Astrolabe; see also the table
of stars marked on the Astrolabe (in MS. Camb. Univ. Lib. li. 3. 3, fol.
70, back), which gives the declination 15° S, the latitude 39° S, and
places the star in Cancer. It is also plainly described in the same table
as being 'in ore canis', so that it is difficult to resist the conclusion
of the identity of Alhabor and Sirius. Mr. Brae, following later copies
that have different readings of the numbers employed, identifies Alhabor
with Rigel or [beta] Orionis. This is impossible, from the fact that Rigel
and Alhabor _both_ occur in the diagrams and tables; see, for instance,
Fig. 2. It is true that Rigel was sometimes called _Algebar_, but _Alhabor_
stands rather for the Arabic _Al-'ab[=u]r_. The Arabic name for the
constellation Canis Major was _Al-kalb al-akbar_, 'greater dog,' as
distinguished from _Al-kalb al-asghar_, or 'lesser dog'; and the star
[alpha] Canis Majoris was called _Al-shi'ra al-'ab[=u]r_, the former of
which terms represented the Greek [Greek: seirios] (_Sirius_), whilst from
the latter (_al-'ab[=u]r_) we have our _Alhabor_. See Ideler, Über den
Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen, pp. 237, 256.

§ 4. 'The houses [in astrology] have different powers. The strongest of all
these is the first, which contains the part of the heaven about to rise:
this is called the _ascendant_; and the point of the ecliptic which is just
rising is called the horoscope.'--English Encyclopædia; art. Astrology.

21. In the English Cyclopædia, art. Astrology, a quotation is given from an
astrological work, in reply to the question whether the 'querent' should
succeed as a cattle-dealer. It contains some words very similar to
Chaucer's. 'If the lord of the sixth be in quartile, or in opposition to
the dispositor of the part of Fortune, or the Moon, the querent cannot
thrive by dealing in small cattle. The same if the lord of the sixth be
afflicted either by Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon's Tail; or be found either
retrograde, combust, cadent, or peregrine. [See l. 33.] The Dragon's Tail
and Mars shew much loss therein by knaves and thieves, and ill bargains,
&c.; and Saturn denotes much damage by the rot or murrain.' The evil
influence of the Dragon's Tail is treated of in the last chapter of
'Hermetis Philosophi de revolutionibus nativitatum', fol. Basileæ; n.d.

32. 'May seen the ascendant.' Cf. 'Cum dominator ascendens viderit, res quæ
occulta est secundum ascendentis naturam erit; quod si non videt, illud
erit secundum naturam loci in quo ipse est dominator'; Cl. Ptolemæi
_Centiloquium_; sect. 90.

33. _combust_, said of a planet when its light is quenched by being too
near the sun. Tyrwhitt, in his Glossary, says that it is used when the
planet is not more than 8½ degrees distant from the sun. Cf. Troilus, iii.
717, and the note.

40. _Face._ See note to Part I. sect. 21. l. 50 (p. 359). The late copies
are very incorrect hereabouts.

§ 6. 9. Mr. Brae well calls attention here to the absurd errors in the
printed copies. Thynne has 'in the 320 signe,' and Speght 'in the xxiii
signe.' The signs of the zodiac are only twelve, and the one opposite to
the 1st is the 7th.

§ 8. I see no reason for supposing this proposition to be an interpolation,
as Mr. Brae suggests. Though similar to § 11, it is not identical with it.
Moreover, it occurs in Messahala.

§ 9. 2. _the chapitre beforn_, i.e. a previous chapter, viz. in sect. 6.
The expression supplies no argument for altering the order of the
'conclusions.'

4. _same manere_, i.e. a like manner. The 'vulgar night' clearly means that
the quantity of the 'crepuscules' must be _subtracted_ from the 'arch of
the night.'

§ 13. 5. _cours_, course; _heyest cours_, highest point of the path. Late
copies have _lyne_; for which Mr. Brae suggested _degre_.

§ 14. 6. _but 2 degrees_. Suppose the sun's midday altitude is 49°, in
latitude 52°. Then the co-latitude is 38°, and the sun's declination 11°
North. This corresponds nearly (roughly speaking) to the 1st degrees of
Taurus and Virgo. Which is right can 'lightly' be known by the time of
year, for the sun cannot be in Virgo if the month be April. Compare sect.
15.

§ 17. This conclusion, as pointed out in the footnote, is not correct in
theory, but can be made nearly so in practice, by taking the two altitudes
_very near_ the meridian. This is directly implied in the words 'passeth
any-thing the sowth westward,' i.e. passes _ever so little_ westward of the
south line; cf. note below to 38. 10. Consequently, the first observation
must also be taken very near the meridian.

25. _site_, situation. Late copies, _sight_. This proves that the word
_site_ is Chaucerian, and clears up the reading in Ho. Fame, 1114.

§ 18. Instead of reckoning a star's right ascension by referring it to the
equator, it was reckoned by observing the degree of the zodiac which
southed along with it. This is expressed in the first 'Table of fixed
stars' in MS. Camb. Univ. Lib. Ii. 3. 3 (fol. 70, back) by the phrase 'cum
gradibus, quibus celum mediant'; the other co-ordinate of position was the
star's declination from the equator, as in the modern method. The ancients
also used the co-ordinates of longitude and latitude of a star, the
longitude being reckoned along the ecliptic, and the latitude along great
circles through the poles of the ecliptic; as appears from the second Table
in the same MS.

§ 19. 6. _equinoxial._ This, as explained in the footnote, should be
'ecliptik'; but I can find no MS. authority for the alteration, though the
correction is practically made in l. 13.

§ 22. 13. _place._ Late copies and old editions, _planet_; absurdly.
Latitudes of several places are given in old Latin MSS. They are frequently
incorrect.

§ 23. 3. The star A is shewn by the numbers to be the Pole-star, and is
obviously the one to be observed in order to find the altitude of the Pole.
What the star F is, is of no consequence. The numbers used in other copies
are different, and much less satisfactory. That the star A is the Pole-star
or some star near the pole in this 'conclusion' is rendered probable also
by the wording of the next 'conclusion'; which extends the working of it to
the case of any other star, provided it be a star that never sets.

§ 25. 19. When Chaucer says that the latitude of Oxford is 'certain minutes
less,' he probably means no more than that the latitude of Oxford was 51
degrees and 50 minutes, as in the text. For I suspect the original reading
of the passage made the sun's altitude 38 degrees only, and the latitude 52
degrees; indeed, the passage stands so in MSS. C and P, both good
authorities. But he added the statement that the latitude of Oxford was
less than 52 degrees. It is probable that, on second thoughts, he put in
the number of _minutes_, and forgot to strike out the clause 'I sey nat
this,' &c., which was no longer necessary. Minutes were seldom reckoned
otherwise than by _tens_; 'a few minutes less than 50' (say 47) is a
refinement to which the ancients seldom attained. Hence the amount of 10
minutes is vaguely spoken of in l. 31 as 'odde Minutes.' Minutes were
clearly not much considered. In the present case, we are assisted by
Chaucer's express statement in sect. 22. l. 6. The true latitude of Oxford
is between 51° 45' and 51° 46'.

§ 26. 8-11. It is singular that this sentence, obviously wanted, should
appear only in one MS., and has, accordingly, been omitted in all previous
editions. There can be no doubt about the genuineness of it, as it so
exactly gives the right sense, and happily supplies the words 'right
orisonte' in l. 11; thus enabling the author to say, as in l. 21 he _does_
say--'this _forseid_ righte orisonte.'

16. _this figure._ Here occurs, in some of the MSS., a diagram representing
a circle, i.e, a disc of the astrolabe, with straight lines drawn across it
from left to right.

17. _assensiouns in the righte cercle._ This exactly answers to our modern
'right ascension.' We hence obtain the true origin of the phrase. 'Right
ascension' was, originally, the ascension of stars at places situate _on
the equator_, and was most conveniently measured along the equatorial
circle, by observation of the times of transit of the various stars across
the meridian. In other latitudes, the ascension of every degree of the
_zodiac_ could be easily tabulated by observing what degree of the equator
came to the meridian with the said degree of the zodiac; see l. 20. It
hence appears that, whilst persisting in using 'longitudes' and reckoning
along the zodiac, the ancients were obliged, in practice, to refer the
degrees of longitude to the equator. The modern method of recognizing this
necessity, and registering right ascensions as of more importance than
longitudes, is a great improvement. The ancients were restrained from it by
their unnecessary reverence for the zodiac. Cf. Ptolemy's Almagest, lib. i.
c. xiii.

§ 29. Chaucer omits to say that the experiment should be made when the sun
is very nearly on the meridian. Otherwise, the confusion of the azimuth
with the hour-angle might cause a considerable error.

§ 30. 3. That the phrase 'wey of the sonne' really means the sun's apparent
_diurnal_ course in this conclusion, may be further seen by consulting the
Latin of Messahala. Cf. the Critical Note on p. 236.

§ 31. In my footnote, I have used the expression 'it does not mean, _as it
should_, the zenith point.' I mean--'as, according to our modern ideas, it
should';--for the derivation of _zenith_ shews that the meaning used in
this proposition is the older meaning of the two. See note above to i. 19.
7 (p. 357).

6. _24 parties._ These 24 parts were suggested by the 24 hours of the day.
The '32 parts' used by 'shipmen' are due to the continual halving of
angles. Thus, the four cardinal points have points half-way between them,
making eight points; between which, we can insert eight more, making
sixteen; and between these, sixteen more, making thirty-two. Hence the 32
points of the compass.

§ 33. 5. We should probably insert _or south_ after the word _north_. Such
an insertion is authorised by MSS. B. and C.

§ 34. 3. That 'upon the mones syde' means nearly in the same azimuth as the
moon, is apparent from l. 11 below, where Chaucer says that some treatises
make no exception even if the star is _not_ quite in the same azimuth. This
was certainly a rough mode of observation.

§ 35. 9. _right side_, East side. See i. 6. 1 (p. 179).

18. _episicle_, epicycle. To account for the planetary motions, epicycles
were invented. The moon, for instance, was supposed to revolve round a
_moving_ centre, which centre itself moved round the earth in a perfect
circle. This came a little nearer to the true motion in some instances, but
was hopelessly wrong, and nothing could be made of it, even when a _second_
epicycle, revolving about a centre which moved in the _first_ epicycle, was
superadded. All that Chaucer says here is, that, whilst the centre of the
moon's epicycle had a direct motion, the moon's motion in the epicycle
itself was a reverse one, unlike that of the other planetary bodies. The
subject is hardly worth further discussion, so I merely refer the reader to
the Almagest, lib. iv. c. 5; and lib. ix. c. 5.

§ 36. The 'equations of houses' means the dividing of the sphere into
_equal_ portions, and the right numbering of those portions or houses. The
most important house was the first, or ascendent, just rising; the next in
importance was the tenth, which was just coming on the meridian; then come
the seventh or descendent, just about to set, and the fourth, just coming
to the line of midnight. The next in importance were the _succedents_, or
houses immediately following these, viz. the second, the eleventh, the
eighth, and the fifth. The least important were the third, twelfth, ninth,
and sixth. See Fig. 14.

§ 37. 18. _thise 3 howsez._ That is, the nadirs of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
houses give the houses that 'follow,' i.e. the 8th, 9th, and 10th. The word
'follow' here seems to refer, not to position, but to the order in which
the houses may most conveniently be found. Chaucer omits to add that the
beginnings of the 5th and 6th houses can be found in a similar way, because
it is sufficiently evident. It is all from Messahala.

§ 38. 1. _for warping, the brodere the bettre._ This may mean, either (1)
to prevent warping, the thicker the better; or (2) to prevent the errors
arising from warping (for fear of warping), the larger the better. I
believe the latter to be the true interpretation; for it is better thus to
guard against possible errors than to make the plate very thick and, at the
same time, small. Besides which, the usual meaning of _brodere_ is _wider,
larger, more ample_. Indeed, we find the very expression 'non sit tamen
nimis parvus' in the 4th section of the Practica Chilindri of John Hoveden,
published by the Chaucer Society; which see.

8. _fro the centre_, i.e. sticking up above the centre, the length of the
wire being equal to a fourth of the diameter, or half the radius, of the
circle. This proportion would do for many days in the year; but in the
summer time, the pin would bear to be rather longer. Still, we need not
alter the text. Cf. the Critical Note on p. 237.

10. _any-thing_, i.e. ever so little; so _ony-thyng_ in l. 13; cf. § 17. 6.

§ 39. Though MS. A is rather corrupt here, there is little doubt about the
corrections to be made. See the Critical Notes, p. 237.

19. That is, the latitude, or breadth, of a climate, or belt, is measured
along a line which goes from North to South as far as the earth extends; so
that the latitude of the _first_ climate, for example, is measured from the
beginning of it to the end of the same, in a due northerly direction. Other
authors, he explains, reckoned the latitude of a climate always from the
equinoxial line, instead of from the parallel of latitude which terminated
the climate immediately to the south of it. Thus the latitude of the fourth
climate might mean, either the breadth of that belt _itself_, or the
_whole_ breadth from the equator to the Northern limit of that climate. The
MS. E. 2 in St. John's College, Cambridge, contains (besides Chaucer's
'Astrolabe') a Latin treatise entitled 'De septe_m_ climatib_us_
expositio.' We find mention of the 'climates' also in MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 3,
fol. 33 _b_, where a diagram appears representing a hemisphere, divided by
parallels of latitude into 9 climates or belts, which, beginning from the
equator, are as follows. 1. Inhabitabile propter Calorem. 2. Primum clima
dia Meroes. 3. Secundum clima dya cienes. 4. Tertium clima di' alexandrios.
5. Quartum clima dia rodos. 6. Quintum clima dia romes. 7. Sextum clima dia
boristenes. 8. Septimum clima dia rifeos. 9. Inhabitabile. This agrees with
the list in the footnote on p. 221.

There is a passage in Mandeville which well illustrates Chaucer; I quote
the part of it which more immediately relates to the Climates. 'For the
Superficialtee of the Erthe is departed in 7 parties, for the 7 Planetes;
and the parties ben clept Clymates. And oure parties be not of the 7
Clymates: for they ben descendynge toward the West. And also these yles of
Ynde, which beth evene a[gh]enst us, beth noght reckned in the Climates:
for thei ben a[gh]enst us, that ben in the lowe Contree. And the 7 Clymates
strecchen hem, envyrounynge the World,' &c. Mandeville's Voiage, ed.
Halliwell, p. 186. See also Ptolemy's Almagest, lib. ii.

As regards the longitudes of towns, it may be observed that in MS. F. 25 in
St. John's College, Cambridge, the longitudes of Rome, Cordova, London,
Paris, and Malta, are said to be 34° 24', 9° 30', 19°, 20°, and 38°
respectively. These do not well agree together, but they suggest a
reckoning from a meridian situated some 20° W. from that of Greenwich.
Chaucer says nothing as to what meridian was used for reckoning longitudes
from; and Messahala says, vaguely enough, that longitudes were reckoned 'a
meridiano circulo ultime regionis habitabilis in occidente,' i.e. from the
most westward habitable place, which possibly once meant Madeira.

§ 40. It is possible that this conclusion was really intended to belong to
the Fourth Part of the treatise, and was written by way of instalment. See
the Prologue, ll. 67-72. It is curious that in all the best MSS. (P.
excepted) the last sentence should be incomplete.

13. This sentence is very awkward. It seems to mean--'and then set I the
point of F upward in the same sign, because that the latitude was north,
upon the latitude of Venus; that is to say, (I set it upward) keeping it in
the 6th degree of Capricorn.' _Upward_ means inward, i.e. towards the
centre or towards the north; the opposite being expressed by southward, or
outward, or toward the border, as in l. 48 below. _Upon the latitude of
Venus_ means that the point F of the compass was set above the second
degree of latitude, so that the space between the legs of the compass
became equal to 2 degrees, as said in l. 16. Lastly, the words _that is to
seyn, in the 6 degree_, &c., are an explanation of the vaguer expression
_in the same signe_. The repetition of the words _that is to seyn_, &c.
(ll. 12 and 14), is intended to draw attention to the necessity of keeping
_both_ legs of the compass in the same degree of longitude (A on the
zodiac, and F to the north of it).

57. Possibly Chaucer left the sentence incomplete. The words 'thou shalt do
well enough' may easily have been added by another hand to bring the
sentence to an apparent, though not wholly satisfactory, conclusion. The
colophon is written (in a later hand) in MS. A. at the bottom of the page,
a part of which, after the words 'howre after howre,' is left blank.

41-43. I have mended the text as well as I could by inserting words, and
adopting different readings. Nearly all the emendations rest on authority;
see the Critical Notes. The text is not a good one, but I do not see why
these sections may not have been written by Chaucer. For a definition of
the terms 'Umbra Extensa' and 'Umbra Versa' see sections 5 and 6 of the
Practica Chilindri of John Hoveden, published by the Chaucer Society. The
_umbra extensa_ or _recta_ is the shadow cast on a plain by any perfectly
upright object; but the restriction is commonly introduced, that the
altitude of the sun shall exceed 45º. The _umbra versa_ is the shadow cast
_perpendicularly_ downwards along a wall by a style which projects from the
wall at right angles to it; the restriction is commonly introduced, that
the sun's altitude shall be less than 45°. The _umbra versa_ is the one
which appeared on the 'chylindre'; hence John de Hoveden explains how to
calculate the altitude of an object by it.

44. This article and the next may possibly be Chaucer's. It is well known
that he speaks of 'collect' and 'expans yeres' and 'rotes' in the
Frankeleines Tale; Cant. Ta., F 1275, 6, the note upon which in the
glossary to Urry's Chaucer may be found also in Tyrwhitt's Glossary, s.v.
_Expans_; but it is worth while to repeat it here. 'In this and the
following verses, the Poet describes the Alphonsine Astronomical Tables by
the several parts of them, wherein some technical terms occur, which were
used by the old astronomers, and continued by the compilers of those
tables. _Collect_ years are certain sums of years, with the motions of the
heavenly bodies corresponding to them, as of 20, 40, 60, &c., disposed into
tables; and _Expans_ years are the single years, with the motions of the
heavenly bodies answering to them, beginning at 1, and continued on to the
smallest _Collect_ sum, as 20. A _Root_, or _Radix_, is any certain time
taken at pleasure, from which, as an era, the celestial motions are to be
computed. By 'proporcionels convenientes' [C. T., F 1278] are meant the
Tables of Proportional parts.' To which Moxon adds, from Chamber's
Encyclopædia, with reference to C. T., F 1277, that '_Argument_ in
astronomy is an arc whereby we seek another unknown arc proportional to [or
rather, dependent upon] the first.'

Tables of mean motions of the Sun are given in Ptolemy's Almagest, lib.
iii. c. 2; of the Moon, lib. iv. c. 3; of the Planets, lib. viii. c. 3;
also in MS. Ii. 3. 3, fol. 88_b_, &c.

41_A_-42_B_. The fact that these articles are mere repetitions of sections
41-43 is almost conclusive against their genuineness. I do not suppose that
sect 46 (at p. 229) is Chaucer's either, but it is added for the sake of
completeness.

ACCOUNT OF THE SOURCES OF THE CANTERBURY TALES.

THE NINE GROUPS.

§ 1. The idea of joining together a series of Tales by means of fitting
them into a common frame-work is a very old one, and doubtless originated
in the East. There is an English collection of this character known as 'The
Seven Sages,' of which various versions have come down to us. The earliest
of these, as published in the second volume of Weber's Metrical Romances,
has been dated about 1320; and is, at any rate, older than any of Chaucer's
poems. Another collection, of a similar character, and likewise of Eastern
origin, is a Latin work by Petrus Alphonsus, a converted Spanish Jew,
entitled De Clericali Disciplina. See Dunlop's History of Fiction, chap.
vii. From one of these Chaucer may have taken the general idea of arranging
his tales in a connected series; and we must not forget that his Legend of
Good Women, which was the immediate forerunner of his greater work, is
likewise, practically, a collection of Tales, though sadly lacking in
variety, as he discovered for himself in the course of writing it. It is
highly improbable that he was indebted for the idea to Boccaccio's
Decamerone, as has been sometimes hastily suggested; since we might, in
that case, have expected that he would also have drawn from that collection
the plot of some one of his tales; which is not found to be the case. The
Clerk's Tale occurs, indeed, in the Decamerone; but we know it to have been
borrowed from Petrarch's Latin version of it. The Franklin's Tale has some
resemblance to another tale in the same collection, but was evidently not
taken from it directly, and the same is true in other cases; so that we are
quite justified in supposing that Chaucer was wholly unacquainted, at first
hand, with Boccaccio's work.

§ 2. It was suggested by Professor Seeley that we may profitably compare
the form of Chaucer's Prologue with that of the somewhat similar Prologue
to William's Vision concerning Piers the Plowman, a work which was very
popular in England just at the same time. William introduces us to a
Vision, in which he first of all beholds a Field full of Folk, and
describes, in succession, the various sets of folk of which the company
consisted; such as ploughmen, anchorites, hermits, chapmen, minstrels,
beggars, pilgrims, palmers, friars, a pardoner, parish-priests, bishops,
lawyers, and stewards. Chaucer seized upon the happy idea of limiting each
class to a single individual, and the still happier idea of combining them
into a company with a common object which allowed them to associate
together on nearly equal terms. And having thus chosen his representative
of each class, he employed his wonderful dramatic power in producing an
exact description of each; so that, to quote the words of Dryden, 'he has
taken into the compass of his Canterbury Tales the various manners and
humours (as we now call them) of the whole English nation, in his age.'

§ 3. As to the date when this idea of forming a continuous series of tales
was first entertained, we can hardly be wrong in dating it from 1386 or
1387 onwards. As it was left in an incomplete state, it was most likely in
hand up to the time of his death, though he probably neglected it towards
the last. The year 1385 is, almost certainly, the date of his Prologue to
the Legend of Good Women, and of his first attempt to write in heroic
couplets[77]. He was then full of the idea of writing a series of stories
concerning 'Good Women,' and himself tells us that he intended to write
stories of nineteen Women, to be followed by the Legend of Alcestis; but we
find him suddenly desisting from his task without completing his ninth
Legend, that of Hypermnestra. For this we may reasonably assign two causes;
he was probably already somewhat weary of his self-imposed task, and he
also began to see his way to a still grander collection, on a larger scale.
It is important to observe that Chaucer was, throughout life, haunted by
great ideas; and especially, by the desire to leave behind him at least
some one great work which would attract general attention. Thus it was that
he attempted a translation of the huge French poem of Le Roman de La Rose,
which he probably never finished, though we do not know how far he
proceeded. He planned the poem of Troilus and Criseyde, which terminates
rather suddenly, but not until it had extended to the great length of more
than eight thousand lines. Next he planned the House of Fame, which was to
be largely a work of imagination; but here once more he was dissatisfied,
and abandoned it whilst still incomplete. Almost at once he took up the
Legend of Good Women, with its Prologue and twenty stories, but again
abandoned it for a larger scheme. It is also tolerably clear that the
Monkes Tale originally took its rise from a similar desire to write a
succession of lives of illustrious men; and that the first conception of
this idea preceded that of the Canterbury Tales. We thus see our author
constantly striving after the endeavour to produce some great original
work; and the Canterbury Tales was, in fact, the result of the latest and
greatest of these endeavours.

To assign any exact date for the Man of Lawes Prologue, which mentions
April 18, is difficult. Yet we must exclude 1389, when that day was Easter
Sunday, a day unsuitable for travelling and telling tales; as well as 1390,
when April 17 was Sunday, which would have prevented the pilgrims, at any
rate, from making an early start (Prol. 822-5).

The year 1391 is certainly too late; so that only 1386, 1387, and 1388 are
left for consideration. But in 1386, Easter-day fell on April 22, and Good
Friday on April 20; and we cannot suppose that the pilgrimage could have
taken place in Passion-week, when the Parson and others would be much in
request for the duties which the season imposed upon them.

In 1387 and 1388, however, Easter fell early, and left the pilgrims free to
take a holiday. In 1388, April 18 was a Saturday, so that the pilgrims must
have travelled on Sunday, since they certainly stopped _one_ night on the
road at Ospringe, and probably also stopped elsewhere; and surely, if
Sunday travelling had been intended, something would have been said about
the hearing of mass[78]. But in 1387, everything comes right; they
assembled at the Tabard on Tuesday, April 16, and had four clear days
before them. And when we consider how particular our author is as to dates,
we shall do well to consider the probability that this result is correct.
We should remember, at the same time, that this date is, for other reasons,
more likely than any other. The fact that the Legend of Good Women, begun
in 1385, terminates so suddenly, points to the inception of a still greater
work, probably in 1386; and this leads up to 1387 as the date when the
supposed times assigned to the various Tales were being arranged. And I
still think that we ought to attach _some_ significance to the fact
(pointed out by me in 1868) that the year 1387 suits the scheme of days
mentioned in the Knightes Tale. See note to A 1850, in vol. v.

§ 4. Chaucer tells us, in his Prologue, ll. 791-795, that it was his
intention to make each of the pilgrims tell four tales, two on the way to
Canterbury[79] and two on the return-journey. But so far from fulfilling
his proposed plan, he did not even complete so much as a quarter of it,
since the number of tales do not even suffice to go _once_ round, much less
four times. No pilgrim tells two stories, though the poet represents
himself as being interrupted in his Rime of Sir Thopas, and telling the
tale of Melibeus in its stead; and we have no story from the Yeoman, the
Haberdasher, the Carpenter, the Weaver, the Dyer, the Tapiser, or the
Ploughman[80]. The series being thus incomplete, it only remains to
investigate to what degree of completeness the author succeeded in
attaining.

§ 5. It is easy to see that Chaucer may have had a good deal of material in
hand before the idea of writing a connected series of tales occurred to
him. The Prologue, answering somewhat to a preface, is one of his very
latest works, and in his best manner; and before writing it, he had in some
measure arranged a part of his materials. His design was to make a
collection of tales which he had previously written, to write more new
tales to go with these, and to unite them all into a series by means of
connecting links[81], which should account for the change from one narrator
to the next in order. In doing this, he did not work continuously, but
inserted the connecting links as they occurred to him, being probably well
aware that this was the best way of avoiding an appearance of
artificiality. The result is that some links are perfectly supplied, and
others not written at all, thus affording a series of fragments or
_Groups_, complete in themselves, but having gaps between them. A full
account of these Groups, showing which tales are inseparably linked
together, and which are not joined at all, is given in Dr. Furnivall's
Temporary Preface to the Six-text Edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales,
published for the Chaucer Society in 1868. The resulting Groups are _nine_.
Between these are distinct gaps, and it is by no means clear that the order
of the Groups relatively to each other was finally determined upon. This
relative order is, however, settled to some extent by occasional references
to places passed on the road, and to times of the day. We are also
perfectly certain that the Knight was to tell the first tale, and the
Parson the last of the whole or partial series, thus leaving us only seven
Groups to arrange. Another question at once arises, however, which must be
settled before we can proceed, viz. whether the pilgrimage was intended to
be performed all in one day, or in two, or three, or more. Any one who
knows what travelling was in the olden time must be well aware that the
notion of performing the whole distance in one day is out of the question,
especially as the pilgrims were out more for a holiday than for business,
that some of them were but poorly mounted (Prol. 287, 541), and some of
them but poor riders (Prol. 390, 469, 622)[82]. In fact, such an idea is
purely modern, adopted from thoughtlessness almost as a matter of course by
many modern readers, but certainly not founded upon truth. Fortunately,
too, the matter is put beyond argument by some incidental remarks. In the
first Group, or Group A (l. 3906), occurs the line--

 'Lo Depeford, and it is _half-way pryme_'--

i.e. it is now half-past seven o'clock. After which the Reve is made to
tell a story, and the Cook also, bringing the time of day to about nine
o'clock at the least. But in Group F, l. 73, the Squire remarks that 'it is
pryme,' it is nine o'clock, which can only mean that hour of _another_ day,
not of the same one. Still clearer is the allusion, in the Canon's Yeoman's
Prologue (G 588), to the pilgrims having passed the night in a hostelry, as
I understand the passage. This once perceived, it is not of much
consequence whether we allow the pilgrims two days, or three, or four; but
the most convenient arrangement is that proposed by Mr. Furnivall, viz. to
suppose four days (or three and a half) to have been occupied; the more so,
as this supposition disposes of another extremely awkward allusion to time,
viz. the mention of ten o'clock in the morning in Group B, l. 14, which
must refer to yet a _third_ morning, in order not to clash with the two
notes of time already alluded to; whilst the passage in the Canon's
Yeoman's Prologue absolutely requires a _fourth_ morning, because of the
pilgrims having passed the night at a hostelry. The references to places on
the road can cause no trouble; on the contrary, these allusions afford much
help, for we cannot rest satisfied with the arrangement in Tyrwhitt's
edition, which makes the pilgrims come to Sittingbourne before arriving at
Rochester.

§ 6. But the data are not yet all disposed of: for we can fix the very days
of the month on which the pilgrims travelled. This is discussed in the note
to B 5[83], where the day recognised by the Host is shown to have been the
18th of April, and not the 28th, as in some editions; which agrees with the
expression in the Prologue, l. 8[84].

Putting all the results together, we get the following convenient scheme
for the Groups of tales. It is copied from Dr. Furnivall's Preface, with
the mere addition of the dates.

_April 16._ The guests arrive at the Tabard, late in the evening (Prol. 20,
23).

_April 17._ GROUP A. General Prologue; Knight's Tale; Miller's Prologue and
Tale; Reeve's Prologue and Tale; Cook's Prologue and Tale (the last
unfinished). _Gap._

_Notes of time and place._ In the Miller's Prologue, he tells the company
to lay the blame on the ale of Southwark if his tale is not to their
liking; he had hardly yet recovered from its effects.

In the Reeve's Prologue, A 3906, 3907, are the lines--

 'Lo Depeford, and it is half-way pryme;
  Lo Grenewich, ther many a shrewe is inne.'

That is, they are in sight of Deptford and Greenwich at about half-past 7
o'clock in the morning.

This Group is incomplete; I shall give my reasons presently for supposing
that the Yeoman's Tale was to have formed a part of it. Probably the
pilgrims reached Dartford that night, and halted there, at a distance of
fifteen miles from London.

_April 18._ GROUP B. Man-of-Law Head-link, his Prologue, and Tale (1-1162);
Shipman's Prologue and Tale (1163-1624); Shipman End-link (1625-1642);
Prioress's Tale (1643-1880); Prioress End-link (1881-1901); Sir Thopas
(1902-2156); Tale of Melibeus (2157-3078); Monk's Prologue and Tale
(3079-3956); Nun's Priest's Prologue and Tale (3957-4636); End-link
(4637-4652). _Gap._

_Notes of time and place._ In the Man-of-Law Head-link, we learn that it
was 10 o'clock (l. 14), and that it was the 18th of April (l. 5). In the
Monk's Prologue, l. 3116, we find that the pilgrims were soon coming to
Rochester. This Group is probably incomplete, rather at the beginning than
at the end. Something is wanted to bring the time to 10 o'clock, whilst the
travellers would hardly have cared to pass Rochester that night. Suppose
them to have halted there, at thirty miles from London.

_April 19._ GROUP C. Doctor's Tale (1-286); Words of the Host to the Doctor
and the Pardoner (287-328); Pardoner's Preamble, Prologue, and Tale
(329-968). _Gap._

GROUP D. Wife of Bath's Preamble (1-856); Wife's Tale (857-1264); Friar's
Prologue and Tale (1265-1664); Sompnour's Prologue and Tale (1665-2294).
_Gap._

GROUP E. Clerk's Prologue and Tale (1-1212); Merchant's Prologue and Tale
(1213-2418); Merchant End-link (2419-2440). _Gap; but the break is less
marked than usual._

_Notes of place, &c._ At the end of the Wife of Bath's Preamble is narrated
a verbal quarrel between the Sompnour and the Friar, in which the former
promises to tell some strange tales about friars before the company shall
arrive at Sittingbourne. Again, at the end of his Tale, he says--

 'My tale is doon, we been almost at toune.'--D 2294.

After which, we may suppose the company to have halted awhile at
Sittingbourne, forty miles from London.

It must also be noted that there are at least two allusions to the Wife of
Bath's Preamble in the course of Group E; namely, in the Clerk's Tale, l.
1170, and in the Merchant's Tale, E 1685; and probably a third allusion in
the Merchant End-link, E 2438. These prove that Group D should precede
Group E, and suggest that it should precede it _immediately_.

_April 20._ GROUP F. Squire's Tale (1-672); Squire-Franklin Link (673-708);
Franklin's Tale (709-1624). _Gap._

GROUP G. Second Nun's Tale (1-553); Canon's Yeoman's Tale (554-1481).
_Gap._

GROUP H. Manciple's Prologue and Tale (1-362). _Gap._

GROUP I. Parson's Prologue and Tale.

_Notes of time and place._ In the Squire's Tale, F 73, the narrator remarks
that he will not delay the hearers, 'for it is prime,' i.e. 9 a.m.

In the Canon's Yeoman's Prologue (G 588) is a most explicit statement,
which is certainly most easily understood as having reference to a halt for
the night on the road, at a place (probably Ospringe) five miles short of
Boughton-under-Blee (G 555). The Canon's Yeoman says plainly that he had
seen the pilgrims ride out of their hostelry in the morrow-tide. In the
Manciple's Prologue (H 2) there is mention of a little town called
Bob-up-and-down, 'under the Blee, in Canterbury way'; and the Cook is taken
to task for sleeping on the road in the morning (H 16), which cannot, in
any case, be the morning of the day on which they started from Southwark.
In the Parson's Prologue (I 5) there is mention of the hour of 4 p.m., and
the Parson undertakes to tell the last tale before the end of the journey.

§ 7. The above account is useful as shewing the exact extent to which
Chaucer had carried out his intention; and at the same time shews what is,
on the whole, the best arrangement of the Tales. This arrangement is not
much affected by the question of the number of days occupied by the
pilgrims on the journey. It possesses, moreover, the great advantage of
stamping upon the whole work its incomplete and fragmentary character. The
arrangement of the Tales in the various MSS. varies considerably, and hence
Tyrwhitt found it necessary in his edition to consider the question of
order, and to do his best to make a satisfactory arrangement. The order
which he finally adopted is easily expressed by using the names already
given to the Groups, only Group B must be subdivided into two parts (_a_)
and (_b_), the first of these containing the Man of Law's Prologue and Tale
only, and the second all the rest of the Tales, &c. in the Group. This
premised, his result is as follows: viz. Groups A, B (_a_), D, E, F, C, B
(_b_), G, H, I. The only two variations between the two lists are easily
explained. In the first place, Group C is entirely independent of all the
rest, and contains no note of time or place, so that it may be placed
anywhere between A and G; in this case therefore the variation is of no
importance[85]. In the other case, however, Tyrwhitt omitted to see that
the parts of Group B are really bound together by the expressions which
occur in them. For, whereas the Man of Law declares in l. 46, Group B--

 'I can right now no _thrifty tale_ seyn,'

the Host, at the beginning of the Shipman's Prologue, l. 1165, is pleased
to give his verdict thus--

 'This _was_ a _thrifty tale_ for the nones,'

and proceeds to ask the Parson for a tale, declaring that 'ye lerned men in
lore,' i.e. the Man of Law and the Parson, know much that is good: whence
it is evident that B (_b_) must be advanced so as to follow B (_a_)
immediately; and the more so, as there is authority for this in MS. Arch.
Seld. B 14 in the Bodleian Library; while many MSS. suggest a similar
arrangement (§ 39). The correctness of this emendation is proved by the
fact that it is necessary for the mention of Rochester in B (_b_) to
precede that of Sittingbourne in D.

It deserves to be mentioned further, that, of the four days supposed to be
consumed on the way, some of them are inadequately provided for. This
furnishes no real objection, because the unwritten tales of the Yeoman,
Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapiser, and Ploughman, would have
helped in some degree to fill up the gaps which have been noticed above.

§ 8. The whole of Group A is so admirably fitted together, and its details
so well worked out, that it may fairly be looked upon as having been
finally revised, as far as it goes; and I am disposed accordingly to look
upon the incomplete Cook's Tale as almost the last portion of his great
work which the poet ever revised in its intended final form. There is, in
this Group A, only one flaw, one that has often been noted, viz. the
mention of _three_ Priests in the Prologue (l. 164), whereas we know that
there was but _one_ Nun's Priest, his name being Sir John. At the same
place there is a notable omission of the character of the Nun, and the two
things together point to the possibility that Chaucer may have drawn her
character in too strong strokes, and have then suddenly determined to
withdraw it, and to substitute a new character at some future time[86]. If
we suppose him to have left the line 'That was hir chapeleyne' unfinished,
it is easy to see how another hand would have put in the words 'and
preestes three' for the mere sake of the rime, without having regard to
reason. We ought to reject those three words as spurious.

§ 9. That Chaucer's work did receive, in some small degree, some
touching-up, is rendered yet more probable by observing how Group A ends.
For here, in several of the MSS., we come upon an additional fragment
which, on the face of it, is not Chaucer's at all, but a work belonging to
a slightly earlier period; I mean the Tale of Gamelyn. Some have supposed,
with great reason, that this tale occurs amongst the rest because it is one
which Chaucer intended to recast, although, as a fact, he did not live to
rewrite a single line of it. This is the more likely because the tale is a
capital one in itself, well worthy of being rewritten even by so great a
poet; indeed, it is well known that the plot of the favourite play known to
us all by the title of As You Like It, was derived from it at second-hand.
But I cannot but protest against the stupidity of the botcher whose hand
wrote above it 'The Cokes Tale of Gamelyn.' That was done because it
happened to be found _next after_ the Cook's Tale, which, instead of being
about Gamelyn, is about Perkin the reveller, an idle apprentice.

The fitness of things ought to shew at once that this Tale of Gamelyn, a
tale of the woods, in the true Robin-Hood style, could only have been
placed in the mouth of him 'who bare a mighty bow,' and who knew all the
usage of woodcraft; in one word, of the Yeoman. (_Gandelyn_ is the name of
_an archer_ in Ritson's Ancient Songs, i. 82). And we get hence the
additional hint, that the Yeoman's Tale was to have followed the Cook's
Tale, a tale of fresh country-life succeeding one of the close back-streets
of the city. No better place can be found for it.

§ 10. There is yet one more Tale, found only in the edition of 1542 and
some later printed editions, but in none of the MSS., viz. the Ploughman's
Tale. This is admittedly spurious, in the sense that it is not Chaucer's;
but it is a remarkable poem in its way. The author never intended it for an
imitation of Chaucer, nor pretended any disguise about it; on the contrary,
he says plainly that he was the author of the well-known poem in
alliterative verse commonly known as Pierce the Ploughman's Crede. It can
only have been inserted by inadvertence, but we need not blame the editor
for doing this, since otherwise the poem would not have been preserved at
all, no MS. of it being now in existence.

§ 11. The next question that presents itself is this--Have we any means of
telling which of the Tales are of early, and which of late workmanship? In
reply to this, we may note, in the first place, the following facts and
probabilities.

The Knight's Tale was certainly re-written from beginning to end. In its
original form, Chaucer took a good deal of it from Boccaccio's Teseide, and
gave it the name of 'Palamon and Arcite'; see Prologue to Legend of Good
Women, l. 420; this he would naturally do not long before writing his
Troilus, in which he follows the same author. Moreover, this original
'Palamon' was written in the seven-line stanza; see notes to Anelida.

It must next be noted that Dr. Furnivall, who has drawn up, tentatively, a
list of Chaucer's works in their supposed order, puts down amongst the
works of the 'Second Period,' i.e. prior to the Canterbury Tales, that Tale
which is now known as the Second Nun's, though formerly called by Chaucer
himself the Life of Saint Cecile. Of this result there has never been a
doubt; Tyrwhitt says expressly, 'The Tale of the Nonne is almost literally
translated from the Life of St. Cecilia in the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus
Januensis. It is mentioned by Chaucer as a separate work in his Legend of
Good Women, l. 426, under the title of the Life of Seint Cecile, and it
still retains evident marks that it was not originally composed in the form
of a Tale to be spoken by the Nonne[87].' It is, then, little more than a
translation, and it is in seven-line stanzas.

Dr. Furnivall assigns to the Second Nun's Tale the conjectural date of
1373, being the very year when Chaucer perhaps met Petrarch at Padua (see
note to E 27), and learnt from him the tale of Griseldis, now known as the
Clerk's Tale. This tale is likewise, for the most part, a translation, and
in seven-line stanzas.

The Prioress's Tale is a short one. Although written in seven-line stanzas,
it is probably later than others in the same metre.

The Man of Law's Tale will be considered hereafter; and it will be shewn
that it was written independently of other Tales.

The Monk's Tale is in a very peculiar metre, which appears nowhere else in
Chaucer, except in the unoriginal poem called the ABC (probably written
before A.D. 1369), and in some other of Chaucer's minor poems, such as the
Former Age, Fortune, the Envoy to Bukton, &c.; so that, considered with
reference to metre, this Tale may be of any date. The main part of it shews
very little originality, and is clearly rather early than late.

§ 12. Having premised these considerations, it is easy to see that the
metrical form suggests, to a useful extent, a possible distinction between
the earlier and the later Tales. Nearly all of Chaucer's tales that are in
stanzas are early, whilst all that are in decasyllabic couplets are late.
We have seen that this is known to be true in the case of the Second Nun's
Tale, that it is highly probable in the case of the Clerk's Tale (of which
more hereafter), and there is nothing against it in the case of the Monk's
Tale, written in the same metre as a poem which was probably his very
first, or nearly so, if there be any truth in the statement that it was
written for the use of the Duchess Blanche, who died in 1369. At the same
time, it can be shewn that 'Palamon and Arcite' was written in stanzas, so
that the present metre of the Knight's Tale presents no difficulty. Of
course it will be understood that there is, in these stanza-tales, some of
Chaucer's latest work, but I shall presently shew that this late work is
easily picked out. I have already pointed out that the Prioress's Tale (of
unusual brevity) is an exception to the general rule.

§ 13. The above distinction was suggested to me by the simple _fact_, that
Chaucer cannot be proved to have used his couplets till he was well
advanced in composition. Indeed, it has always been remarked that no
English poet before him ever dreamt of such a metre, and it has been a
source of wonder, for hundreds of years, whence he derived it. To say that
it was derived from the French ten-syllable verse is not a complete
solution of the mystery; for nearly all such verse is commonly either _in
stanzas_, or else _a great number_ of successive lines are rimed together.
We have to discover a specimen of French ten-syllable verse in which _only
two_ successive lines are rimed together; and these, I believe, are very
scarce. After some search I have, however, fortunately lighted upon a very
interesting specimen, among the poems of Guillaume de Machault, a French
writer whom Chaucer is known to have imitated[88], and who died in 1377. In
the edition of Machault's poems edited by Tarbé, Reims and Paris, 1849, p.
89, there is a poem of exactly this character, of no great length, and
fortunately dated; for its title is--'Complainte écrite après la bataille
de Poitiers et avant le siège de Reims par les Anglais' (1356-1358). The
first four lines run thus:--

 'A toy, Henry, dous amis, me complain,
  Pour ce que ne cueur ne mont ne plein[89];
  Car a piet suy, sans cheval et sans selle,
  Et si n'ay mais esmeraude, ne belle.'

The last couplet (the second line of which has two examples of the
fully-sounded final _e_) is as follows:--

 'Et que jamais ne feray chant ne lay,
  Adieu te di: car toutë joië lay.'

As some of Machault's poems seem to have been lost, he may have written
several more poems in the same metre. In any case, we know that Chaucer was
well acquainted with his works, and it is also almost certain that the
earliest attempt to use this metre in English was made by Chaucer, in his
Legend of Good Women, commenced, according to Professor Ten Brink, in the
year 1385 (Furnivall's Trial Forewords, p. 111). Surely this date is one of
considerable importance; for we at once derive from it the probability that
all of the Canterbury Tales written in this metre were written after 1385,
whilst those not in this metre _may_ have been earlier, though one of them
and a part of some others appear to be later.

§ 14. It appears that the original scheme, whereby each pilgrim was to tell
two Tales on the way to Canterbury, and two on his return, was modified, at
the time of writing the Parson's Prologue, to a less ambitious scheme
whereby each pilgrim was to tell but one Tale apiece. Indeed, the
expressions--'Almost fulfild is _al_ myn ordinaunce' in the Parson's
Prologue (I 19), and again--'To knitte up al this feeste, and make an ende'
in the same (I 47), clearly indicate that the author would, by that time,
have been content with the far humbler task of providing but one Tale
apiece for the outward journey _only_. This would have reduced the original
scheme to only a quarter of what had been intended; but even thus far the
work was never completed. All that finally appeared consists of nine
separate fragments; yet they amount to more than 17,000 lines, besides two
Tales in prose. It would have been well if the latest scheme, i.e. the
quarter of the first scheme, could have been thoroughly carried out; but we
must be thankful for what we have.

§ 15. Two attempts were made by subsequent authors to continue the
Canterbury Tales; it may be worth while to give here a brief notice of
them.

The Tale of Beryn, by an anonymous author, belongs to the early part of the
fifteenth century. It has been printed for the Chaucer Society from the
Duke of Northumberland's MS. no. 55, where it occurs at leaf 180, after the
Canon's Yeoman's Tale. This Tale is supposed to have been the first one
told after leaving Canterbury on the return journey, and is put into the
mouth of the Merchant, who volunteers to tell it without troubling the host
to go through the process of casting lots. It is preceded by a Prologue,
which accounts for the manner in which the time was passed in Canterbury. A
considerable portion of it is taken up by an account of an amour of the
Pardoner; but we also learn several particulars which are of interest, as
they refer to the pilgrimage of the characters imagined by Chaucer, and
serve to fill in the general idea.

Following this guide, we learn that, on arriving at Canterbury, the
Pilgrims lodged at an inn called 'The Cheker of the Hope,' or Chequer of
the Hoop; and as soon as they had taken up their quarters there, proceeded
to the cathedral, headed by the Knight, to make their offerings at the
shrine, of silver brooches and the like. On arriving at the door, the
question of precedence arose, as to which should first enter; but this was
settled by the Knight, who gave way to 'the prelatis, the person and his
fere[90].' Hereupon a monk appears, who sprinkles the company with holy
water; and we find that the Friar was very anxious to be allowed to perform
this duty for him--'so longid his holy conscience to se the Nonnys face.'
The Knight and others repair to the shrine, but the Pardoner and the
Miller, with others of like mind, chiefly occupy themselves with wandering
about the cathedral, poring upon the stained glass in the windows, and
discussing the coats-of-arms there displayed, as well as the chief subjects
there depicted. However, the Host goes after them, and persuades them to
visit the shrine, and pay their offerings. After kneeling down before the
shrine, and kissing the various relics, they stay to hear the service, and
afterwards repair to the inn to dinner, as it is now near noon.

On their way, they buy, according to custom, some pilgrims' 'signs' or
tokens; on which occasion the Miller and Pardoner obtain several
'Canterbury brooches' by the cheap process of stealing them. They
afterwards display the signs, as usual, by wearing them stuck in their
hats.

On returning to the inn, they wash and sit down to dinner, and are soon in
loud talk, greatly enjoying themselves. The Host then formally thanks the
company for having, each of them, told 'a tale' according to the original
compact[91]. All that is now required, he says, is 'that wee must so,
homward, eche man tel anothir.' The Friar reminds the Host that they were
all to sup with him on their return to Southwark (Prol. 799, 815). The Host
says he is ready to do his part, and the company disperse for a time. They
again meet at supper; and afterwards go to bed for the night.

The next morning, the Knight and his son the Squire each 'cast on a
fressher gown,' an example followed by several others, and all sally out to
see the town. The Knight and Squire are particularly interested in the
town-walls and the fortifications, which they examine critically, though
the Squire's mind is occasionally distracted by irrepressible thoughts of
his lady-love. The Clerk of Oxford harangues the Sompnour, and tells him
that he ought not to be angry with the Friar for knowing so much about
evil-doings, and for telling a Tale about a false Sompnour; for it is well
to have some knowledge both of good and evil, and it is admitted that there
must always be some evil members of every calling; of which doctrine the
Knight approves. The Monk takes the Parson and the Grey Friar[92] to call
on a friend of his; and we are told that they did not drink water together
on this occasion; 'for spycys and eke wyne Went round aboute.' The Wife of
Bath and the Prioress repair to the garden behind the inn, which they
greatly admire; whilst the Merchant, the Manciple, the Miller, the Reeve,
and others roam about the town. In the evening, all the pilgrims meet at
supper-time, after which the steadier members of the company go early to
bed, whilst the Miller and the Cook sit up drinking. Here follows, at
considerable length, the adventure of the Pardoner. Next morning, the whole
company leave Canterbury early, in splendid weather, and are all in
excellent spirits. The tale-telling commences, and the Merchant undertakes
to tell the Tale of Beryn.

§ 16. The other projected continuation of the Canterbury Tales is Lydgate's
poem called the Storie of Thebes, first printed as an appendix to the Tales
in Stowe's edition of 1561[93]. It is preceded by a Prologue in which
Lydgate, with some humour, makes the Host remark that the poet's bridle has
neither boss nor bell, and that the poet himself is pale, and 'all deuoide
of blood', and wears upon his head 'a wonder thredbare hood', being
moreover 'Well araied for to ride late'; which I take to mean that, if his
late riding caused him to fall among thieves, there was not much spoil to
be obtained from him.

Lydgate had, he tells us, just recovered from a sickness, and went on a
pilgrimage to Canterbury on his own account. By good fortune, he went to
the same inn as Chaucer's pilgrims, and found there the whole company. The
Host invites him to supper, offering him a great pudding or a round haggis,
and prescribing for him, after supper, some red fennel, anise, cummin, or
coriander-seed. The pilgrims are to leave Canterbury next morning at
daybreak, and Lydgate agrees to accompany them.

Accordingly, on the morrow, they make an early start, designing to reach
Ospringe by dinner-time, i.e. by about ten o'clock in the forenoon. They
had only just left the precincts of the town, when the Host calls upon
Lydgate to tell the first Tale of the day; whereupon he commences the long
'Storie of Thebes', in three parts. He succeeded in finishing the first
part just at nine o'clock, as they 'passed the thrope[94] of Broughton on
the Blee'. Near the end of the third part there is an interesting allusion
to the opening lines of the Knightes Tale, where the mourning ladies await
the coming of Theseus--

 'And, as my master Chaucer list to endite,
  All clad in blacke with hir wimples white'--

take up their position 'in the temple of the goddesse Clemence.' When
Theseus comes, they beseech him to redress their harms:--

 'But if ye list to see the gentillesse
  Of Theseus, and how he hath him borne,
  If ye remember, ye[95] have heard to-forne
  Well rehearsed, at Depeford in the vale,
  In the beginning of the Knightes tale.'

It should be particularly noted that, like the author of the Tale of Beryn,
Lydgate assumes that each pilgrim tells _one_ Tale only on the journey to
Canterbury, and _one_ on the way home. The Host explains to him that it is
'the custome of this companie' for each member of it 'To tell a tale,' and
that they 'will homeward the same custome vse.' It is clear that Chaucer's
theory about the scheme of his Tales was entirely lost sight of, and that
only his practice was regarded, which implied that half the number would
suffice. Tyrwhitt's proposal, to alter the text of the Prologue so as to
make it square better with the facts, contradicts all that we know about
Chaucer. To formulate larger schemes than he could carry out was his
constant habit.


GROUP A.

§ 17. The Prologue is chiefly occupied with the description of the company.
As to their number, there is a little difficulty. In l. 24, we are told
that it was 'wel nyne and twenty,' i.e. about 29. The question as to
whether this number includes Chaucer himself seems to be settled by l. 29,
where he employs the word 'we'; and we shall find that to include the poet
among the 29 suits best with all that is said about them; cf. l. 544.
Nevertheless, the actual number described (if we include Chaucer) is 31,
owing to the mention of 'the preestes three' in l. 164. This has been
commented on in § 8; and, as we have the authority of Chaucer himself for
supposing that one of the tellers of Tales is the Nonnes Preest, which
presupposes but _one_ Preest, we are justified in looking upon these three
words as having been interpolated. We might even suppose that Chaucer
himself made such an alteration himself at a later time, forgetting the
inconsistency which was thus introduced. I shall now assume the truth of
this correction, and give the list of the 29. At the same time, I print _in
italics_ the names of those who are tellers of Tales, and we thus see the
result at a glance.

1. _The Knight._ 2. _The Squyer._ 3. The Yeman. 4. _The Prioresse._ 5. _The
Second Nonne._ 6. _The Nonnes Preest._ 7. _The Monk._ 8. _The Frere._ 9.
_The Marchaunt._ 10. _The Clerk._ 11. _The Sergeant of the Lawe,_ or _Man
of Lawe._ 12. _The Frankeleyn._ 13. The Haberdasher. 14. The Carpenter. 15.
The Webbe. 16. The Dyere. 17. The Tapicer. 18. _The Cook._ 19. _The
Shipman._ 20. _The Doctour_, or _Phisicien._ 21. _The Wyf of Bathe._ 22.
_The Persoun._ 23. The Plowman. 24. _The Miller._ 25. _The Manciple._ 26.
_The Reve._ 27. _The Somnour._ 28. _The Pardoner._ 29. _Chaucer._ Besides
these, we find (ll. 803, 4) that mine Host of the Tabard, by name Harry
Bailly (A 4358), volunteered to accompany and guide the pilgrims, thus
bringing their total number up to _thirty_. To which it is very necessary
to add, that the number of pilgrims was increased, during the journey, by
the accession of the _Chanouns Yeman_ (G 703).

The Host proposes that each pilgrim shall tell two Tales on the outward,
and two on the homeward journey; a proposal which afterwards dwindled down,
as explained above, to _one_ only, on the outward journey alone. Even this
scheme was not fulfilled, nor did the pilgrims ever arrive at their
destination. We only know that the Persones Tale was to have been the last,
as the Knightes was the first. The best tale-teller, in the judgment of
mine host, was to have a supper in his honour, at the expense of all the
rest; but the prize was never awarded.

Chaucer's description of his characters is dramatic and masterly; and
nothing more need be said about them here, though some further particulars
are given in the Notes[96]. His sketches are doubtless original, with the
remarkable exception of certain lines in the descriptions of the Prioresse
and the Wyf of Bathe, which are transcribed or imitated from Le Roman de la
Rose. We even find in Marsh (Eng. Language, p. 419) the remark, that
Chaucer was 'a dramatist before that which is technically known as the
drama was invented.'

§ 18. THE KNIGHTES TALE. It is certain that this poem was rewritten, for
the purpose of being placed at the head of the Tales. In its original form,
it constituted the poem of 'Palemon and Arcite' as referred to in the
Legend of Good Women; see the note to l. 420 of that poem, and the
introductory remarks to Anelida and Arcite in vol. i. p. 529. We thus see
(as was duly noted by Ten Brink[97]) that the original Palemon and Arcite
was written in seven-line stanzas, and that some fragments that once
belonged to it have found their way into other poems. The opening stanzas
of Palemon and Arcite are preserved in the poem of Anelida, ll. 22-46; and
we can easily see how they were rewritten so as to form ll. A 859-873 of
the Knightes Tale. Above Anelida, l. 22, and again above A 859, the same
quotation from Statius is still found in the MSS.

Sixteen stanzas which probably belonged to Palemon and Arcite are preserved
in the Parl. Foules, 183-294. These lines were entirely recast and
condensed, with additions of Chaucer's own, and answer to Kn. Ta., A
1918-1935. The likeness is so slight that it is worth while to shew wherein
it consists. I quote first from the Parl. Foules, and afterwards from the
Knightes Tale, merely giving such lines as shew a faint likeness, and
printing unchanged words in italics.

(1) From the PARLIAMENT OF FOULES:--

  246. _Within the temple_ [sc. of Venus], of _syghes_ hote as _fyr_
       I herde a swogh that ganne aboute renne;
       Which _syghes_ were engendred _with desyr_....
  218. Tho was I war of _Plesaunce_ anon-right,
  225. I saw _Beautee_, withouten any atyr,
       _And Youthe_, ful of game and Iolitee
       _Fool-hardinesse_, _Flaterye_, and _Desyr_,
       Messagerye, and Mede, and othere three....
  261. Fond I Venus and her porter _Richesse_.
  221. To doon by _force_ a wight to do folye.
  252. ... the bitter goddesse _Ialousye_.
  197. Of _instruments_ of strenges....
  232. Aboute the temple _daunceden_ alway....
  219. And of _Aray, and Lust_.

(2) From the KNIGHTES TALE: A 1918, &c.:--

  First _in the temple_ of Venus maystow see....
  The broken slepes and the _sykes_ colde....
  The _fyry_ strokes of _the desiring_....
  _Plesaunce_ and hope, _desyr_, _fool-hardinesse_,
  _Beautee_ _and youthe_, bauderie, _richesse_,
  Charmes and _force_, lesinges, _flaterye_,
  Dispense, bisynesse, and _Ielousye_....
  Festes, _instruments_, caroles, _daunces_,
  _Lust and array_.

The above is an excellent example of the manner in which Chaucer was
capable of absorbing ideas, and reproducing them in a form almost wholly
his own. If we were not aware beforehand that both these passages are due
to stanzas 53-64 of Book VII. of Boccaccio's Teseide, it would be easy to
miss even their general resemblance.

Lastly, we find that the lines in Troilus, v. 1807-27, are really imitated
from the Teseide, xi. stt. 1-3, where they refer to the death of Arcite. In
the Knightes Tale, all that answers to the same passage is a part of lines
A 2809-15; and all the resemblance is in the following expressions.

(1) From TROILUS, v. 1808, &c.:--

  His lighte goost ful blisfully is went
  Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere....
  And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,
  Theras Mercurie sorted him to dwelle.

(2) From the KNIGHTES TALE; A 2809:--

  His spirit chaunged hous, and wente ther,
  As I cam never, I can nat tellen wher....
                      ... wher they dwelle;
  Arcite is cold, ther Mars his soule gye.

The change from _Mercury_, as the conductor of souls in general, to _Mars_,
as the conductor of the martial soul of Arcite, is well worth notice.

§ 19. These specimens furnish good examples of Chaucer's method. Palemon
and Arcite was, at first, a reasonably close imitation of Boccaccio's poem
of the Teseide, which took its name from the hero Theseus. But in its
second form, it was so much altered as to become, to all intents, a truly
original poem. Thanks to the patient labour of Mr. Henry Ward, who collated
the Teseide and the Knightes Tale throughout, line by line, we can now tell
that 'out of 2250 of Chaucer's lines, he has only translated 270 (less than
one-eighth); that only 374 more lines bear a general likeness to
Boccaccio's, and only 132 more, a slight likeness; [so that] any talk of
the Knightes Tale being a "translation only," or "taken bodily from the
Teseide" (of 9054 lines), is of course absurd. Chaucer's work is an
_adaptation_ of his original.'--F. J. Furnivall, A Temporary Preface of the
Six-text Edition of the Canterbury Tales, p. 104.

A table shewing the general resemblance between certain lines in the
Knightes Tale and lines in the Teseide, is given in the Notes; to which I
must refer the reader for further information. I will merely add here that
Chaucer also consulted the Thebais of Statius, which was one of Boccaccio's
authorities.

§ 20. In order to give a clear idea of the general contents of Boccaccio's
poem, I here quote in full the analysis of it made by Tyrwhitt, and printed
in his Introductory Discourse:--

'The Teseide is distributed into twelve Books or Cantoes.

'Bk. i. Contains the war of Theseus with the Amazons, their submission to
him, and his marriage with Hippolyta.

'Bk. ii. Theseus, having spent two years in Scythia, is reproached by
Perithous in a vision, and immediately returns to Athens with Hippolyta and
her sister Emilia. He enters the city in triumph; finds the Grecian ladies
in the temple of Clemenzia; marches to Thebes; kills Creon, &c., and brings
home Palemone and Arcita who are "Damnati--ad eterna presone."

'Bk. iii. Emilia, walking in a garden and singing, is heard and seen first
by Arcita[98], who calls Palemone. They are both equally enamoured of her,
but without any jealousy or rivalship. Emilia is supposed to see them at
the window, and to be not displeased with their admiration. Arcita is
released at the request of Perithous; takes his leave of Palemone, with
embraces, &c.

'Bk. iv. Arcita, having changed his name to _Pentheo_, goes into the
service of Menelaus at Mycenae, and afterwards of Peleus at Aegina. From
thence he returns to Athens and becomes a *favourite servant of Theseus,
being known to Emilia, though to nobody else; till after some time he is
overheard making his complaint in a wood, to which he usually resorted for
that purpose, by Pamphilo, a servant of Palemone.

'Bk. v. Upon the report of Pamphilo, Palemone _begins_ to be jealous of
Arcita, and is desirous to get out of prison in order to fight with him.
This he accomplishes with the assistance of Pamphilo, by changing clothes
with Alimeto, a physician. He goes armed to the wood in quest of Arcita,
whom he finds sleeping. At first, they are very civil and friendly to each
other. Then Palemone calls upon Arcita to renounce his pretensions to
Emilia, or to fight with him. After many long expostulations on the part of
Arcita, they fight, and are discovered first by Emilia, who sends for
Theseus. When he finds who they are, and the cause of their difference, he
forgives them, and proposes the method of deciding their claim to Emilia by
a combat of a hundred on each side, to which they gladly agree.

'Bk. vi. Palemone and Arcita live splendidly at Athens, and send out
messengers to summon their friends, who arrive; and the principal of them
are severally described, viz. Lycurgus, Peleus, Phocus, Telamon, &c.;
Agamemnon, Menelaus, Castor and Pollux, &c.; Nestor, Evander, Perithous,
Ulysses, Diomedes, &c.; with a great display of ancient history and
mythology.

'Bk. vii. Theseus declares the laws of the combat, and the two parties of a
hundred on each side are formed. The day before the combat, Arcita, after
having visited the temples of all the gods, makes a formal prayer to Mars.
The prayer, _being personified_, is said to go and find Mars in his temple
in Thrace, which is described; and Mars, upon understanding the message,
causes favourable signs to be given to Arcita. In the same manner Palemone
closes his religious observances with a prayer to Venus. His prayer, _being
also personified_, sets out for the temple of Venus on Mount Citherone,
which is also described; and the petition is granted. Then the sacrifice of
Emilia to Diana is described, her prayer, the appearance of the goddess,
and the signs of the two fires. In the morning they proceed to the theatre
with their respective troops and prepare for the action. Arcita puts up a
private prayer to Emilia, and harangues his troop publickly; and Palemone
does the same.

'Bk. viii. Contains a description of the battle, in which Palemone is taken
prisoner.

'Bk. ix. The horse of Arcita, being frighted by a Fury, sent from Hell at
the desire of Venus, throws him. However, he is carried to Athens in a
triumphal chariot with Emilia by his side; is put to bed dangerously ill;
and there by his own desire espouses Emilia.

'Bk. x. The funeral of the persons killed in the combat. Arcita, being
given over by his physicians, makes his will, in discourse with Theseus,
and desires that Palemone may inherit all his possessions and also Emilia.
He then takes leave of Palemone and Emilia, to whom he repeats the same
request. Their lamentations. Arcita orders a sacrifice to Mercury, which
Palemone performs for him, and dies.

'Bk. xi. Opens with the passage of Arcita's soul to heaven, imitated from
the Ninth Book of Lucan. The funeral of Arcita. Description of the wood
felled takes up six stanzas. Palemone builds a temple in honour of him, in
which his whole history is painted. The description of this painting is an
abridgement of the preceding part of the Poem.

'Bk. xii. Theseus proposes to carry into execution Arcita's will by the
marriage of Palemone and Emilia. This they both decline for some time in
formal speeches, but at last are persuaded and married. The kings, &c. take
their leave, and Palemone remains--in gioia e in diporto con la sua dona
nobile e cortese.'

§ 21. It is remarkable how many expressions that occur in the Knightes Tale
are repeated from Troilus. Examples are: A 925, from Tr. iv. 2; A 1010,
from Tr. iv. 627; A 1101, from Tr. i. 425; 1133, cf. Tr. i. 674; 1155, cf.
Tr. v. 332; 1163, cf. Tr. iv. 618; 1401, from Tr. iv. 865; 1500, from Tr.
ii. 112; 1509, from Tr. ii. 920; 1566, from Tr. iii. 733; 1838, from Tr. v.
1433; 2449, from Tr. iv. 1456. Besides this, l. 301 of the Prologue is from
Tr. iv. 1174. This tends to shew that the Knightes Tale (rather than the
original Palamon and Arcite) was written not very long after Troilus;
rather in 1386 or 1387 than in 1388.

I also note that ll. 1035-6, 1196, and 1502, are echoes of ll. 2425-6,
2282, and 1204, of the Legend of Good Women.

§ 22. An early play called 'Palamon and Arcite,' by Richard Edwards, was
produced at Oxford in 1566 before Queen Elizabeth; and Henslowe mentions a
play with the same name in 1594. Hence also the play of 'The Two Noble
Kinsmen,' printed in 1634, with a title-page in which it was attributed to
Shakespeare and Fletcher; see my edition, published for the Cambridge
University Press in 1875. Dryden's fine poem of Palamon and Arcite is well
known; we need not compare it with Chaucer's work very closely. Though
inferior to the original, it has a certain excellence of its own. A
modernisation of the Knightes Tale by Lord Thurlow appeared in 1822;
concerning which nothing need be said. For further remarks on this Tale,
consult Warton, History of Eng. Poetry, sect. xii, who, by the way,
characterises the description of Lycurgus as being 'very great in the
gothic style of painting'; where it is charitable to suppose that by
'gothic' he meant 'English,' but lacked the courage to use the word. And
see Morley, Eng. Writers, v. 312; Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer; an essay
by Dr. J. Koch, in Essays on Chaucer, p. 359 (Chaucer Society); and remarks
by Ten Brink, in his Chaucer Studien, p. 62, and Geschichte der englischen
Litteratur, book v.

We may observe that Chaucer has evidently assigned the first place to the
Knightes Tale, as being, in his own opinion, the best. It was probably
intended that the Knight, the most worshipful person in the company, should
succeed in 'winning the supper.'

§ 23. THE MILLER'S PROLOGUE. The Knightes Tale ended, the Host calls upon
the Monk to tell the second Tale; but the drunken Miller, notwithstanding
the fact that he is perfectly aware of his condition, churlishly insists on
telling a Tale to the grave discredit of a Carpenter. This announcement is
resented, somewhat strangely, not by the Carpenter who is expressly named
as being among the pilgrims (Prol. 361), but by the Reeve, who had learnt a
carpenter's trade in his youth (Prol. 614). But remonstrance is vain, and
the Miller proceeds. Chaucer is careful to advise those who object to a
coarse story to 'turne over the leef; and he has good reason for giving the
hint.

§ 24. THE MILLERES TALE. 'When,' says Tyrwhitt, 'the Knight has finished
his Tale, the Host with great propriety calls upon the Monk, as the next in
rank among the men, to tell the next Tale; but as it seems to have been the
intention of Chaucer to avail himself of the variety of his characters, in
order to distribute alternate successions of serious and comic, in nearly
equal proportions, throughout his work, he has contrived that the _Hostes_
arrangement shall be set aside by the intrusion of the drunken Miller,
whose Tale is such as might be expected from his character and condition, a
complete contrast to the _Knightes_.'

No early Tale resembling this has yet been pointed out. Nevertheless, it is
not likely that the main details were of Chaucer's own invention, as clear
traces of the same story have been found in Germany. This was pointed out
by R. Köhler, of Weimar, in Anglia, vol. i. p. 38; who gives a summary of a
very similar story occurring in a book entitled Nachtbüchlein, by Valentin
Schumann, which appeared in 1559. At the beginning of the first Part of
this work is a tale entitled: 'Ein andere Hystoria von einem Kauffmann der
forcht sich vor dem Jüngsten Tage,' or the Tale of a Merchant who dreaded
the advent of the Last Day.

The latter part of the story, about Absolon and Nicholas, occurs (says
Köhler) in an Italian novel, viz. in novel no. 49 in the collection by
Massuccio di Salerno, who flourished about 1470; see chap. viii. of
Dunlop's Hist. of Fiction. It is also found, as he further tells us, in a
carnival-play by Hanz Folz (in Keller, i. 330).

Another German version similar to that in the Nachtbüchlein, is found in a
modern collection entitled 'Sagen, Märchen, und Lieder der Herzogtümer
Schleswig-Holstein und Lauenburg,' Kiel, 1845, p. 589 (Anglia, i. 186).

A third German version occurs in a book of the 17th century, entitled
'Lyrum Larum, seu Nugae Venales Ioco Seriae'; see Anglia, ii. 135.

Some have imagined a resemblance between this Tale and one in Boccaccio's
Decamerone, Day 3, Nov. 4; but it is a very remote one, so that the
reference is practically worthless.

Chaucer's story reappears in an English imitation of it, very briefly told
in prose, in a book entitled 'The Life and Death of the merry Deuill of
Edmonton, with the pleasaunt prancks of Smug the Smith, &c. By T[homas]
B[rewer]. Printed by T. P. for F. Faulkner; 1631.' The chapter is headed:
'How Smug was reuenged upon a Barber (his riuall) that made him kisse his
tayle.' The story is reprinted in full by L. Proescholdt, of Homburg, in
Anglia, vii. 117.

Lounsbury, in his Studies of Chaucer, iii. 89, mentions a worthless book by
Richard Braithwaite, dated 1665, called 'A Comment upon the Two Tales of
our ancient, renowned, and ever-living poet, Sir Jeffray Chaucer, Knight.'
The 'Two Tales' are those of the Miller and the Wife of Bath. From the same
work (iii. 188) we learn that Samuel Cobb published a modernised version of
the Tale in 1712, which adheres rather closely to the original, but is of
no value.

§ 25. THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE. Oswold, the Reeve, being by trade a carpenter,
is somewhat offended by the Miller's discourse; and, after a little moral
talk, which the Host speedily cuts short, undertakes to tell a similar Tale
to the discredit of a miller; and certainly succeeds in requiting him in
kind. Chaucer's former hint, to turn over the leaf (A 3183), may be applied
to this Tale also. But no such hint is given.

§ 26. THE REVES TALE. This story resembles one which occurs in Boccaccio's
Decamerone, Day 9, Nov. 6; but this only proves that both are derived from
a common source[99]. A closer resemblance to Chaucer's story, as pointed
out by Mr. T. Wright, occurs in a French Fabliau found in MS. Berne, no.
354, fol. 164, back. It was first printed in Wright's Anecdota Litteraria,
p. 15, and is reprinted in Originals and Analogues, p. 93 (Chaucer
Society). We find in it very similar incidents. Two clerks take a sack of
wheat to a mill to be ground. They throw down the sack on the mill-floor,
and turn their mare loose in a meadow. One of them stays to watch the sack,
whilst the other seeks the miller, who is in a neighbouring wood. The first
clerk grows tired of waiting, and goes after the other. Meanwhile, the
miller returns, and secretes the sack. The clerks, returning, can find
neither sack nor mare. At last they ask the miller to take them in for the
night. The story proceeds nearly as in Chaucer; and, in the sequel, the
clerks regain both wheat and mare, and take the wheat to be ground
elsewhere. Perhaps it is needless to add that Chaucer's Tale is none the
less original. His mode of telling it is such as to render it wholly his
own.

Another story, of a similar cast, occurs in another French Fabliau, by Jean
de Boves, entitled De Gombert et des Deux Clers. It is printed in Méon's
edition of Barbazan's Fabliaux et Contes, vol. iii. pp. 239-44, Paris,
1808; and is reprinted, from two MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale de
Paris (nos. 837, 2168), in Originals and Analogues, p. 87 (Chaucer
Society). This story is less complete, as it omits all the former part,
about taking the wheat to be ground. Two clerks seek lodging with a
_vilain_, named Gombert; one of them falls in love with Gombert's wife, and
the other, with his daughter. The rest of the story is much the same as
before.

A later version occurs in a black-letter quarto volume printed by Wynkyn de
Worde, entitled 'A mery Iest of the Mylner of Abyngton[100] with his Wyfe
and his Doughter, and the two poore scholers of Cambridge'; reprinted in
Hazlitt's Early Popular Poetry, iii. 98. I do not agree with Hazlitt's
opinion that this story has 'little or nothing in common' with the Reves
Tale; on the contrary, I should say that the author took his story from
Chaucer, as is tolerably obvious from the mention of Cambridge, but took
some pains to disguise its origin. Although he alters Trumpington to
Abington, many particulars are closely copied, as, e.g. the precise manner
in which the two clerks watch the grinding of the wheat, one from above,
and one from below. I equally dissent from Hazlitt's other opinion, that,
'in an artistic and constructive point of view, the "Mylner of Abyngton" is
superior to its predecessor.' The decisions of some critics are simply
inexplicable.

In the Preface to Dyce's edition of Skelton, vol. i. p. lxvi., there is a
'Merie Tale' of Skelton, entitled 'How Master Skeltons miller deceyued hym
manye times by playinge the theefe,' &c. It illustrates the tricks of
millers, but the story is different.

Besides these, two German versions of the story occur in MSS., and there is
a short Latin version of it in De Generibus Ebriosorum (1516). See an able
discussion of the whole matter in an excellent article by H. Varnhagen,
printed in Englische Studien, vol. ix. pp. 240-266. Varnhagen reprints the
French Fabliau given in Wright's Anecdota Litteraria, but from another MS.,
of the 13th century, found at Berlin. He also reprints the Milner of
Abington, with a better arrangement of the text, shewing its true metrical
form. He then investigates the relationship to one another of all the
various versions, exhibiting the result in a table printed at p. 266.

As to the connexion between Chaucer's Tale and the French Fabliau in the
Berne MS., Varnhagen points out some interesting resemblances, such as the
following:--

  Diu povre clerc furent jadis.--1.
  Than were ther yonge povre clerkes two.--A 4002.
  Né d'une vile et d'un pais.--2.
  Of o toun were they born.--A 4014.
  Il a son conpaignon bouté.--190.
  He poked Iohn.--A 4169.
  Qant il oït lo coc chanter.--257.
  Til that the thridde cok bigan to singe.--A 4233.
  Tantost prant lo clerc par la gole.--288.
  And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn.--A 4273.

§ 27. THE COOK'S PROLOGUE. The Cook heartily approves of the Reves Tale,
and informs the company that his name is Hogge (Hodge) of Ware; at the same
time volunteering a story. The Host approves the offer--

 'Now telle on, Roger; loke that it be good'--

but accuses him of cheating his customers. The Cook replies
good-humouredly, calling the Host by his name, 'Herry Bailly,' and suggests
that he knows a tale not much to the credit of 'an hostileer.' However, he
will not tell that tale now.

§ 28. THE COKES TALE. This Tale, as found in all the MSS., is a mere
fragment, extending to only 58 lines; and this portion is insufficient to
shew the form which the Tale was meant to take. The portrait of Perkin
Revelour, the idle apprentice, is, however, clearly drawn.

It would seem as if this fragment was meant to be suppressed; for, in the
Manciple's Prologue, the Host calls upon the Cook to tell a tale, even if
it be worthless; but the Manciple intercedes, and the Host excuses him,
because he is so helplessly drunk (H 13, 29). This seems to presuppose that
the Cook had told no tale as yet; for, by this time, Chaucer had arrived at
his modified plan, which required only _one_ Tale from each pilgrim on the
outward journey (§ 14); and the Manciple is called upon to tell his own
Tale instead, as he had hitherto told none.

§ 29. THE TALE OF GAMELYN. This Tale is, of course, not Chaucer's, and is
never found in MSS. of the A-type (see Pref. to vol. iv). Perhaps we may
hence infer that MSS. of that type represent the text of the Tales as it
stood before Chaucer's death; whereas, after that event, 'Gamelyn' was
inserted amongst them by scribes or friends who found it amongst the
writings which he had left behind him. We cannot doubt that, if Chaucer had
rewritten this Tale, he would have placed it in the mouth of the Yeman. As,
however, it happens to have been inserted immediately after the Cook's
Tale, a late hand, in the Harl. MS. 7334, has scribbled above it--'The
Cokes Tale of Gamelyn'; whence the blunder arose of connecting it with the
Cook.

As the Tale is found in several of the MSS., I have printed it in the
Appendix to vol. iv., pp. 645-667, in smaller type. The text is mainly from
MS. Harl. 7334, collated with Harl. Cp., Ln., Pt., Rl., and Sl.; see
footnote on p. 645 of vol. iv., and the description of the MSS. in the
Introduction to that volume.

The Tale is evidently of some antiquity, and may be dated, approximately,
about 1340. One line which occurs in it twice over (see ll. 277, 764) is
quoted, almost exactly, from l. 475 of a Poem on the Evil Times of Edward
II., as printed by Mr. Wright for the Camden Society in 1839, the probable
date of which is about 1320.

The dialect is more northern than that of the Canterbury Tales, and
resembles that of Lincolnshire. The proportion of French words is much
smaller: see, e. g., ll. 5-7, 9-13, 16, 20-30, in which no French words
occur. The proportion of Scandinavian words is larger; we may notice _serk_
(Lowl. Sc. _sark_) in l. 259, _skeet_, quickly, in l. 187, which do not
occur in Chaucer. The very name of Gamelyn is of Scandinavian origin,
answering to a form _Gamel-[=i]n_, from the Norse word for 'old,' as seen
in Icel. _gamall_, Swed. _gammal_, Dan. _gammel_. It is perhaps the
original of _Gandeleyn_, which occurs in a ballad entitled 'Robyn and
Gandeleyn,' belonging to the cycle of the Robin Hood ballads (cf. p. 381).
The exploits of Gamelyn remind us somewhat of those of Havelok; in
particular, the marvellous way in which Gamelyn lays about him, at one time
with a 'pestle' (l. 128) and at another with a 'cart-staff' (l. 500),
recalls Havelok's feat in killing twenty men with the bar of a door; see
the Lay of Havelok the Dane, ed. Skeat, ll. 1794-1859. On the whole, we may
fairly connect this Tale with the neighbourhood of Sherwood Forest, to
which so many of the Robin Hood ballads belong; and its considerable
antiquity gives it a peculiar interest.

§ 30. The story evidently belongs to that highly popular class in which it
is the youngest of three brothers who is the successful hero[101]. I should
be inclined to believe that the Tale is not wholly due to the invention of
its author, but is derived, like the Lay of Havelok, from some Anglo-French
original; whilst there are, at the same time, some traces (as in that poem)
of Scandinavian influence. The name Sir Johan of Boundes is French; since
_Boundes_ is the pl. of _bound_, from the Old French _bonne_, a limit; the
equivalent English phrase for 'of Boundes' would be 'of the Marches.' The
name of his second son is Otes (l. 727) or Ote (l. 731), which is the nom.
case of the F. Otoun, from the Lat. Othonem, accusative of Otho (cf. G.
Otto). Otoun is the name of a French knight who was vanquished by Sir Guy
of Warwick.

§ 31. Some of the rimes in this poem are imperfect, as _wit_, _bet_, 111;
whilst _gat-e_, _scap-e_, 575, form a mere assonance. We also find mere
repetitions, such as _now_, _now_, 93; _thee_, _thee_, 399; _another_,
_other_, 445. The rime _thare_, _yare_, 793, is certainly Northern. So also
_ying_, _king_, 887; yet, at l. 169, we find _tonge_, _yonge_, shewing that
the author was not very particular.

The metre is not easy to follow, being very variable; it resembles that of
such popular nursery rimes as 'Sing a song of sixpence,' wherein two
_consecutive_ accents, as in 'And snápped óff her nose,' excite no surprise
or difficulty. Each verse is divided into two parts by a metrical pause,
denoted in this edition by a raised full stop (·). Each part is of variable
length, and may be considered separately. In the former part the chief
varieties conform to the following types, where 'A' denotes an accented
syllable, and 'b' an unaccented one.

(1) A b A b A b; as in l. 12:--

  Hów his chíldren shóld-e.

So also ll. 15, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 49.

(2) b A b A b A; as in l. 71:--

  He toók intó his hónd.

So also ll. 88, 93, 105, 143, 200, 287.

(3) b A b A b A b; as in l. 2:--

  And yé schull' héer' a tálking.

So also ll. 9, 17, 19, 27, 29, 32, 42, 61, 64.

The above half-lines contain _three_ accents; but _four_ accents occur
also, chiefly in the following types.

(4) A b A b A b A; as in l. 120:--

  Gámelýn was wár anón.

So also ll. 123, 135, 139, 252, 280, 282, 306. Also ll. 199, 207, where
_Good-e_ marks the vocative case.

(5) A b A b A b A b; as in l. 34:--

  Bót' of bál-e gód may sénd-e.

So also ll. 118, 336.

(6) b A b A b A b A; as in l. 6:--

  The éldest wás a móche schréw'.

So also ll. 55 (_neyh-e-bours_ having three syllables), 62, 80, 94, 96, 99,
100, 107, 109, 125, 136, 153.

(7) b A b A b A b A b; as in ll. 31, 58:--

  And séyd-e, sír', for góddes lóv-e.
  That wás my fádres héritág-e.

Most of the further variations are caused by the slurring of a slight
syllable which is practically superfluous; or, on the other hand, by the
omission of an unaccented syllable where we should expect to hear one. The
former of these processes is simple and common. Thus, in l. 18, we have:--

  To hélp-e dél_en his_ lóndes,

where the two syllables italicised are run together, and the line is really
of the type no. 3.

It is the other process, viz. the omission of an expected syllable, which
jars so disagreeably on the modern ear; though common (as was said) in
nursery rimes. Thus, in l. 23:--

  On his déth-bédd-e.

In l. 41:--

  Tho léet-e théy the kníght lý-en.

In l. 68:--

  And déyd-e whán tým-e cóm.

These are of the types A b A A b (cf. no. 1); b A b A b A A b (cf. no. 7);
and b A b A A b A (cf. no. 6); and were no doubt considered sufficiently
good. The lilt of the verse carried the reciter along.

The latter half-verse is usually of types (1), (2), or (3), with three
accents. Examples of (1) occur in 3, 16, 17, 20, 41, 50; of (2), in 1, 7,
8, 26, 32; of (3), in 10, 18, 19, 28, 39. But some occur of a still shorter
type, viz. A b A b A; as in--ón his fáir-e fél, 76; so also in 79, 107,
109, 128. When an unaccented syllable is dropped, we even find such lines
as--sýk thér he láy, 11 (A A b A); sýk thát he láy, 21 (the same); whán he
góod cówd-e, 48 (A b A A b); he láy stóon-stíll-e, 67 (b A A A b); and the
like. Whether the number of accents in the second half-line was ever
diminished to _two_, may be doubted. Rather we may suppose that, in
reciting the lines slowly but emphatically, a fictitious additional accent
was placed upon the _italicised_ syllables in such half-lines as--by
sé-ÿnt[102] _Mar_-týn, 53; wálk-_yng-e_ thár-e, 89; be bét-_en_ anón, 115;
and árt _so_ yíng, 148; a rám _and_ a ríng, 172; to wénd-e _ther_-tó, 173.
This slippery matter I leave to the reader's discretion.

§ 32. An excellent critical examination of the Tale of Gamelyn, by E.
Lindner, appeared in the Englische Studien, ed. E. Kölbing, vol. ii. pp.
94, 321 (1878). He made, however, the unlucky mistake of confusing MS.
Harl. 1758 with MS. Harl. 7334, not being aware that there are _two_ copies
of the poem in the Harleian collection; thus unfortunately missing the
readings of MS. Harl. 7334, which is much the best copy, and would have
solved some at least of his difficulties. Nevertheless, his article is
highly useful, and I must refer the reader to it for further information. I
here briefly note a few of his results.

He remarks that Gamelyn was first composed for recitation; observe the
frequent use of _litheth_, i.e. 'listen ye,' at the beginning of each
section of the lay; see ll. 1, 169, 289, 341, 551, 769; cf. l. 615. For a
comparison of Gamelyn with Lodge's novel called 'Euphues golden Legacie'
(see § 34), he refers us to Delius' edition of Shakespeare, ii. 347 (1872).
At p. 101, he gives a complete Rime-index to the whole poem, and at p. 107
notices some false rimes. The rimes (he says) are chiefly of the most
ordinary character, and the poem is very inartificial; see, e.g., ll.
135-8, 261-270, 315-8, 529-534, 649-652, 729-732, 811-4; &c. The author
constantly repeats himself; note the repetition of _sore_, 10, 11; _for to
dele_, 42, 43; ll. 72, 73; 85-6, compared with 97-8; _al that my fader me
biquath_, 99, 157, 160, 360; 120-1; 149, 150, compared with 151-4; 190-1,
&c. Short expressions or 'tags' occur over and over again; as _ther he
lay_, 11, 21, 25, 33, 50, 52, 66; _Cristes curs mot he have_, 106, 114,
116, 818; _by Cristes ore_, 139, 159, 231, 323; _he began to goon_, 126,
220, 236, 498; _evel mot ye thee_, 131, 363, 448, 720; cf. 379, 413, 517;
_whyl he was on lyve_, 20, 58, 157, 225, 228. There are frequent examples
of alliteration, as _litheth and lesteneth_, 1; _bote of bale_, 32, 34;
_stondeth alle stille_, 55; _stoon-stille_, 67, &c.; more examples can
easily be found. We also find repetitions of ideas, the latter part of the
verse merely reproducing the former, as in 107, 174, 217, 221, 381, 699,
732. At p. 324, is an analysis of some of the looser rimes. At p. 328, is
an analysis of the grammatical forms and of the varieties of spelling. At
p. 113, Lindner is inclined to connect the story with the time of Fulke
Fitz Warin, i.e. with the time of King John[103]; see Ten Brink, Early Eng.
Literature (English version), p. 149. At p. 321, he says that the
description of Gamelyn's brother's house, with its hall-door (461), outer
gate (286), postern-gate (589), bower (405), &c., suits the description of
an Anglo-Norman manor-house of the thirteenth[104] century; see T. Wright,
A History of English Culture, London, 1874. The father of the hero was
evidently a Norman knight; cf. l. 108.

§ 33. Little need be said of previous editions of the Tale of Gamelyn. It
was first printed, in a worthless text, with capricious alterations, by
Urry, in 1721[105]. But in 1847, Mr. T. Wright printed it for the Percy
Society, from the best text, viz. that in MS. Harl. 7334; yet he, somewhat
carelessly, omitted three lines (563, 601, 602). This was reprinted in
Bell's Chaucer, with the omission of the same three lines. In Morris's
Chaucer, the three missing lines are restored; but in some other places,
the edition follows Mr. Wright's text rather than the MS. Dr. Furnivall's
Six-text edition contains the text of six _other_ MSS.; he purposely
omitted MS. Harl. 7334, on the ground that it was already in type; whence
Lindner's very natural mistake. I have thus had the great advantage of
collating the readings of MS. Harl. 7334 with those of six other MSS., to
the improvement of the text as a whole. All the copies go back to _one_
original; the second best copy is in the Corpus MS., from which the
Lansdowne MS. does not greatly vary. The other MSS. give inferior readings,
the Sloane MS. being the worst. For further particulars, I refer the reader
to the Notes in vol. v.; and to the somewhat fuller account in my separate
edition of the Tale of Gamelyn, published at Oxford in 1884.

§ 34. Long before the Tale of Gamelyn first appeared in print, a MS. copy
was consulted by Thomas Lodge, who founded upon it part of a prose story,
which was afterwards printed at London in 1592 with the title: 'Euphues
golden Legacie, found after his death in his Cell at Silexedra, bequeathed
to Philavtus Sonnes, nvrsed vp with their Father in England.' Of this novel
there is a convenient reprint in Shakespeare's Library, ed. W. C. Hazlitt,
vol. ii. An analysis of this story, comparing it with 'Gamelyn,' is given
in my separate edition already referred to; and copious extracts from it
are given by Mr. W. Aldis Wright in his Introduction to his edition of As
you Like It. The result is interesting; for it is abundantly clear that
this play of Shakespeare's is founded upon Lodge's novel, and that Lodge's
novel is a re-cast of the Tale of Gamelyn.

I must not omit to add that I am under considerable obligation to an
excellent article on Gamelyn by Prof. Zupitza, which appeared in the
Jahrbuch der deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft, vol. xxi. p. 69 (Weimar,
1886).


GROUP B.

§ 35. THE WORDS OF THE HOST TO THE COMPANY. Group A terminates abruptly,
and is wholly unconnected with all that follows. Group B introduces us to a
new Fragment, longer and more complete than any other in the Series. The
Man of Lawe, the Shipman, the Prioresse, the Poet himself, the Monk, and
the Nun's Priest, follow each other in unbroken succession; the only hitch
being in the connexion between the Man of Lawe and the Shipman, which is
explained in its due place. The Group is incomplete, rather at the
beginning than at the end; see above.

The opening passage (B 1-98) is of considerable importance, as it contains
the line (l. 5) which gives the date, viz. April 18, of one of the days of
the pilgrimage, and the statement, that on that day the sun's altitude was
45 degrees at 10 A.M. (B 12-14); and further, because it gives a list of
the Tales which Chaucer meant to include in his Legend of Good Women, in
order to complete it, though this, after all, was left undone. These points
are discussed in the Notes to B 3 and B 61, which see. In ll. 78 and 81, it
has usually been supposed (and probably with justice) that Chaucer is
referring to Gower's Confessio Amantis, inasmuch as Gower actually gives
the stories of Canacee and Apollonius. As this is a point of some
difficulty (for it cannot be settled without carefully considering the
dates at which Chaucer's Man of Lawes Tale and Gower's long poem were,
respectively, written), it is again considered below, in the remarks upon
the Tale itself.

The reference (in B 61) to the Legend of Good Women shews that these
'Wordes of the Host' were written after 1385, but before the idea of
continuing the Legend had been definitely abandoned, as, in course of time,
was certainly the case. This will suit very well with the supposed date of
1387, which, from other considerations, is probably the correct one; see §
3, above, p. 374.

The reference in l. 96--'I speke in prose'--looks, at the first glance, as
if Chaucer had originally intended to assign a prose Tale to the Man of
Lawe; and indeed, the Tale of Melibeus would have suited him well enough,
for Albertano of Brescia, its real author, was actually bred up to the law.
As it stands, I take it to mean that _speke_ is here used in a technical
sense--i.e. I am accustomed, in the law-courts, to speak in prose[106],
whereas riming is Chaucer's business; if then, I tell a tale in my ordinary
manner, it will, as compared with _his_ manner, seem like 'baked haws' as
compared with excellent fare. We may even suppose it to be feigned that the
Man of Lawe did really, _at the time_, relate the story in prose, on the
understanding that Chaucer might versify it afterwards: 'lat him rymes
make,' i.e. let him make verse of it. This is a natural interpretation to
put upon the matter; moreover, it left Chaucer free, after all, to tell the
story after _his own_ fashion, and even to insert, as we shall soon see, a
portion of one of his own early translations into various parts both of the
Prologue and of the Tale.

We may also observe the great skill with which Chaucer evades the
difficulty of assigning to the Man of Law a Tale which is not particularly
suited for him. The speaker says below (B 131) that it is not a tale of his
own, but was 'taught' him by 'a marchaunt.' Accordingly, in B 135, we learn
that the Tale came originally from some Syrian 'chapmen,' who learnt it
when sojourning in Rome (148). It thus becomes, as it were, a merchant's
Tale.

The apostrophe addressed to Poverty, in ll. 99-121 (really taken from one
of Chaucer's own poems, as shewn in § 36), is by no means out of place; for
it leads up to the mention of the 'rich merchants' in l. 122, who toil to
avoid it. And it is to one of these that the Tale is supposed to be due.

§ 36. THE MAN OF LAW'S PROLOGUE. This Prologue has a peculiar and special
interest, from the fact that, in the first three stanzas and part of the
fourth (as well as in some stanzas of the Tale), the poet has preserved for
us a portion of one of his early works. In ll. 414-5 of the older Prologue
to the Legend of Good Women, Chaucer tells us that he not only translated
Boece in prose, but also (the piece called) 'Of the Wreched Engendring of
Mankinde, As man may in Pope Innocent y-finde'; i.e. the treatise by
Innocent, afterwards Pope Innocent III., entitled De Contemptu Mundi sive
de Miseria Conditionis Humanae. In the present passage (B 99-111), we have
a portion of this same treatise in a verse form, as becomes evident upon
comparison. This interesting discovery was first made by Prof. Lounsbury,
and announced in the 'Nation' (an American journal) for July, 1889; and
soon after (quite independently, as I have reason to know, and as Prof.
Lounsbury very properly acknowledges) by Dr. E. Köppel, in an article
contributed to the 'Archiv für das Studium der Neueren Sprachen und
Litteraturen,' vol. 84, (1890), p. 405. See Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer,
ii. 333. Neither does the present passage exhaust this source; for there
are yet four more stanzas inserted in the Tale itself, which really belong
to the same treatise. These passages being all of high interest, owing to
the peculiar use made of them by Chaucer, the original Latin is here given.

(_a_) B 99-121. The original is from De Cont. Mundi, lib. 1. cap. 16.
'Pauperes enim premuntur inedia, cruciantur aerumna, fame, siti, frigore,
nuditate: uilescunt, tabescunt, spernuntur, et confunduntur. O miserabilis
mendicantis condicio; et si petit, pudore confunditur; et si non petit,
egestate consumitur, sed ut mendicet, necessitate compellitur.

(106) Deum causatur iniquum, quod non recte diuidat; proximum criminatur
malignum, quod non plene subueniat. Indignatur, murmurat, imprecatur.

(113) Aduerte super hoc sententiam Sapientis: Melius est, inquit, mori quam
indigere [Ecclus. xl. 28]. Etiam proximo suo pauper odiosus erit [Prov.
xiv. 20]. Omnes dies pauperis mali, [Prov. xv. 15]--

(120) fratres hominis pauperis oderunt eum. Insuper et amici procul
recesserunt ab eo' [Prov. xix. 7.]

(_b_) B 421-427. From De Cont. Mundi, lib. i. cap. 23; headed De Inopinato
Dolore. 'Semper enim mundanae laetitiae tristitia repentina succedit. Et
quod incipit a gaudio, desinit in moerore. Mundana quippe felicitas multis
amaritudinibus est respersa. Nouerat hoc qui dixerat: Risus dolore
miscebitur, et extrema gaudii luctus occupat [Prov. xiv. 13].... Attende
salubre consilium: In die bonorum, non immemor sis malorum' [cf. Eccles.
vii. 14; xi. 8].

(_c_) B 771-7. From De Cont. Mundi, lib. ii. c. 19; De Ebrietate. 'Quid
turpius ebrioso? cui fetor in ore, tremor in corpore, qui promittit multa,
promit occulta, cui mens alienatur, facies transformatur? Nullum enim
secretum ubi regnat ebrietas' [Prov. xxxi. 4; in the Vulgate].

(_d_) B 925-931. From De Cont. Mundi, lib. ii. c. 21. 'O extrema libidinis
turpitudo, quae non solum mentem effeminat, sed etiam corpus eneruat; non
solum maculat animam, sed foedat personam.'

(_e_) B 1134-1141. From De Cont. Mundi, lib. i. c. 22; De Breui Laetitia
Hominis. 'A mane usque ad uesperam mutabitur tempus [Ecclus. xviii. 26]....
Quis unquam uel unicum diem totum duxit in sua delectatione iucundum, quem
in aliqua parte diei reatus conscientiae, uel impetus irae, uel motus
concupiscentiae non turbauerit? Quem liuor inuidiae uel ardor auaritiae,
uel tumor superbiae non uexauerit? Quem aliqua iactura, uel offensa, uel
passio non commouerit?'

It thus becomes evident that this Prologue is closely related to the
inserted stanzas in B 421-7, 771-7, 925-31, and 1135-41. All of these
insertions are, in fact, digressions, and have nothing to do with the
story. I conclude that the Prologue and the four inserted stanzas were
placed where they now are at the time of the revision of what was once an
independent tale, written at an earlier period, viz. before 1385, and
probably about 1380. The poem 'Of the Wrecched Engendring of Mankinde' was
in existence still earlier. Observe further, that lines 131-3 may be taken
to mean, in plain English, that 'I, the poet, should be in want of a Tale
to insert here, and should have to write one for the occasion, only I
happen, by good fortune, to have one by me which will do very well.' Thus
the obliging 'Merchant' who 'taught' Chaucer the Man of Lawes Tale was his
industrious younger self. The word 'Merchant' clearly refers to the chapmen
or merchants mentioned in B 135, 148, 153, who are supposed to have picked
up the story, as has been already said (§ 35).

§ 37. THE MAN OF LAWES TALE. The Words of the Host and the Prologue
together contain 133 lines, so that the Tale itself begins with l. 134. We
can easily see, from the style and by the metrical form, that this Tale is
a piece of Chaucer's early workmanship, and was revised for insertion among
the Tales, with the addition of a Prologue and four stanzas[107], about
1387.

Tyrwhitt has drawn attention to the fact that a story, closely agreeing
with the Man of Lawes Tale, is found in Gower's Confessio Amantis, Book II
(ed. Pauli, i. 179-213). The expression 'som men wolde seyn,' in ll. 1009
and 1086, led him to suppose that Chaucer took the story from Gower; but
this expression can be otherwise explained (see notes to the lines)[108],
and the borrowing seems to have been the other way, as will appear if the
question be handled with the necessary care.

Before comparing Chaucer's Tale with Gower's, it is first of all necessary
to observe that, for the most part, they drew their materials from a common
source; a fact which has been completely proved by Lücke[109], who clearly
shews that each of the poets preserves details which the other omits. Their
common original is found in the Life of Constance, as narrated in the
Anglo-Norman Chronicle of Nicholas Trivet, written about A.D. 1334. Mr.
Thomas Wright, in his edition of the Canterbury Tales, pointed out that
Trivet's Chronicle contains the original of the story as told by Gower.
That it also contains the original of the story as told by Chaucer is
evident from the publications of the Chaucer Society. Trivet's version of
the story was edited for that Society by Mr. Brock in 1872, with an English
translation, and a careful line-by-line analysis of it, shewing clearly the
exact extent to which Chaucer followed his original. The name of the
publication is 'Originals and Analogues of some of Chaucer's Canterbury
Tales,' published for the Chaucer Society; Part I, 1872; Part II, 1875. To
this I am indebted for much of the information here given[110]. It appears
that Nicholas Trivet was an English Dominican friar, who died some time
after 1334. A short account of him in Latin, with a list of works ascribed
to him, is to be found in Quetif and Echard's Scriptores Ordinis
Praedicatorum[111], tom. i. pp. 561-565; and a notice in English of his
life and some of his works, in the Preface to T. Hog's edition of Trivet's
Annales. Mr. Brock notices eighteen of his works, amongst which it will
suffice to mention here (_a_) his Annales ab origine mundi ad Christum
(Royal MS. 13 B. xvi, &c.); (_b_) his Annales sex Regum Angliae, qui a
comitibus Andegavensibus [counts of Anjou] originem traxerunt (Arundel MSS.
46 and 220, Harl. MSS. 29 and 4322, &c.); and (_c_) his Anglo-Norman
Chronicle, quite a distinct work from the Latin Annales (MS. Arundel 56,
&c.). Of the last there are numerous copies, MS. Arundel 56 being one of
the best, and therefore selected to be printed from for the Chaucer
Society. The heading runs thus:--'Ci comence les Cronicles qe Frere Nichol
Trivet escript a dame Marie, la fille moun seignour le Roi Edward, le fitz
Henri'; shewing that it was written for the princess Mary, daughter of
Edward I, born in 1278, who became a nun at Amesbury in 1285. The story of
Constance begins on leaf 45, back. Gower follows Trivet rather closely,
with but few omissions, and only one addition of any importance, about
thirty lines long. 'Chaucer tells the same story as Trivet, but tells it in
his own language, and in much shorter compass. He omits little or nothing
of importance, and alters only the details.... Chaucer's additions are
many; of the 1029 lines of which the Tale consists, about 350 are Chaucer's
additions. The passages are these:--ll. 190-203; 270-287; 295-315; 330-343;
351-71; 400-10; 421-7; 449-62; 470-504; 631-58; 701-14; 771-84; 811-9;
825-68; 925-45; 1037-43; 1052-78; 1132-41' (Brock).

As to these additions, I have already shewn (in § 36) the origin of ll.
421-7, 771-7, 925-31, and 1135-1141. It is worth notice that the following
passages have also very much the appearance of being added, by way of
commentary, at the time of revision; viz. 190-203, 295-315, 358-371,
449-462, 631-658, 701-714, 827-868. They form no essential part of the
story, whilst, at the same time, some of them are of high excellence.

Tyrwhitt pointed out that much the same story is to be found in the Lay of
Emarè (MS. Cotton, Calig. A. ii, fol. 69), printed by Ritson in the second
volume of his Metrical Romances. He observes: 'The chief differences are,
that Emarè is originally exposed in a boat for refusing to comply with the
desires of the Emperour her father; that she is driven on the coast of
_Galys_, or Wales, and married to the King of that country. The
contrivances of the step-mother, and the consequences of them, are the same
in both stories.' In the Romance of Sir Eglamour (Thornton Romances, ed.
Halliwell, p. 154), the heroine is sent to sea in a ship by herself.

Mr. Thomas Wright further observes: 'The treachery of King Ælla's mother
enters into the French Romance of the Chevalier au Cigne, and into the
still more ancient Anglo-Saxon romance of King Offa, preserved in a Latin
form by Matthew Paris. It is also found in the Italian collection, said to
have been composed in 1378, under the title of Il Pecorone di Ser Giovanni
Fiorentino (an imitation of the Decameron), gior. x. no. 1. The treason of
the Knight who murders Hermengilde is an incident in the French Roman de la
Violette, and in the English metrical romance of Le Bone Florence of Rome
(printed in Ritson's collection); and is found in the English Gesta
Romanorum, c. 69 (ed. Madden)[112], joined, in the latter place, with
Constance's adventure with the steward. It is also found in Vincent of
Beauvais[113], and other writers.' The tale in the Gesta Romanorum is
called 'Merelaus the Emperor' (MS. Harl. 7333, leaf 201), and is printed in
the Originals and Analogues (Chaucer Society), Part I, pp. 57-70. Mr.
Furnivall adds--'This tale was versified by Occleve, who called Merelaus
"Gerelaus;" and Warton quotes Occleve's lines describing how the "the
feendly man" stabs the Earl's child, and then puts the bloody knife into
the sleeping Empress's hand--

  For men shoulde have noon othir deeming
  But she had gilty ben of this murdring.'
          See Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry, ed. 1871, i. 296.

See the whole story in Hoccleve's Works, ed. Furnivall, p. 140. In the
Originals and Analogues, Part I. pp. 71-84, is also printed an extract from
Matthew Paris, Vita Offae Primi, ed. Wats, 1684, pp. 965-968, containing
the story of 'King Offa's intercepted Letters and banished Queen.'

Some account of Ser Giovanni is given in Dunlop's History of Fiction, 3rd
ed. 1845, p. 247. He was a Florentine notary, who began his Tales in 1378,
at a village in the neighbourhood of Forli. His work is called Il Pecorone,
i.e. the Dunce, 'a title which the author assumed, as some Italian
academicians styled themselves Insensati, Stolidi, &c., appellations in
which there was not always so much irony as they imagined.' The first tale
of the tenth Day is thus analysed by Dunlop: 'Story of the Princess Denise
of France, who, to avoid a disagreeable marriage with an old German prince,
escapes in disguise to England, and is there received in a convent. The
king, passing that way, falls in love with and espouses her. Afterwards,
while he was engaged in a war in Scotland, his wife brings forth twins; but
the queen-mother sends to acquaint her son that his spouse had given birth
to two monsters. In place of his majesty's answer, ordering them to be
nevertheless brought up with the utmost care, she substitutes a mandate for
their destruction, and also for that of the queen. The person to whom the
execution of this command is entrusted, allows the queen to depart with her
twins to Genoa. At the end of some years she discovers her husband at Rome,
on his way to a crusade; she there presents him with his children, and is
brought back with them in triumph to England.' Dunlop points out the
likeness of this story to those told by Chaucer and Gower, mentions the Lay
of Emarè, and adds: 'it is the subject, too, of a very old French romance,
published in 4to without date, entitled Le Roman de la Belle Helene de
Constantinople. There, as in Emarè, the heroine escapes to England to avoid
a marriage, &c. At length she is ordered to be burnt, but is saved by the
Duke of Gloster's niece kindly offering to personate her on that occasion.'
The story appears again in a collection of tales by Straparola, in the
fourth tale of the first night; but Straparola merely borrowed it from Ser
Giovanni. See Dunlop, Hist. Fiction, 3rd ed. p. 268.

A very similar story is told in the Roman de la Manekine, by Philippe de
Reimes, edited by F. Michel for the Bannatyne Club in 1840. For a brief
analysis of this story, see Bibliographia Britannica Literaria
(Anglo-Norman Period); by T. Wright, p. 344.

Ten Brink bids us observe the strong Christian element in the original
story. Constance herself is almost a personification of the Christian
Church, afflicted and persecuted, but at last victorious.

It occurs to me that Shakespeare, in delineating Imogen, did not forget
Chaucer's portrait of Constance.

§ 38. We must now compare Gower's version of this Tale with Chaucer's,
which at once raises the question as to priority of composition; and there
can be little doubt that, as a matter of fact, Chaucer's story was written
_first_. We must first of all notice that _both_ stories really existed in
two editions; and it is precisely this fact that makes caution necessary.
Most likely, Chaucer first wrote his story about 1380 or even earlier, and
revised it about 1387. But meanwhile Gower had been busy with his Confessio
Amantis, which was certainly written _before_ 1386, and seems to have been
in hand in 1382-5; see Dr. Pauli's preface to Gower, pp. xxviii, xxxii. It
was revised, as Gower himself tells us, in the sixteenth year of king
Richard II., i.e. in 1392-3. From this the order of things readily appears,
and may conveniently be tabulated as follows:--

(_a_) Chaucer's first edition; ab. 1380.

(_b_) Gower's first edition; ab. 1382-5.

(_c_) Chaucer's second edition; ab. 1387.

(_d_) Gower's second edition; ab. 1393.

We can hence understand what happened. After Chaucer had written his story,
he doubtless lent Gower, then his particular friend, a copy. Gower took
advantage of the occasion to introduce some expressions which certainly
give the impression that he copied them; for several of these verbal
resemblances occur in places where there was little or nothing in the
original to suggest the phrases which he actually used. Lücke (in Anglia,
xiv. 183) gives twenty-seven examples of this, and draws what is, in my
opinion, the erroneous conclusion, that it was Chaucer who copied Gower;
which seems like suggesting that Tennyson was capable of borrowing from
Martin Tupper.

We may readily understand that, if Chaucer observed this use of his work,
it could not have given him much pleasure; and perhaps we may here see some
reason for the seemingly undue asperity with which, in his revised edition,
he refers to Gower's performance; see B 77-89, and the notes. On the other
side Gower, who in his first edition, just near the end, had introduced a
complimentary allusion to Chaucer, may well have thought fit to suppress
that passage in his revised copy, from which it is certainly absent. This
seems to me to be the simplest solution of the facts as they stand.

I here take occasion to give my proposed explanation of Gower's reference
to Chaucer in his first edition, where he puts _into the mouth of the
goddess Venus_ the following words (ed. Pauli, iii. 374):--

 'And grete wel Chaucer, whan ye mete,
  As _my_ disciple and _my_ poete.
  For, _in the floures of his youthe_,
  In sondry wyse, as he wel couthe,
  Of ditees and of songes glade,
  The which he _for my sake_ made,
  The lond fulfild is overal;
  Wherof to him in special
  Above al other I am most holde.
  Forthy now, in his dayes olde,
  Thou shalt him telle this message,
  That he, upon his later age,
  To sette an ende of al his werke,
  As he, which is _myn owne clerke_,
  Do make _his testament of love_,
  As thou hast do thy shrifte above,
  So that _my court it may recorde_.'

These lines are followed by a laudation of King Richard, which Gower
afterwards conscientiously suppressed. The course of events had shewn him
that such praise was unfitting.

I take it that these lines were written in 1385, at the very time when the
author learnt that his friend Chaucer was at work upon a new poem which he
meant to be a great work, viz. the Legend of Good Women. This poem Venus
might well claim as being written by her own clerk, as a testament of love,
containing legacies of bright examples set by Love's martyrs; and, just as
Gower wrote his own poem as a 'shrift,' Chaucer was writing his as a
'penance' (Leg. Good Women, 491) at the command of Cupid (437, 548), a
command which was given _at his court_ (352). We can readily understand how
Venus could speak of Cupid's court as being her own court; it makes no
practical difference.

It remains to shew (with Lücke) that Chaucer and Gower both knew Trivet,
and that Gower's language sometimes resembles Chaucer's rather than
Trivet's.

The former proposition is soon settled. Where Trivet says, 'et ferri tiel
coup en le haterel le feloun' (p. 23, l. 30), Chaucer has, 'A hand him
smoot upon the nekke-bon' (669); but Gower omits to mention the
'nekke-bone,' which translates _haterel_. This shews that Chaucer used
Trivet's text. On the other hand, Gower mentions Knaresburgh (i. 191),
which he found in Trivet, whilst Chaucer says nothing about it; see note to
B 729.

As to the instances in which one poet has copied the other, whilst at the
same time Trivet does not suggest the phraseology which they employ, Lücke
gives twenty-seven examples in Anglia, xiv. 183. Some of these are rather
far-fetched and doubtful, and not many of them are very clear; but their
cumulative evidence sufficiently proves the fact. I shall only adduce the
clearer cases.

'Ch.' means Chaucer, and 'G.' is Gower. I correct Pauli's spelling.

Ch. B 430:--

  Ben al to-hewe and stiked _at the bord_.

G. i. 182, l. 29:--

  _Endlong the bord_ as they be set

Trivet merely says that they killed all the Christians.

Ch. B 436:--

  That of the _conseil_ of the sowdan woot.

G. 182, l. 25:--

  And alle tho, that hadden be...
  Of _counseil_ to the mariage.

Trivet merely says--the other converts to the faith.

Ch. B 438 (not in Trivet):--

  And Custance han they _take anon_, foot-hoot.

G. 183, l. 15:--

  This olde fend, this Sarazin
  Let _take anon_ this Constantin.

Ch. B 439:--

  And in _a shippe al sterelees_, god woot.

G. 183, l. 19:--

  _A_ naked _ship, withoute stere_.

This instance is the more remarkable because Trivet says, 'saunz sigle et
sauntz neuiroun,' i.e. without sail or oar, without any mention of the
_stere_ or rudder. Ch. B 535 (not in Trivet):--

  But _Hermengild lovede hir right as hir lyf_.

G. 184, l. 29:--

  Dame _Hermegild ...
            ... liche her owne lyf
  Constance loveth_.

This, at any rate, is a clear case.

Ch. B 562:--

  Dame _Hermengild, yif me my sighte agayn_.

G. 185, ll. 13, 15:--

  O _Hermegilde ... yif me my sighte_.

Trivet's expression is different, viz. 'Hermegild, ... I pray thee to make
the sign of the rood on my blind eyes.'

Ch. B 599:--

  Al _softely is to the bed y-go_.

G. 187, l. 18:--

  And _to the bed he stalketh stille_.

Trivet does not refer to this _motion towards_ the bed; he merely says that
Constance and Hermegild were both in the same bed.

Ch. B 620:--

  Berth hir on hand that she _hath doon this thing_.

G. 188, l. 15:--

  Saith that Custance hath _don this dede_.

Trivet puts it differently--'he heaped the death hugely on the maid.'

Ch. B 685:--

  _The king, and many another in that place_,
  Converted was.

G. 190, l. 7:--

  _The king, with many another mo_,
  He cristned.

It is remarkable that Trivet says that king Alle caused _himself_ to be
baptized; there is not a word about _others_.

Ch. B 721, 2:--

  She halt _hir chambre_, abyding Cristes wille.
  The _tyme is come_, a knave-child she ber.

G. 191, ll. 1-3:--

  _The tyme_ set of kinde _is come_,
  This lady hath _her chambre_ nome,
  And of a sone bore fulle, &c.

A clear case; Trivet uses no such expressions.

Ch. B 759:--

  But of his owene bond _he wroot ageyn_.

G. 193, l. 3:--

  _He wroot ayein._

Here the French text has 'rescrit,' wrote back.

Ch. B 799:--

  But _in the same ship as he hir fond_.

G. 194, l. 11:--

  That ye _the same ship_ vitaille,
  _In which that she took arrivaille_.

A remarkable case; for Trivet makes it a new ship--'vne neef.'

Ch. B 825:--

  _kneling on the stronde_ (not in Trivet).

G. 195, l. 7:--

  _Knelend upon her bare knee._

Ch. B 916:--

  _Com into ship._

G. 196, l. 28:--

  _cam to ship._

Trivet uses the expression 'descendi,' i.e. came down.

Ch. B 1045:--

  _Goth Alla, for to seen this_ wonder chaunce.

G. 207, l. 23:--

  _To see this_ Custe _goth the king_.

Trivet has it differently.

Ch. B 1093:--

  The emperour hath graunted gentilly.

G. 209, l. 19:--

  This lord hath graunted his requeste.

Taken altogether, these appropriations by Gower, though not in themselves
very marked, must have been annoying to his brother-poet.

It is worth while to notice that, in the three cases of the Wyf of Bathes
Tale, the Phisiciens Tale, and the Maunciples Tale, Chaucer and Gower again
tell the same stories; and though Chaucer wrote at a later date, he
certainly has not copied.

§ 39. THE SHIPMAN'S PROLOGUE. This Prologue is assigned to the Shipman in
MS. Arch. Seld. only; see the footnote to B 1179. MS. Harl. 3774 assigns it
to the Sompnour; whilst very many MSS. assign it to the Squire. The three
chief MSS. (E., Hn., Cm.) omit it altogether; from which we may perhaps
infer that it was a very late addition to the set of Tales.

In order to exhibit the variations of the MSS. more clearly, Dr. Furnivall
has printed this Prologue from no less than twenty-two MSS., with the
result that only one, viz. MS. Arch. Seld. above, rightly assigns it to the
Shipman and, at the same time, places it after the Man of Lawes Tale. Three
of the MSS., viz. Harl. 7334, Rawl. Misc. 1133, and Royal 17 D. XV, assign
it to the Sompnour, but they are all clearly wrong, because,
notwithstanding this mention of the Sompnour, the Tale that follows is
assigned, in the first, to the Wyf of Bathe, and, in the others, to the
Squire! Eighteen of the MSS. assign this Prologue to the Squire, and insert
his Tale after it. We may hence conclude that, in some early copies, a
displacement of the Tales occurred at this point.

But it is easy to see that MS. Arch. Seld., the sole authority for the
present arrangement, is here quite right[114]. The latter part of the
Prologue (B 1178-90) is quite unsuited to the character of the Squire, but
in keeping with that of the Shipman. Further, the Squire has a Prologue of
his own, though it is incomplete in the sense that there is no indication
whom the Squire is to follow (F 1-8). But the clearest proof that the
author's _latest_ intention was to place both the Shipman's Prologue and
Tale precisely _here_, and nowhere else, appears from the following facts.
First, we see, as above, that it is clearly a Shipman's Prologue, and
therefore precedes the Shipman's Tale; whilst there is an obvious allusion
in it to the Man of Lawes Tale as being the one which it must needs follow.
The former of these points was seen by Tyrwhitt long ago; and he
accordingly assigned this Prologue to the Shipman. The latter point was
made by Mr. Henry Bradshaw, who conclusively shewed that no other
arrangement would suit, by pointing to the author's own words. Thus, in B
46, the Man of Lawe says--'I can right now _no thrifty tale_ seyn,' and is
inclined to be apologetic; but, after the tale is told, the Host is well
pleased, and consoles him in express terms in the words--'This _was a
thrifty tale_ for the nones.' And, to put the matter beyond dispute, turns
to the Persone, with the words--'I see wel that _ye lerned men in lore_,'
meaning the Persone and the Man of Lawe. In most MSS., the Shipman's Tale
follows the Pardoner's; which involves the difficulty of making the Host
call the Pardoner 'a lerned man in lore.' The proof that this is the very
last title the Host would have bestowed on the Pardoner, is given in C
942-968, where the Host's contempt of the Pardoner is expressed in the
strongest terms which he could command; and his capabilities of expression
were considerable. Few happier hits have been made than the convincing
argument which we are glad to owe to Mr. Bradshaw, whose knowledge of
Chaucer's text was believed by many scholars to be without parallel.

But the story of the Shipman's Prologue is not yet ended. Many scribes
perceived how ill suited this Prologue was for following the Pardoner's
Tale, or the Cook's Tale, or the Tale of Gamelyn, which were the places it
was sometimes made to occupy. In order to remedy this apparent defect, a
_spurious_ Shipman's Prologue was concocted, consisting of but twelve
lines. This is the Prologue given in the black-letter editions, which, in
order to make the true Shipman's Prologue do duty for a Squire's Prologue,
actually resorted to the arbitrary process of suppressing the true Squire's
Prologue altogether! I here give this spurious Prologue, but in true
Chaucerian spelling, in order to shew more clearly how ill some of the
lines scan. I follow mainly the Petworth MS., denoted by 'Pt.'; and give
all the variations worth mentioning that occur in the other eight MSS.,
viz. Roy. (Royal 18 C ii), Sl. (Sloane 1685), B. (Barlow 20), H. (Hatton
1), M. (Camb. Univ. Lib. Mm. 2. 5), R. (Rawl. Poet. 149), L. (Laud 739),
and I. (Camb. Univ. Lib. li. 3. 26).


      SPURIOUS SHIPMAN'S PROLOGUE.

 'Now freendes,' seide our Host so dere,
 'How lyketh yow by Iohn the Pardonere?
  For he hath unbokeled wel the male;
  He hath us told right a thrifty tale,
  As touching of misgovernaunce.                                          5
  I prey to God, yeve him good chaunce,
  As ye han herd of thise ryotoures three.
  Now, gentil Mariner, hertely I preye thee,
  Tel us a good tale, and that right anon.'
 'It shal be doon, by God and by Seint Iohn,'                            10
  Seide this Mariner, 'as wel as ever I can':
  And right anon his tale he bigan.                                      12

As to these lines, I will merely make the following remarks. Line 1 is too
short by a whole foot; and so is l. 5. Lines 8 and 11 are somewhat too
long. Line 4 will scan well, if we substitute _told-e_ for _told_, as some
of the MSS. do; but, unfortunately, _told-e_ is here an impossible form.
Line 3 is imitated from A 3115; and l. 10 from B 1019. In l. 7, we must
suppress _of_, in order to make the line run well; only this destroys the
sense. It is not easy to imitate Chaucer's language for twelve lines
together, especially when sense has to be regarded. Moreover, the way in
which l. 7 is made to depend on l. 6 is extremely awkward.

In the true Prologue, the Shipman gives due notice that he is going to tell
a 'merry,' i.e. a licentious story; which he proceeds to do.

§ 40. THE SHIPMANNES TALE. A similar Tale occurs in Boccaccio's Decamerone,
Day 8, Nov. 1. The scene is laid in Milan; the husband is a rich merchant
named Guasparruol Cagastraccio; and his wife's name is Ambruogia. The
gallant is Gulfardo, a German, and not a priest. The sum borrowed is 200
florins; which Gulfardo restores to the wife in the presence of a witness,
so that she is obliged to admit its repayment. The place to which the
merchant goes, on a business errand, is Genoa.

It is not at all likely that Chaucer took this from the Decamerone, which
he seems never to have read. He probably found it in some French _fabliau_,
and treated the story, as usual, so as to make it all his own. In B 1404,
we find the French phrase '_Qui la?_' The scene is laid near Paris, and
France is specially mentioned in B 1306, 1341, 1384. The merchant's
business calls him away to Bruges (1448).

There is a curious difficulty in the opening lines of this Tale. The use of
the words _us_ (B 1202, 1209), _we_ (1204), and _our_ (1208), certainly
shew that, in the first instance, this Tale was meant to be told by a
woman; and, obviously, by the Wyf of Bathe in particular (cf. D 337-356).
When Chaucer changed his mind, he forgot to make here the necessary
corrections.

'The same fable ... is repeated by La Fontaine (Contes, ii. 9), in his
usual forcible and witty way; but neither Boccaccio nor La Fontaine can vie
with Chaucer's art.'--Ten Brink.

§ 41. THE PRIORESS'S PROLOGUE. This Prologue requires no explanation. The
responsibility passes from the Shipman to the Prioress with perfect ease.

§ 42. THE PRIORESSES TALE. The real Prologue to this Tale is contained in B
1637-1642. What is called, in MSS. E. and Hn., the Prologue is, more
strictly, a Proem; and the Tale itself is, more strictly, a Legend, or (as
the author calls it) a 'song'; B 1677. The Legend, although in stanzas, is
told with practised skill, and probably belongs to the later period. The
Proem resembles that to the Life of Seint Cecile, and contains a similar
invocation to the Virgin. The third stanza reminds us of one in the A. B.
C., viz. that beginning with M. We may note the introduction of the words
'quod she' (1644), and the line 'To telle a storie I wol do my labour'
(1653).

The Tale itself is taken from a source similar to that of the Legend of
Alphonsus of Lincoln, a story reprinted by the Chaucer Society from the
Fortalitium Fidei; Lugdun. 1500, fol. ccviii. In another edition, printed
in 1485, the Legend of Alphonsus is said to have been composed in 1459, and
it is stated to be the work of a Minorite friar, whose name, according to
Hain and others, was Alphonsus a Spina. The story is, that a widow residing
in Lincoln has a son named Alphonsus, ten years of age, who goes daily to
school, singing 'Alma Redemptoris' as he passes through the street where
the Jews dwell. One day the Jews seize him, cut out his tongue, tear out
his heart, and throw his body into a filthy pit. But the Virgin appears to
him, gives him a precious stone in place of a tongue, and enables him to
sing 'Alma Redemptoris' for four days. His mother seeks and finds him, and
he is borne to the cathedral, still singing. The bishop celebrates mass;
the boy reveals the secret, resigns the precious stone to the bishop, gives
up the ghost, and is buried in a marble tomb. A similar legend is narrated
concerning Hugh of Lincoln; see note to B 1874.

In Originals and Analogues of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, pt. iii. (Chaucer
Soc. 1876), is the story of the Paris Beggar-boy murdered by a Jew, printed
from the Vernon MS., leaf 123, back. It is well told, and has some
remarkable points of agreement with the Prioresses Tale. It clearly
identifies the hymn Alma Redemptoris Mater as agreeing with the _second_
anthem mentioned in the Note to B 1708, which is partly translated as
follows:--

   'Godus Moder, mylde and clene,
  Heuene [gh]ate and sterre of se,
  Saue þi peple from synne and we' [_woe_].

The same publication contains a similar story, in French verse, of a boy
killed by a Jew for singing 'Gaude Maria'; from MS. Harl. 4401. The author
was Gautier de Poincy.

Tyrwhitt's account of the Prioresses Tale is as follows: 'The transition
from the Tale of the Shipman to that of the Prioresse is happily managed. I
have not been able to discover from what Legende of the Miracles of Our
Lady the Prioresses Tale is taken. From the scene being laid in Asia, it
should seem, that this was one of the oldest of the many stories which have
been propagated, at different times, to excite or justify several merciless
persecutions of the Jews, upon the charge of murthering Christian children.
The story of Hugh of Lincoln, which is mentioned in the last stanza, is
placed by Matthew Paris under the year 1255. In the first four months of
the Acta Sanctorum by Bollandus, I find the following names of children
canonized, as having been murthered by Jews: xxv Mart. _Willielmus
Norvicensis_, 1144; _Richardus, Parisiis_, 1179; xvii Apr. _Rudolphus,
Bernae_, 1287; _Wernerus, Wesaliae_, anno eodem; _Albertus, Poloniae_,
1598. I suppose the remaining eight months would furnish at least as many
more. See a Scottish Ballad (Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry, i. 32)
upon one of these supposed murthers. The editor [Percy] has very
ingeniously conjectured that "Mirryland" in verse 1 is a corruption of
"Milan." Perhaps the real occasion of the Ballad may have been what is said
to have happened at _Trent_, in 1475, to a boy called _Simon_. The Cardinal
Hadrian, about fifty years after, mentioning the Rocks of Trent, adds--"quo
Iudaei _ob Simonis caedem_ ne aspirare quidem audent;" Praef. ad librum de
Serm. Lat. The change of the name in the Song, from Simon to Hugh, is
natural enough in _this_ country, where similar stories of Hugh of Norwich
and Hugh of Lincoln had been long current.'

The Ballad alluded to is called 'The Jew's Daughter' by Percy, and is to
the effect that a boy named Hugh was enticed to play and then stabbed by a
Jew's daughter, who threw him into a draw-well. His mother, Lady Helen,
finds him by hearing his voice.

For 'Hugh of Norwich,' as mentioned by Tyrwhitt, we should read 'William of
Norwich.' His story is given in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, under the date
1137, on which Prof. Earle remarks--'St. William seems to have retained his
celebrity down to the time of the reformation, at least in Norfolk. In
Loddon church, which is advanced perpendicular of about 1500, there is a
painting of his crucifixion on a panel of the rood-screen, still in fair
preservation.' A wood engraving of this picture is given on the same page
(A.S. Chron., ed. Earle, p. 371). As to the cruel treatment of the Jews,
see the note on 'The Jews in England' in Annals of England, p. 162.

I may add that the story of Hugh of Lincoln, and a picture of the martyrdom
of Simon at Trent, are given in an excellent chapter in Manners, Customs,
and Dress, during the Middle Ages, by P. Lacroix, pp. 434-455.

A modernised version of the Prioresses Tale will be found among
Wordsworth's Poems. It can hardly be said to be satisfactory; and the
language of the original is, for the most part, so simple that the attempt
to modernise it was a needless task. The old idea, that the attempt to read
Chaucer in the original requires almost superhuman ability, will, I hope,
soon be a thing of the past. As a matter of fact, his language is easier
than that of Homer or Vergil; and Englishmen are already ceasing to be
overpowered by a dread of learning facts that concern their own language.

§ 43. PROLOGUE TO SIR THOPAS. This passage, like the Prologues in rimed
couplets, evidently belongs to the late period; we recognise here some of
the author's best work. Notice, in particular, his description of himself.

§ 44. SIR THOPAS. Judging by the rhythm-test, this might be of early
workmanship; but judging by the language, it is late. Like the exceptional
Tale last discussed, it probably belongs to the late period, although not
written in rimed couplets. Tyrwhitt's estimate of it is judicious and
correct. He says--'The Rime of Sir Thopas was clearly intended to ridicule
the "palpable gross" fictions of the common Rimers of that age, and still
more, perhaps, the meanness of their language and versification. It is full
of phrases taken from Isumbras, Li Beaus Desconus, and other Romances in
the same style, which are still extant.... For the more complete
reprobation of this species of Riming, even _the Host_, who is not to be
suspected of too refined a taste, is made to cry out against it, and to cut
short Sire Thopas in the midst of his adventures. Chaucer has nothing to
say for his Rime, but that "it is the best he can" (B 2118), and readily
consents to tell another Tale; but having just laughed so freely at the bad
poetry of his time, he might think it, perhaps, too invidious to exhibit a
specimen of better in his own person, and therefore his other Tale is in
prose, a mere translation from Le Livre de Melibee et de dame Prudence, of
which several copies are still preserved in MS. [See p. 426]. It is in
truth, as he calls it, "a moral tale vertuous," and was probably much
esteemed in its time; but in this age of levity, I doubt some readers will
be apt to regret that he did not rather give us the remainder of Sire
Thopas.'

Sir Thopas is admittedly a burlesque, and several of the passages imitated
are quoted in the Notes; but I cannot quite resist the suspicion that
Chaucer may himself, in his youth, have tried his hand at such
romance-writing in all seriousness, but lived to have a good-humoured laugh
even in some degree at his own expense; and he seems as if endeavouring to
make his readers feel that they could wish there was somewhat more of it.
Yet we cannot but allow that to

 'Praise _syr Topas_ for a noble tale,
  And scorne the story that the Knight told'

is much the same as to

                           'say that Pan
  Passeth Appollo in musike manifold,'

as Sir Thomas Wiat has remarked in his second satire. It may be added that
the usual metrical laws are not quite strictly observed in this Tale.

A dissertation on Sir Thopas by C. J. Bennewitz, of Magdeburg, appeared at
Halle, 1879, with some useful notes; and a still fuller and more elaborate
article, by Prof. E. Kölbing, will be found in the Englische Studien, xi.
495. In the latter especially, a large number of parallel passages are
pointed out, some of which will be found in the Notes. Chaucer has seized
the characteristics of the Romance-writers so well, that it would be an
endless task to exhibit all his imitations. Some of the peculiarities of
our old minstrels are well noted by Bennewitz. For example, they usually
begin by requesting the company to listen (B 1902, 2083). They revel in
similes (B 1915-7, 1920). They often divide their poems into cantos, each
of which was called 'a fit' (B 2078). Sometimes they give us lists of
heroes, as at the beginning of Richard Coer de Lion (B 2088- 2090); and a
description of the particular hero of the romance (B 1914). They are very
fond of hideous giants (B 1997), and of fairies (B 1978, 1992); and, of
course, the heroes are continually riding up and down in quest of some
adventure (B 1988). Of course, we expect occasional mention of the singing
of birds (B 1956); of the springing of herbs (B 1950); and of instruments
of music (B 2005). The knight's steed is often over-ridden (B 1965); and
the knight himself must be consumed by love-longing (B 1975).

It is delightful to observe how Chaucer contrives, often by a mere word, to
give the story a ludicrous turn, as in 1919--'He hadde a semely nose.' The
hero's face is not, as usual, as white 'as a lyly,' but as white 'as
payndemayn,' i.e. the finest bread (1915). His complexion was like 'scarlet
in grain,' i.e. it would not wash out (1917). Among the wild beasts of the
forest are both 'bukke and hare' (1946). Among the growing herbs he
enumerates nutmeg 'to putte in ale' (1953); and so on. The most curious
example of this kind of humour appears in the behaviour of the knight when
attacked by the giant; he quietly makes his escape, on the plea that he
will return next day; and this evasion of present battle is attributed to
God's grace, and to his own 'fair beringe' (2022). It is needless to give
further instances.

Prof. Kölbing bids us observe the varieties in the metre; it would seem
that Chaucer deliberately intended to exhibit the most characteristic forms
of the romantic stanza; for in five cases his examples are unique. The
varieties are eight in all. Examples of these variable stanzas are as
follows. (1) Stanzas with the rimes _aabccb_ (2017). (2) Rimes _aabaab_
(1914). (3) Rimes _aabaab_, _ccbccb_, i.e. two stanzas with the same middle
and final rimes (1902-13). (4) A stanza with the rimes _aab_[gamma]_bbg_,
where [gamma] denotes a line with but _one_ accent, riming with the line
denoted by _g_ (1980). (5) A stanza of ten lines, _aabccb_[gamma]_ddg_
(2071). (6) A stanza of 10 lines, _aabaab_[gamma]_ccg_ (1997). (7) A stanza
of 10 lines, _aabaab_[gamma]_aag_ (1987). (8) A stanza of ten lines,
_aabccb_[gamma]_ccg_ (2007). The use of short lines, with but _one_ accent,
as in 1983, is of frequent occurrence in romances; for examples, see Sir
Gawayne and the Grene Knight, ed. Morris; Sir Tristrem, ed. McNeill
(Scottish Text Soc.); The Pistill of Susan, in Scottish Allit. Poems, ed.
Amours (id.); and cf. York Plays, ed. Miss T. Smith, p. 359, &c. In Sir
Beves of Hamptoun, ed. Kölbing, we find a stanza with the rimes _aabccb_,
followed by one with the rimes _aabaab_ (ll. 55-60, 61-66).

§ 45. PROLOGUE TO MELIBEUS. When the Host suddenly cuts short the Tale of
Sir Thopas, Chaucer takes refuge in prose. The Tale of Melibeus is one
which we should now deem portentously dull; but his hearers were, we must
suppose, highly interested in listening to the various arguments used by
Melibeus and his wife Prudence as to their proper course of action. Indeed,
the Host highly approves of it, and thinks it would have tended to his own
wife's edification. Chaucer also, for his part, undertakes the Tale as a
solemn task, begging pardon beforehand for any variation he may make from
the true and exact version (B 2131).

§ 46. THE TALE OF MELIBEUS. This prose story is merely a translation, and
not always an exact one, of a French treatise entitled Le Livre de Melibee
et de dame Prudence, of which there are two MS. copies in the British
Museum, viz. MSS. Royal 19 C. vii, and 19 C. xi. Tyrwhitt also tells us
that Dufresnoy, in his Bibliothèque des Romans, ii. 248, mentions two
copies in verse, in the Bibliothèque Seguier. Le Livre de Melibee is
likewise not an original work, but an adaptation, with some omissions and
alterations, probably made by Jean de Meun, of a treatise in Latin, viz.
the Liber Consolationis et Consilii of Albertano of Brescia. This work was
admirably edited for the Chaucer Society in 1873 by Thor Sundby, who took
much pains to trace out the originals of the numerous quotations with which
the work abounds; and I am much indebted to him for my Notes. (We are
bidden to observe that there also exists a second version in French prose,
by an anonymous author, of a much more literal character, which is still
unprinted.) Jean de Meun's version was first printed, separately, at the
end of the fifteenth century; again, in 1504, together with the French
translation of the Solatium Ludi Scachorum by Jacques de Cessoles; and
lastly, it appears in the Ménagier de Paris, an early work on domestic
economy which has been lately published by the Société des Bibliophiles
Français. Chaucer's version is from Jean de Meun. Of course, the Latin
original is the ultimate authority in difficult or corrupt passages; on
which account it is often cited in the Notes. I have there given some
curious examples of mistranslation or corruption of the text.

Albertano, born about 1192, was a judge at Brescia in Lombardy (not far
west of the Lago di Garda), and died soon after 1250. He is an author of
some importance to the Chaucer-student, as the poet refers to no less than
three of his works. These are: (1) Liber Consolationis et Consilii (as
above), completed in May, 1246; (2) De Arte Loquendi et Tacendi, cited in
the Notes to the Maunciples Tale; and (3) De Amore et Dilectione Dei,
written in 1238, cited in the Notes to the Marchantes Tale.

§ 47. THE MONK'S PROLOGUE. This Prologue connects Melibeus with the Monkes
Tale. It contains a contribution to the exhibition of the Host's true
character. In B 3116, we are told that the pilgrims are drawing near to
Rochester. The Host then calls upon the Monk for a Tale, who replies that
he can easily relate the Life of Saint Edward, but they would probably
prefer to hear a few Tragedies about the downfall of some illustrious
persons.

§ 48. THE MONKES TALE. Judged by the rhythm, this Tale might belong to the
early period. The subject-matter shews, however, that is was probably
written at different times, part of it at an early period, and part at the
period of revision. It can hardly be called, in strictness, a tale at all,
but consists of a whole series of them, and has all the appearance of
having been originally an independent work, which Chaucer had at one time
begun, but, in his accustomed manner, had left a little less than half
finished. It is formed on the model of Boccaccio's book De Casibus Virorum
Illustrium, the title of which is actually retained in the rubric printed
at p. 244 of vol. iv. The manner in which the poet contrives to assign this
string of tragedies to the monk is highly ingenious. The Host expects to
hear rather a merry and lively story from the jovial and corpulent Monk,
and rallies him upon his sleek appearance; but the Monk, taking all in
patience, volunteers either the Life of Saint Edward the Confessor or else
a few of his 'hundred' tragedies; and then, fearful of interruption,
proceeds to define the word Tragedy, and to start off before any of the
pilgrims have had time to offer any opinion upon the matter. He also offers
an apology for not telling all his stories in strictly chronological order.
This apology is the real key to the whole matter. We may well believe that,
whilst the collection of tragedies was still an independent work, the
arrangement was strictly chronological, or was intended to have been made
such when the work was completed. Such was the usual formula; and
accordingly the author begins, in the most approved fashion, with Lucifer,
and then duly proceeds to Adam and all the rest. But as, in the course of
composition, he would naturally first write such lives as most pleased him,
and by no means succeeding in writing anything like a complete
collection--for out of the 'hundred' that existed 'in his cell'[115] he
produced only seventeen in all--it clearly became his simplest plan to give
specimens only, and to abandon the chronological arrangement as no longer
necessary. Yet it is worth remarking that the tragedies are more clearly in
chronological order than may at first sight appear. If they be compared
with such a book as Peter Comestor's Historia Scholastica, we shall see
this the better. Peter Comestor takes the Bible as the foundation of his
history, noticing secular history as he goes on. We thus find a mention of
Hercules in the time of Jephthah, judge of Israel. Strictly, then, Hercules
should precede Samson; but as they come so near together, the scriptural
character takes precedence. Again, the tragedies of Antiochus and Alexander
both belong, in this way, to the first book of Maccabees, and therefore
come next after the tragedy of Holofernes, which belongs to the book of
Judith. Here, again, Alexander should, in strictness, precede Antiochus,
but this consideration is overridden by the fitness of coupling Antiochus
with Holofernes, and Alexander with Caesar. Allowing, then, that Samson may
precede Hercules, and that Antiochus may precede Alexander, we may divide
the whole series into six groups, as follows:--(_a_) Lucifer, Adam, Samson,
Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar; (_e_)[116] Zenobia; (_f_)[117] Pedro
of Spain, Pedro of Cyprus, Barnabo, Ugolino; (_d_) Nero; (_c_) Holofernes,
Antiochus, Alexander, Caesar; and (_b_) Croesus. This grouping is far more
suggestive than might be expected, for it throws some additional light upon
the matter, if duly considered. In the first place, group (_f_) consists
wholly of what have been called 'modern instances,' as referring to matters
that happened in Chaucer's own time, instead of containing examples from
ancient history; three of the four are remarkably short, and all four only
make up eleven stanzas. One of them, the tragedy of Barnabo, contains the
latest allusion in the whole of the Canterbury Tales, as it has reference
to the year 1385, the probable date of the Prologue to the Legend of Good
Women. The difference in style between the tragedy of Ugolino and such a
tragedy as that of Samson or Hercules, must strike the most careless
reader; and it is easy to see that this group (_f_) was an afterthought,
being a piece added at the period of revision. So much we can tell from
internal evidence, but the fact is curiously corroborated by evidence that
is external. For of course, if the poet added a few tragedies as an
afterthought, he would naturally add them _at the end_; and it is
accordingly a fact that in several good MSS., including the Ellesmere, the
Hengwrt, and the Cambridge MSS., this group is placed _at the end_, after
the tragedy of Croesus. But Chaucer's apology for want of order left him
free to insert them where he pleased; and he was accordingly pleased to put
them in the order in which they appear in the present edition, which
follows the arrangement of the Harleian, Corpus, Petworth, and Lansdowne
MSS. That this removal of group (_f_) from the end to an earlier place is
in accordance with the author's latest intention, is proved by observing
that the tragedy of Croesus must come last: (1) because it repeats, in the
last stanza, the monk's previous definition of tragedy, a repetition of
which the Knight does not approve, and takes occasion to say so (B 3961);
and (2) because the Host also quotes from this last stanza, and ridicules
the expression about Fortune 'covering things with a cloud'; see B 3956,
3972.

But we may, with patience, learn a few things more from the grouping of the
tragedies. Putting aside group (_f_) as an addition at the time of
revision, we may note that group (_e_) follows (_a_), for the simple reason
that the story of Zenobia is in Boccaccio, whom Chaucer was imitating. We
then have only groups (_d_), (_c_), and (_b_) to consider, and we notice at
once that Chaucer has purposely somewhat mixed up these; for, if we merely
transpose (_d_) and (_c_), we bring the tragedy of Nero next that of
Croesus, and immediately preceding it. That is the original order of
things, since the stories of Nero and Croesus are both taken from the
Romaunt of the Rose, where they appear together, and Nero preceded Croesus
in Chaucer's work as a matter of course, because his story preceded that of
Croesus in the original. We have thus the pleasure of seeing Chaucer
actually at work; he begins with Boccaccio and the Vulgate version of the
Bible, drawing upon his recollections[118] of Boethius for the story of
Hercules; he next takes a leaf or two from the Romaunt of the Rose; the
story of Alexander, suggested (see B 3845) by the book of Maccabees, leads
him on to write the tragedy of Caesar; then he tires of his work, and
breaks off. Returning to it for the purpose of filling up his great work,
he adds a few 'modern instances'; mixes up the order of tales; writes an
apology for their want of order; humorously assigns them to the Monk, from
whom the Host had expected something widely different; and makes the Knight
cut him short when the right moment comes. The pilgrims had heard enough
about tragedies, and began to want something more cheerful.

The great collection of tragedies which Chaucer may have originally
contemplated, in imitation of Boccaccio, was fully carried out by his
successor Lydgate, one of whose best works is the 'Falls of Princes.' This
poem, written in Chaucer's favourite seven-line stanza, was not, however,
taken from Boccaccio _directly_, but through the version of a Frenchman
named Laurent de Premierfait, an ecclesiastic of the diocese of Troyes; see
Morley's Eng. Writers, vi. 112, and the excellent dissertation by Dr.
Köppel entitled 'Laurents de Premierfait und John Lydgates Bearbeitungen
von Boccaccios De Casibus Virorum Illustrium'; München, 1885. Lydgate's
poem long continued in favour, and in its turn suggested the famous series
of tragedies by Sackville, Baldwin, and others, known by the name of the
Mirror for Magistrates; see Morley's First Sketch of Eng. Lit., pp.
335-337. The most interesting point in Lydgate's version is his recognition
of Chaucer's Monkes Tale in the following stanza of his prologue:--

 'My mayster Chaucer[119] with his fressh commedies
  Is dede, allas, cheif poete of Bretayne,
  That sumtyme made full pitous tragidies;
  The "fall of princes" he dide also compleyne,
  As he that was of makynge souereyne;
  Whom all this londe of right[e] ought preferre,
  Sith of oure langage he was the lode-sterre.'

There is a poem entitled the Fall of Princis in the Percy Folio MS., ed.
Hales and Furnivall, iii. 168; but it is of no great merit.

The original sources of the various Tragedies are sufficiently indicated in
the Notes.

The metre employed is of some interest. It exhibits the simplest form of
stanza employed by Chaucer, with the rimes arranged in the order _a b a b b
c b c_, and was probably the first French metre which he ever used. It
occurs in his A B C, though the original of that poem is in short lines. A
good example of it, _in French_, will be found in a ballad by Eustache
Deschamps, written on the death of Machault in 1377; see Tarbe's edition,
p. 30. Hence Spenser probably derived his famous stanza, by appending to it
an Alexandrine line.

In this Tale, there are two clear examples of lines in which the first foot
consists of a single syllable. These are:--

  Al | forbrúsëd, bóth-e bákk' and syd-e (3804):
  Wheth | er só he wóok or éllës slépt-e (3809).

And probably l. 3535 is of the same character (see note).

§ 49. THE PROLOGUE OF THE NONNE PRESTES TALE. This excellent Prologue,
which links the Monkes Tale with that of the Nonne Preest, needs no
comment. It is in Chaucer's best manner, like the Tale itself; both clearly
belong to the period of the formation of the Tales into a series. It shews,
moreover, that Chaucer's later taste had taught him to reprobate a style of
writing which he, doubtless, at one time admired. See Lounsbury, Studies in
Chaucer, iii. 334.

§ 50. THE NONNE PREESTES TALE. This is the best specimen of our author's
humour. An early version of the Tale occurs in a short fable by Marie de
France, afterwards amplified in the old French Roman du Renart. The fable
by Marie de France consists of thirty-eight short lines, and is printed in
Dr. Furnivall's Originals and Analogues (Chaucer Society), p. 116, from MS.
Harl. 978, leaf 56 (formerly 76). The corresponding portion of Le Roman de
Rénart, as edited by Méon in 1826, vol. i. p. 49, is also printed in the
same, p. 117; it comprises 454 lines (ll. 1267-1720), and contains the
account of the cock's dream about a strange beast, and other particulars of
which Chaucer makes some use. Professor Ten Brink shews that Marie's fable
closely resembles one found in a Latin collection of Æsopian fables in a
MS. at Göttingen, which he quotes in full (id. p. 114), and refers us for
it to Oesterley, 'Romulus,' Berlin, 1870, p. 108.

A translation of Marie's fable, by myself, was printed in 'The Academy,'
July 23, 1887 (p. 56); and is here reprinted for the purpose of comparison
with Chaucer's story.

      THE COCK AND THE FOX.

  A Cock our story tells of, who
  High on a dunghill stood and crew.
  A Fox, attracted, straight drew nigh,
  And spake soft words of flattery.
   'Dear Sir!' said he, 'your look's divine;
  I never saw a bird so fine!
  I never heard a voice so clear
  Except your father's--ah! poor dear!
  His voice rang clearly, loudly--but
  Most clearly, when his eyes were shut!'
   'The same with me!' the Cock replies,
  And flaps his wings, and shuts his eyes.
  Each note rings clearer than the last--
  The Fox starts up, and holds him fast;
  Towards the wood he hies apace.
    But as he crossed an open space,
  The shepherds spy him; off they fly;
  The dogs give chase with hue and cry.
  The Fox still holds the Cock, though fear
  Suggests his case is growing queer.--
 'Tush!' cries the Cock, 'cry out, to grieve 'em,
 "The cock is mine! I'll never leave him!"'
  The Fox attempts, in scorn, to shout,
  And opes his mouth; the Cock slips out,
  And, in a trice, has gained a tree.
    Too late the Fox begins to see
  How well the Cock his game has play'd;
  For once his tricks have been repaid.
  In angry language, uncontrolled,
  He 'gins to curse the mouth that's bold
  To speak, when it should silent be.
   'Well,' says the Cock, 'the same with me;
  I curse the eyes that go to sleep
  Just when they ought sharp watch to keep
  Lest evil to their lord befall.'
    Thus fools contrariously do all:
  They chatter when they should be dumb,
  And, when they _ought_ to speak, are mum.

Dryden's version of this Tale, entitled The Cock and the Fox, must be
familiar to all readers.

In Reliquiae Antiquae, ed. Halliwell and Wright, ii. 272, a humorous fable,
entitled the Vox [Fox] and the Wolf, is printed from MS. Digby, 86. The
first sixty-four lines give an account of a hungry fox, who breaks into a
farm-yard and has a parley with a cock who had 'flowen on hey.' The fox
tries to persuade the cock to come down from his lofty position:--

 'Quath the wox, "Sire chauntecler,
  Thou fle adoun, and com me ner."'

But in this case, the cock knows better, and tells the fox to go away; and
Reynard retires in disgust.

Such 'animal stories' are, of course, of great antiquity. See the remarks
in Jacobs' edition of Caxton's 'Fables of Aesop,' vol. i. 253. Caxton's
fable 'Of the foxe and of the cocke' is the third fable in Book V. A
similar story, entitled 'A Fox and a Divining Cock,' occurs in the Fables
of Æsop, by Sir Roger L'Estrange. It is needless to pursue the subject.

§ 51. EPILOGUE TO THE NONNE PREESTES TALE. These characteristic lines are
obviously genuine, but are only extant in three MSS. (footnote to vol. iv.
p. 289). The use of the word 'another' in the last line shews that they
were composed with the view of being used as a Prologue to some Tale, but
that the author had not, at the moment, decided what Tale was to come next.
This point was, after all, never settled; and hence there is nothing to
shew what was to follow. This brings us, of necessity, to the conclusion of
Group B.

In the old black-letter editions, which _retain_ this Epilogue, it is
followed by the Manciple's Prologue. But this cannot be right, for there (H
5) the Host does not address 'another,' but the whole company. One of the
three MSS. which retain this Epilogue (Addit. 5140) reads 'the Nunne'
instead of 'another,' because the next Tale in the MS. is that of the
Second Nun. This also is unsuitable, for the Host does not introduce that
Tale at all.

Tyrwhitt introduces a row of asterisks after this Epilogue, to shew that
there is no connexion with the following Tale.


GROUP C.

§ 52. THE SPURIOUS PROLOGUE TO THE PHISICIENS TALE. This Tale has _no_
genuine Prologue, and some MSS., including E., do not contain one. In MS.
Dd. is the rubric: 'Here endeth the Frankeleins Tale, and biginneth the
Phisiciens Tale _without a Prologe_.' In the best MSS., it follows the
Frankeleins Tale; and such is, in my belief, its proper position. This
arrangement was arbitrarily altered by Dr. Furnivall, in order, I suppose,
to emphasize the fact that the relative order of the Groups may be altered
at pleasure; but this might have been understood without forcible
dislocation; and I think that no good has been effected by it. I have been
obliged to follow suit, but I wish to make a note that the right order of
the Groups is A, B, D, E, F, C, G, H, I.

On the supposition that the Phisicien follows the Frankeleyn, Tyrwhitt
inserted here a short Prologue of six lines, merely to fill up the gap,
without accepting it as genuine. These six lines he found in _one_ MS.
only, viz. in MS. Harl. 7735; and I have reprinted them from his edition in
the foot-note to vol. iv. p. 289.

In most MSS. the original position of the Tales has been altered, so as to
make the Phisicien follow the Chanouns Yeman; and this is the arrangement
in the black-letter editions. Two spurious Prologues have been written to
connect these Tales; both being very bad. One of these appears in the black
letter editions; and I here give it, from the edition of 1532.

  Whan this yeman his tale ended had
  Of this false chanon, which was so bad,
  Our Hoste gan say, 'truely and certayne,
  This preest was begyled, sothe for to sayne,
  He wenyng for to be a phylosopher,                                      5
  Tyl he right no golde lefte in his cofer.
  And sothly, this preest had a lither[120] iape;
  This cursed chanon put in his hoode an ape.
  But al this passe I ouer as now.
  Sir Doctour of Phisyke, yet I pray you,                                10
  Tel vs a tale of some honest matere.'
 'It shal be done, if that ye wol it here,'
  Sayd this Doctour, and his tale bygan anon:
 'Now good men (quod he) herkeneth euerychon.'

It will be seen that lines 7-9 are imitated from B 1629, 1630, and 1633;
and lines 9-14 coincide, very nearly, with the spurious Prologue of six
lines which I have already discussed.

The other Prologue is still worse; Mr. Wright has printed it, in a note,
from the Lansdowne MS., and I here reproduce it.

 'Now trewly,' quod oure Oste, 'this is a prati tale;
  For litel merveile it is that thou lokest so pale,
  Sethen thou hast medeled with so mony thinges;
  With bloweinge att the cole to melte bothe brochez and ringes,
  And other many Iewels, dar I undertake,                                 5
  And that thi lorde couthe us tel, if we might him overtake.
  But lat him go a devel waye, the compaigny is never the wers;
  And al suche fals harlotes, I sette not be hem a kers.
  But latt pas overe nowe al thes subtilitees,
  And sume worthi man tel us summe veritees;                             10
  As ye, worschipful Maister of Phisike,
  Tellith us somme tale that is a cronyke,
  That we may of yowe leren sum witte.'
  Quod the Maister of Phisik, 'a tale that I finde writte
  In [a] cronyke passed of olde tyme;                                    15
  Herkeneth, for I wil tel it yow in rime.'

These lines are instructive, as shewing that we must not accept lines as
genuine merely because they occur in a MS. of some authority. And this
circumstance should warn us against the folly of accepting the genuineness
of such a poem as the 'Court of Love,' merely on the authority of the
edition of 1561, which is a third reprint of the edition by Thynne, with
arbitrary additions.

§ 53. THE PHISICIENS TALE. This is the well-known story of Virginia, which
Chaucer tells, as usual, in his own way. Although he appeals to Livy as his
author, he really follows the account in Le Roman de la Rose, ll. 5613-82;
which contains all the particulars which he introduces, except such as are
of his own invention. It is interesting to compare ll. 3-120 of this Tale,
which are practically Chaucer's own, with ll. 255-76, where he follows Jean
de Meun rather closely. In order to illustrate this, I give the whole
passage of the French text, from Méon's edition, lines 5613-82; t. ii. p.
74:--

      Comment Virginius plaida
      Devant Apius, qui jugea
      Que sa fille, à tout bien taillée,
      Fust tost à Claudius baillée.
  Ne fist bien Apius à pendre,
  Qui fist à son serjant emprendre
  Par faus tesmoings, fauce querele                                    5615

  Si cum dist Titus Livius[121]
  Qui bien set le cas raconter,
  Por ce qu'il ne pooit donter                                         5620

  Ne di li, ne de sa luxure.

  Ne puet pas sa fille deffendre,
  Ains li convient par force rendre,
  Et son cors livrer à hontage,                                        5655

      Et mieulx ainsi le voulut faire

      Puis le chief presenta au juge
      Qui en escheut en grant déluge.
  Car[128] il par amors, sans haine,

  Qu'en essil le fist envoier,                                         5680
  Et tuit cil condampnés moururent
  Qui tesmoingz de la cause furent.

We thus see that the remark 'as seith the storie,' in C 258, simply
translates the French--'selonc l'estoire.' It is to be regretted that
Chaucer was unacquainted with Livy's version; see Lounsbury, Studies in
Chaucer, ii. 283. Gower (ed. Pauli, iii. 264) tells the same story; but I
find no points of close resemblance, and many of divergence.

§ 54. WORDS OF THE HOST TO THE PHISICIEN AND THE PARDONER. These 'Words'
connect the Phisiciens Tale with that of the Pardoner. There are some
curious variations in the copies, which suggest that some alterations were
here made by the author. The chief variations are the following.

C 289. E. Hn. fals cherl and; Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. cursed theef.

C 290. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. sham(e)ful; Ln. Hl. schendful.

C 291, 2. E. Hn. Pt. _wholly vary from_ Cp. Ln. Hl.; see footnote in vol.
iv. p. 299.

C 297-8. E. Hn. Pt. _omit these lines._

C 299, 300. Hl. (_and others_) _omit these lines._

I suppose that lines C 297-8, omitted in E. Hn., are a later (genuine)
insertion. And perhaps the readings _cursed theef_ and _schendful_ are also
corrections. But I follow MS. E. as the best guide, inserting 297-8 (as in
the Six-text edition), that they may not be lost.

§ 55. PROLOGUE OF THE PARDONERS TALE. This is really a preamble; and the
Tale itself has a long digression from the main subject. The portrait of
the Pardoner, as here painted by himself, is historically valuable and
minutely accurate; see the paper on 'Chaucer's Pardoner and the Pope's
Pardoners,' by Dr. J. J. Jusserand, in Essays on Chaucer, p. 423 (Chaucer
Society). The descriptions by Chaucer, Langland, Heywood (who plagiarises
Chaucer mercilessly), and Sir David Lyndsay are, in this essay, supported
by extracts from a papal letter by Boniface IX, written in 1390; by
statements made by Richard d'Angerville, bp. of Durham, given in the
Registrum Palatinum Dunelmense, iii. 325 (Rolls Series); and by extracts
from Wilkins, Concilia, ii. 747, iii. 84, 131, 365. There is nothing to
shew that the picture is unfair or overdrawn.

It may well be compared with one of the Tales in Boccaccio's Decamerone,
Day 6, Nov. 10, which is given in full in a cheap reprint of selections
from this work, edited by Prof. H. Morley, according to an English version
made in the time of James I. There is nothing to shew that Chaucer had read
this story; and, as has often been remarked above, he seems to have been
unacquainted with the Decamerone. Some account of this Tale, with remarks,
is given in Dunlop's History of Fiction, chap. vii. The hero of it is a
certain friar Cipolla (i.e. Onion), whose account of himself is amusing.
'He gave a long account (says Dunlop) of his travels as far as India, and
told how on his return he had visited the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had
shewn him innumerable relics; among others, a lock of the hair of the
seraph that appeared to St. Francis, a paring of the cherub's nail, a few
of the rays of the blessed star that guided the Magi in the east, the
jaw-bone of Lazarus,' &c. He adds: 'This tale of Boccaccio drew down the
censure of the Council of Trent, and is the one which gave the greatest
umbrage to the church. The author has been defended by his commentators, on
the ground that he did not intend to censure the respectable orders of
friars, but to expose those wandering mendicants who supported themselves
by imposing on the credulity of the people; that he did not mean to
ridicule the sacred relics of the church, but those which were believed so
in consequence of the fraud and artifice of monks.' But it must have been
hard to draw this line. In the note to C 349, I have drawn attention to
Heywood's close plagiarism from Chaucer, in the passage from the Four P.'s,
printed in the note to l. 701 of Morris's edition of Chaucer's Prologue;
also to Sir David Lyndsay's Satyre of the Three Estates, ll. 2037-2121.

§ 56. THE PARDONERES TALE. A considerable part of this Tale is taken up
with a digression; the Tale itself is told simply and well, occupying ll.
463-484, 661-894. Mr. Wright remarks: 'This beautiful moral story appears
to have been taken from a Fabliau, now lost, but of which the mere outline
is preserved [as first noted by Tyrwhitt] in the Cento Novelle Antiche,
Nov. lxxxii, as well as the story itself by Chaucer.' Dunlop, in his
History of Fiction, p. 203, says: 'It is evident from the title of the
Cento Novelle _Antiche_, that it was not a new and original production, but
a compilation of stories already current in the world. The collection was
made towards the end of the thirteenth century, and was formed from
episodes in Romances of chivalry; the Fabliaux of the French Trouveurs; the
ancient chronicles of Italy; recent incidents; or jests and repartees
current by oral tradition. That the stories derived from these sources were
compiled by different authors, is evident from the great variety of style;
but who those authors were, is still a problem in the literary annals of
Italy.' The story is not exactly the same in all the editions of the Cento
Novelle; and two different forms of it have been printed by Dr. Furnivall,
in his Originals and Analogues (Chaucer Soc.), Pt. ii. pp. 131-133. Of
these, the former is from the edition of 1525, with the title Le Ciento
Novelle Antike, where it appears as Nov. lxxxiii. It is very brief, and to
this effect. As Christ was walking with His disciples through a wild
country, they suddenly espied some bright golden piastres, and said, 'Let
us take some of these for our use.' But Christ reproved them, warning them
that they would soon see the fatal effects of avarice. Soon after, two men
found the gold; and one of them went to fetch a mule to carry it off,
whilst the other remained to guard it. On his return with the mule, the
former offered to his companion two loaves which he had bought for him. The
latter refused at the moment, and shortly afterwards took an opportunity of
stabbing the other as he chanced to be stooping down. He then took the two
loaves, gave one to the mule, and ate the other himself. The loaves were
poisoned; and man and mule fell dead. Then our Lord, passing by once more,
pointed out to His disciples the three dead bodies.

The other version is from the edition of 1572, entitled Libro di Novelle,
et di bel Parlar Gentile; where it is Nov. lxxxii. This is much more like
Chaucer's story, and is occasionally quoted in the Notes as the 'Italian
text.' Dr. Furnivall's analysis of the story is as follows:--

'A hermit lying down in a cave, sees there much gold. At once he runs away,
and meets three robbers. They see no one chasing the hermit, and ask him
what he is running away from. "Death, which is chasing me." "Where is he?
shew him us." "Come with me, and I will." The hermit takes them to the
cave, and shews them Death--the gold. They laugh at him, and make great
joy, and say, "The hermit is a fool." Then the three robbers consult as to
what they shall do. The second proposes that one shall go to the town, buy
bread and wine and all things needful; but the crafty Devil puts into the
heart of the robber who goes to the town, that he shall feed himself,
poison his mates, and then have all the treasure, and be the richest man in
that country. Meantime, the other robbers plot to murder their mate as soon
as he comes back with the bread and wine, and then share the treasure.
Their mate returns from the city, and they murder him at once. Then they
eat the food he has brought, and both fall dead. Thus doth our Lord God
requite traitors. The robbers found death. The wise man fled, and left the
gold free.'

As the original is not long, I here reprint it, for the reader's
convenience:--

'Qui conta d'uno Romito che andando per un luogo foresto trouo molto grande
Tesoro.

'Andando vn giorno vn Romito per vn luogo foresto: si trouò vna grandissima
grotta, laquale era molo celata, et ritirandosi verso là per riposarsi,
pero che era assai affaticato; come e' giunse alla grotta si la vide in
certo luogo molto tralucere, impercio che vi hauea molto oro: e si tosto
come il conobbe, incontanente si partio, et comincio a correre per lo
deserto, quanto e' ne potea andare. Correndo cosi questo Romito s'intoppo
in tre grandi scherani, liquali stauano in quella foresta per rubare chi
unque vi passaua. Ne gia mai si erano accorti, che questo oro vi fosse. Hor
vedendo costoro, che nascosti si stauano, fuggir cosi questo huomo, non
hauendo persona dietro che 'l cacciasse, alquanto hebbero temenza, ma pur
se li pararono dinanzi per sapere perche fuggíua, che di cio molto sí
marauígliauano. Ed elli rispose et disse: "Fratelli miei, io fuggo la
morte, che mi vien dietro cacciando mi." Que' non vedendo ne huomo, ne
bestia, che il cacciasse, dissero: "Mostraci chi ti caccia: et menaci cola
one ella è." Allhora il Romito disse loro, "venite meco, et mostrerollaui,"
pregandoli tutta via che non andassero ad essa, impercio che elli per se la
fuggia. Ed eglino volendola trouare, per vedere come fosse fatta, nol
domandouano di altro. Il Romito vedendo che non potea piu, et hauendo paura
di loro, gli condusse alla grotta, onde egli s'era partito, e disse loro,
"Qui è la morte, che mi cacciaua," et mostra loro l'oro che u' era, ed
eglino il conobbero incontanente, et molto si cominciarano a rallegrare, et
a fare insieme grande sollazzo. Allhora accommiatarono questo buono huomo;
et egli sen'ando per i fatti suoi: et quelli cominciarono a dire tra loro,
come elli era semplice persona. Rimasero questi scherani tutti e tre
insieme, a guardare questo hauere, e incominciarono a ragionare quello che
voleano fare. L'uno rispuose et disse: "A me pare, da che Dio ci ha dato
cosi alta ventura, che noi non ci partiamo di qui, insino a tanto che noi
non ne portiamo tutto questo hauere." Et l'altro disse: "non facciamo cosi;
l' vno di noi ne tolga alquanto, et vada alla cittade et vendalo, et rechi
del pane et del vino, et di quello che ci bisogna, e di cio s'ingegni il
meglio che puote: faccia egli, pur com' elli ci fornisca." A questo
s'accordarono tutti e tre insieme. Il Demonio ch'è ingegnoso, e reo
d'ordinare di fare quanto male e puote, mise in cuori a costui che andaua
alla citta per lo fornimento, "da ch'io sarò nella cittade" (dicea fra se
medesimo) "io voglio mangiare et bere quanto mi bisogna, et poi fornirmi di
certe cose delle quali io ho mestiere hora al presente: et poi auuelenero
quello che io porto a miei compagni: si che, da ch elli saranno morti
amendue, si saro io poi Signore di tutto quello hauere, et secondo che mi
pare egli è tanto, che io saio poi il piu ricco huomo di tutto questo paese
da parte d'hauere:" et come li venne in pensiero, cosi fece. Prese viuanda
per se quanta gli bisogno, et poi tutta l'altra auuelenoe, e cosi la porto
a que suoi compagni. Intanto ch'ando alla cittade secondo che detto hauemo:
se elli pensoe et ordinoe male per uccidere li suoi compagni, accio che
ogni cosa li rimanesse: quelli pensaro di lui non meglio ch'elli di loro,
et dissero tra loro: "Si tosto come questo nostro compagno tornera col pane
et col vino, et con l'altre cose che ci bisognano, si l'uccideremo, et poi
mangeremo quanto uorremo, e sara poi tra noi due tutto questo grande
hauere. Et come meno parti ne saremo, tanto n'haueremo maggior parte
ciascuno di noi." Hor viene quelli, che era ito alla cittade a comperare le
cose che bisognaua loro. Tornato a suoi compagni incontanente che 'l
videro, gli furono addosso con le lancie et con le coltella, et l'uccisero.
Da che l'hebbero morto, mangiarono di quello che egli hauea recato: et si
tosto come furono satolli, amendue caddero morti: et cosi morirono tutti e
tre: che l' vno vccise l'altro si come vdito hauete, et non hebbe l'hauere:
et cosi paga Domenedio li traditori, che egli andarono caendo la morte, et
in questo modo la trouarono, et si come ellino n'erano degni. Et il saggio
sauiamente la fuggio, e l'oro rimase libero come di prima.'

Dr. Furnivall has also reprinted Novella xlii. from the Novellae of
Morlinus, ed. Naples, 1520 (reprinted at Paris in 1799); corrected by the
Paris edition of Morlinus' Works, 1855. The story is very brief, being as
follows:--

'De illis qui, in Tiberi reperto thesauro, ad inuicem conspirantes, ueneno
et ferro periere.

'Magus magico susurro in Tiberi delitere thesaurum, quadam in cauea
spirituum reuelatione cognouit: quo reperto, cum magnum siclorum cumulum
aspiceret, communi uoto pars sociorum proximum oppidum seu castellum,
epulas aliasque res comparaturi, accedunt: ceteri uero copiosum interea
ignem instruunt, thesaurumque custodiunt. Dumque in castellum conuenissent,
radice malorum cupiditate affecti, ut consocios thesauri parte priuarent,
diro ueneno illos interimere statuerunt: cum dicto, in caupona epulantes,
ebrii ac uino sepulti, aliquatenus moram fecere. In Tiberi expectantes
atque esurientes, consocios de mora incussabant: Iouemque adiurauerunt,
repedantes ex oppido atque castello et uita et thesauri parte priuare.
Sicque ad inuicem conspirantes, non multo post adueniunt ex pago illi,
uinarios utres, pullos, pisces, aliaque tucetosi saporis pulmentaria atque
prelectum hircum ferentes. Quibus obuiam dederunt ieiuni, illosque omnes
morti imparatos incautosque insecauere atque crudeli strage perdiderunt.
Pone sumptis cibariis diro ueneno tabefactis, insigni iocunditate gnauiter
cuncta ministrare incipiunt; alter uerrit, alter sternit, pars coquit,
atque tuceta concinnat. Pone omnibus scitule appositis, ac mensa largiter
instructa edere ceperunt, omniaque ingurgitauerunt. Commodum ex eis mensa
erectis erant (_sic_) quod, morte preuenti, cum sociis uitam fato
reddentes, sub elemento mortui et sepulti remansere.

'Nouella indicat: nec esse de malo cogitandum: nam quod quis seminat,
metit.'

It has lately been discovered that this striking story is unquestionably of
Asiatic origin. Numerous analogous stories have been collected and printed
for the Chaucer Society by Mr. W. A. Clouston. At pp. 417-436 of these
'Originals and Analogues' is printed a Buddhist original of great
antiquity, together with varying versions in several languages, viz.
Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, and Tibetan. Versions also occur in French,
Italian, German, and Portuguese.

The Buddhist story is one entitled 'Vedabbha Játaka,' being the 48th story
in Fausböll's edition of the Páli text of the Játaka-book. Mr. Clouston
says (p. 418): 'The first to point out the identity of the Pardoner's Tale
with one of those Buddhist "Birth"-stories was the Rev. Dr. Richard Morris,
in the Contemporary Review, May, 1881, vol. xxxix. p. 738, and afterwards
two other scholars each made the same discovery independently: Mr. H. T.
Francis, in The Academy, Dec. 22, 1883, and Prof. C. H. Tawney, in the
Journal of Philology, 1883, vol. xii. pp. 203-8. The Bishop of Colombo, in
the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1884,
published translations of the first 50 Játakas, the 48th of which, as
already stated, is the Vedabbha Játaka.' Mr. Clouston then gives a complete
translation of this Játaka, from which I extract, for comparison, a few
sentences:--

'But those two men [two robbers] deftly carried off that wealth, and hid it
in a thicket near a village, and one remained guarding it, sword in hand,
while the other took some rice and went off to the village to get it
cooked. Truly this passion of avarice is the root of destruction[129], for
the one who was guarding the wealth said to himself: "When my fellow
returns, this wealth will have to be divided into two portions, so I had
better kill him with a sword-cut as soon as he arrives." So he made ready
his sword, and remained watching for his return. The other said to himself:
"This wealth will have to be divided into two portions so I had better put
poison in the rice, and give it to my fellow to eat and so kill him, and
take all the wealth for myself." Accordingly as soon as the rice was
cooked, he ate all he wanted, and put poison in the rest, and set out with
it in his hand. No sooner had he put the rice down than the other cut him
in two with his sword and threw his body into a tangled thicket. Then he
ate the rice, and fell dead on the spot.'

The Persian Version follows, from a poem in the 'Book of Calamities,' made
in the twelfth century by Ferídu-'d-Dín 'Attár, a celebrated philosopher
and poet. In this version, as in Chaucer, there are _three_ men; one of
them goes to the town to buy bread, some of which he eats, and poisons the
rest. The other two slay him on his return, eat the poisoned bread, and
perish.

Of the Arabic versions, one occurs in the Breslau edition of the Book of
the Thousand and One Nights (Burton's Supplementary Nights, vol. i p.250).

The Kashmírí version is given in Mr. Knowles' Dictionary of Kashmírí
Proverbs and Sayings, Bombay, 1885, p. 45. Here there are four men, two of
whom conspire against the other two, and slay them with axes; but
afterwards eat the poisoned bread which the latter couple had prepared for
them.

I must refer the reader to Mr. Clouston's essay for further particulars.

I must not omit to notice here the instances in which Chaucer has borrowed
some of his moral reflexions from the treatise De Contemptu Mundi, by Pope
Innocent, which has already been discussed above; see § 36. Dr. E. Köppel
has noticed the following, in the Archiv für das Studium der neueren
Sprachen, ed. L. Herrig, vol. 84, p. 411.

C 483, 4. 'Propterea dicit apostolus: Nolite inebriari vino, in quo est
luxuria:' lib. ii. cap. 19.

C 505-7; 491. 'Gula paradisum clausit; decollauit Baptistam:' lib. ii. cap.
18.

C 513-6; 521-3. 'Inde non salus et sanitas, sed morbus et mors. Audi super
hoc sententiam Sapientis: "Noli auidus esse in omni epulatione, et non te
effundas super omnem escam. In multis enim escis erit infirmitas; et
propter crapulam multi perierunt." "Esca uentri, et uenter escis; Deus
autem et hunc et hanc destruet":' lib. ii. cap. 17.

C 517-520[130]. 'Nunc autem gulosis non sufficiunt fructus arborum, non
genera leguminum, non radices herbarum, non pisces maris, non bestiae
terrae, non aues coeli.' ... 'Tam breuis est gulae uoluptas, ut spatio loci
uix sit quatuor digitorum,' &c.: lib. ii. cap. 17.

C 534-6. 'Quanto sunt delicatoria cibaria, tanto foetidiora sunt stercora.
Turpius egerit, qui turpiter ingerit, superius et inferius horribilem
flatum exprimens, et abominabilem sonum emittens:' lib. ii. cap. 18.

C 537-546. 'Quaeruntur pigmenta, comparantur aromata ... quae studiose
coquuntur arte coquorum.... Alius contundit et colat, alius confundit et
conficit, substantiam conuertit in accidens ... ut fastidium reuocet
appetitum, ad irritandum gulam:' lib. ii. cap. 17.

C 551-2; 560-1. 'Quid turpius ebrioso? cui fetor in ore ... cui facies
transformatur? "Nullum enim secretum, ubi regnat ebrietas":' lib. ii. cap.
19. Cf. Man of Lawes Tale, B 771-2, 776-7. See above, p. 408.

All these passages are probably versified from Chaucer's lost prose
translation of Innocent's treatise. Observe that all the passages quoted
lie close together, viz. in lib. ii. capp. 17-19.

A modernized version of the Pardoner's Tale was brought out by the Rev. Wm.
Lipscomb, in 1792; and another version, made with some spirit, but far
inferior to the original, will be found among Leigh Hunt's Poems, with the
title 'Death and the Ruffians.'


GROUP D.

§ 57. THE WIFE OF BATH'S PROLOGUE. In some MSS., as in E. and Cm., this
Prologue follows the Man of Lawes Tale, but without any connecting link. In
others, as in Pt. and in the black-letter editions, it follows the
Marchants Tale; and rarely, as in Cp. and Ln., it follows the Squieres
Tale; but in no case are there any _genuine_ lines to link it with what
precedes. Two spurious prologues are, however, found. The former occurs in
MS. Royal 18 C. II., and in MSS. Laud 739 and Barlow 20 (in the Bodleian
Library). Tyrwhitt prints it from the first of these, 'to justify himself
for not inserting them in the text'; as follows:--

  Oure oost gan tho to loke[n] up anon:
 'Gode men,' quod he, 'herkeneth everichone;
  As evere mote I drynke wyn or ale,
  This Marchaunt hath itold a mery tale,
  Howe Ianuarie hadde a lither Iape;                                      5
  His wyf put in his hood an ape.
  But hereoff I wil leve off as now.
  Dame Wyf of Bathe,' quod he, 'I pray[e] you,
  Telle us a tale now nexte after this.'
 'Sir Oost,' quod she, 'so god my soule blis,                            10
  As I fully therto wil consente;
  And also it is myn hole entente
  To done yow alle disporte as that I can.
  But holde me excused: I am a woman.
  I can not reherse as these clerkes kunne.'                             15
  And right anon she hath hir tale bygunne.
      Experience, &c.

Here ll. 5 and 6 are imitated from B 1629 and 1630.

The Lansdowne MS. subjoins eight spurious lines at the end of the Squieres
Tale, and prefixes to the Wife's Tale the four lines that follow:--

  Than shortly ansewarde the wife of Bathe,
  And swore a wonder grete hathe,
 'Be goddes bones, I wil tel next;
  I will nouht glose, bot saye the text.'

Here _hathe_ (for _aath_) means 'oath,' and is a purely Northern form.

As to the Prologue itself, Wright remarks:--'The Wife of Bath's Prologue
may be considered as a separate Tale, and belongs to a class of which there
are several examples among the literature of the middle ages. One of the
latest is "The twa Maryit Wemen and the Wedo" [Widow], of William Dunbar.
The popular literature of what is commonly looked upon as the age of
chivalry shews us that the female character was then estimated at the
lowest possible rate.'

Tyrwhitt's remarks on this Prologue are excellent. 'The extraordinary
length of it, as well as the vein of pleasantry that runs through it, is
very suitable to the character of the speaker. The greatest part must have
been of Chaucer's own invention, though we may plainly see that he had been
reading the popular invectives against marriage and women in general; such
as the Roman de la Rose; Valerius ad Rufinum de non ducenda uxore; and
particularly, Hieronymus contra Iouinianum.' Of the last of these he
says:--'The holy Father, by way of recommending celibacy, has exerted all
his learning and eloquence (and he certainly was not deficient in either)
to collect together and aggravate whatever he coud find to the prejudice of
the female sex. Among other things he has inserted his own translation
(probably) of a long extract from what he calls "Liber aureolus Theophrasti
de nuptiis."

'Next to him in order of time was the treatise entitled Epistola Valerii ad
Rufinum de non ducenda uxore (MS. Reg. 12 D. III). It has been printed, for
the similarity of its sentiments, I suppose, among the works of St. Jerome,
though it is evidently of a much later date. Tanner (from Wood's MS. Coll)
attributes it to Walter Map (Bib. Brit., v. MAP). I should not believe it
to be older; as John of Salisbury, who has treated of the same subject in
his Polycraticus, lib. viii. cap. 11, does not appear to have seen it.

'To these two books Jean de Meun has been obliged for some of his severest
strokes in his Roman de la Rose; and Chaucer has transfused the
quintessence of all the three works, upon the subject of Matrimony, into
his Wife of Bathes Prologue and Merchant's Tale[131].'

Dr. Köppel has shewn that, in _one_ passage (D 278), there is a trace of a
quotation from Pope Innocent's treatise De Contemptu Mundi, lib. i. c. 18.
This passage introduces the word 'smoke,' which is not in the wording of
Prov. xxvii. 15, the ultimate authority for the quotation. Similarly, when
Innocent cites the same text, he introduces the word _fumus_.

§ 58. THE TALE OF THE WYF OF BATHE. The various Tales analogous to this
have been discussed by Mr. W. A. Clouston, in the 'Originals and Analogues'
published by the Chaucer Society in 1887, p. 483. Mr. Clouston calls the
Tales of this class 'The Knight and the Loathly Lady.' He begins by
observing that 'Gower anticipated the Wife of Bath's characteristic Tale by
a few years[132] in his Confessio Amantis, but there seems no good reason
to suppose Chaucer to have borrowed from his friend, the two versions
differing so very considerably in details; and it is probable that both
poets drew their materials independently from a French source, or sources.'
He then quotes Gower's tale, from MS. Harl. 3869; cf. Pauli's edition, i.
89-104. Here the hero is named Florent and is supposed to be the
nephew[133] of the emperor Claudius. Florent has slain one Branchus, whose
grandmother plots a plan of revenge. She sends for Florent, offering him a
full pardon if he can answer a certain question; but if he fails, he must
forfeit his life. To this he agrees, and is allowed a term of days for the
solution of the question. The question is--'What do all women most desire?'

After much vain enquiry, Florent finds a loathly old woman, who tells him
that she can save him from death; but if she does this, he must marry her;
and to this he desperately consents. She tells him that women desire
sovereignty, and to have all their will. The answer is correct; his life is
saved, and he must perform his promise. He weds her, and is at last
persuaded that he ought to kiss her; whereupon she is transformed into a
young girl, of eighteen years of age. She explains that she had been
bewitched, and his courtesy had broken the charm.

A similar story is the subject of the 'Weddynge of Syr Gawen and Dame
Ragnell,' printed by Sir F. Madden in his 'Syr Gawayne,' from MS. Rawlinson
C. 86. The outline of it is given by Prof. Child in his English and
Scottish Ballads, Boston (U. S.), 1884, Part ii., pp. 289, 290, and is
reprinted by Mr. Clouston. In this story, it is King Arthur who, to save
his life, undertakes to solve, within a twelvemonth, the question--'What do
women love most?' Soon after, Arthur tells his adventure to Sir Gawain, who
is willing to help him. Gawain meets a hideous hag who offers to tell him
the answer on the usual terms; her name is Dame Ragnell. Gawain learns the
answer, imparts it to Arthur, and kisses Dame Ragnell, who is transformed
into the fairest creature he had ever seen.

This is the story on which is founded the ballad of the Marriage of Sir
Gawaine, a fragmentary piece printed in the Percy Folio MS., ed. Hales and
Furnivall, i. 103.

Another version, perhaps older than either of the foregoing, is the Border
Ballad of King Henrie, printed by Scott in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border. William Tytler's version of this ballad was adapted by Lewis for
his Tales of Wonder, with the new title of 'Courteous King Jamie'; vol. ii.
453. Mr. Clouston adds:--'A similar ballad, "Of a Knight and a Fair
Virgin," is found in Johnson's Crown Garland of Golden Roses, printed about
1600. And Voltaire has followed Chaucer in his tale Ce qui plaît aux Dames.

'Scott, in his prefatory note to the ballad of King Henrie, after referring
to its resemblance to the Marriage of Sir Gawaine and the Wife of Bath's
Tale, cites what he considers as "the original" [viz. an Icelandic version]
from Torfeus (Hrolffi Krakii Hist., Hafn. 1715, p. 49).'

Another Icelandic version is given by Clouston (from Prof. Child), in the
form of an abstract.

Another version follows, from the Gaelic, taken from the story of The
Daughter of King Under-Waves; given in Campbell's Popular Tales of the West
Highlands, iii. 403.

A similar notion occurs in Mandeville's Travels, ed. Halliwell, chap. iv.
pp. 23-26. His story is to the effect that in the Isle of Lango is to be
found the daughter of Ypocras (Hippocrates), who has been transformed into
a loathsome Dragon, a hundred fathoms long. 'But whan a Knyghte comethe,
that is so hardy to kisse hire, he schalle not dye: but he schalle turne
the Damysele in-to hire righte Forme and kyndely Schapp; and he schal be
Lord of alle the Contreyes and Iles aboveseyd.' It is disappointing to find
that no one ever performed the task; so that, in fact, the lady remains a
dragon to the present day.

Mr. Clouston adds a Turkish Analogue from a story-book entitled Phantasms
from the Presence of God, written in 1796-7, by 'Ali 'Aziz Efendi, the
Cretan; and refers to similar ideas found in Sanskrit stories. He concludes
by saying:--'Legends similar to the tale of the Knight and the Loathly Lady
seem to be of universal currency and of very ancient date. Have we not all
listened to them in the nursery, and been especially charmed with the tale
of the Frog-Prince? And there are several parallels to it among the nations
of South Africa.' He appends two Kaffir analogues from Theal's Kaffir
Folk-Lore.

The Wife of Bath's Tale has been retold by Dryden, in a way peculiarly his
own. If compared with the original, it suffers sadly by the comparison. The
poet Gay wrote a comedy called The Wife of Bath, which appeared in 1713. A
later edition, 'revised and altered by the author,' appeared in 1730.

§ 59. THE FRIAR'S PROLOGUE. This is closely linked with the preceding tale,
and is chiefly remarkable for the Friar's outburst against the Somnour,
which shews such rancour that even the Host interferes. As Tyrwhitt here
notes--'The Regular Clergy, and particularly the Mendicant Friars, affected
a total exemption from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, except that of the
Pope, which made them exceedingly obnoxious to the Bishops, and of course
to all the inferior orders of the national hierarchy.'

§ 60. THE FRERES TALE. Warton, in his History of Eng. Poetry (ed. Hazlitt,
i. 302), after speaking of the collection of stories in the Gesta
Romanorum, tells us that 'rather before the year 1480, a Latin volume was
printed in Germany, written by John Herolt, a Dominican friar of Basle,
better known by the adopted and humble appellation of Discipulus, and who
flourished about the year 1418.' The first part of this work consists of
sermons. The second part is 'a Promptuary or ample repository of examples
for composing sermons,' and contains 'a variety of little histories.' Among
these is one analogous to Chaucer's Freres Tale.

The Latin story was first printed by Mr. T. Wright in the Archæologia, vol.
xxxii., and again in Originals and Analogues, Chaucer Soc., 1872, p. 105,
from MS. Cotton, Cleop. D. 8, leaf 110; and is as follows:--

NARRATIO DE QUODAM SENESCALLO SCELEROSO.

Erat uir quidam Senescallus et placitator, pauperum calumpniator, et
bonorum huiusmodi spoliator. Qui die quadam forum iudiciale causa
contencionis faciende et lucrandi adiuit. Cui quidam obuiauit in itinere
dicens ei: 'Quo uadis, et quid habes officii?'  Respondit primus: 'Uado
lucrari.' Et ait secundus: 'Ego tui similis sum. Eamus simul.' Primo
consenciente, dixit secundus ei: 'Quid est lucrum tuum?' Et ille:
'emolumentum pauperum, quamdiu aliquid habent, ut per lites, contenciones
et uexationes, siue iuste siue iniuste. Modo dixi tibi lucrum meum, unde
est. Die mihi, queso, unde est et tuum?' Respondit secundus dicens:
'Quicquid sub maledictione traditur diabolo, computo mihi pro lucro.' Risit
primus, et derisit secundum, non intelligens quod esset diabolus.

Paulo post cum transirent per ciuitatem, audierunt quemdam pauperem
maledicere cuidam uitulo quem duxit ad uendendum, quia indirecte ibat. Item
audierunt consimilem de muliere fustigante puerum suum. Tunc ait primus ad
secundum: 'Ecce potes lucrari, si uis. Tolle puerum et uitulum.' Respondit
secundus: 'Non possum, quia non maledicunt ex corde.'

Cum uero paululum processissent, pauperes euntes versus iudicium, uidentes
illium Senescallum, ceperunt omnes unanimiter maledictiones in ipsum
ingerere. Et dixit secundus ad primum: 'Audis quid isti dicunt?' 'Audio,'
inquit, 'sed nichil ad me.' Et dixit secundus: 'Isti maledicunt ex corde,
et te tradunt diabolo; et ideo meus eris.' Qui statim ipsum arripiens, cum
eo disparuit.

A similar story is printed in a Selection of Latin Stories, edited by Mr.
T. Wright for the Percy Society, vol. viii. p. 70. It is entitled 'De
Aduocato et Diabolo,' and was taken from the printed Promptuarium
Exemplorum, compiled in the early part of the fifteenth century. It is
reprinted in the Originals and Analogues, p. 106, and I here quote Dr.
Furnivall's abstract of it.

'A grasping lawyer, out to gather prey, met the Devil in the form of a man,
and could not get quit of him. A poor man, angry with his perverse pig,
said: "Devil take you!" But as he did not say it from his heart, the Devil
could not take the pig; nor could he a child, to which its mother said:
"Devil take you!" When, however, some townsmen saw the lawyer coming, they
all cried out: "May the Devil take you!" And, as they did it from the
bottom of their hearts, the Devil carried the lawyer off; as his man bore
witness.'

This Tale furnishes an admirable example of Chaucer's method; the mere
outline of the story is little altered, but his mode of telling gives it a
new spirit, and quiet touches of humour are abundant throughout.

A modernised version of this Tale, by Jeremiah Markland, was included in
Ogle's 'Canterbury Tales of Chaucer modernized by several hands,' published
by Tonson in 1741. Another such version, by Leigh Hunt, was included in
Horne's 'Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernized,' published in 1841. See
Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, iii. 190, 217, 223.

§ 61. THE SOMNOUR'S PROLOGUE. The Freres Tale rouses the Somnour almost to
fury; and he begins by retorting that Friars have a peculiar knowledge of
hell, for obvious reasons; and emphasises his statement by a brief story,
which was probably a current popular joke. He then proceeds with his Tale.

§ 62. THE SOMNOURS TALE. The analogous French story was first pointed out
by M. Sandras, in his Étude sur Chaucer, 1859, p. 237. It is entitled Li
Dis de la Vescie a Prestre, the Story of the Priest's Bladder, and was
written by Jakes de Basiu, or Baisieux. It is printed in a collection
entitled Fabliaux ou Contes, Fables et Romans du xii^e et du xiii^e Siècle,
par Legrand D'Aussy; 1829; vol. iv. p. 18 of the Appendix. An analysis of
the story, in modern French, is given at p. 177 of the same.

The _Dis_ is reprinted among the Originals and Analogues, Chaucer Society,
1875, p. 137. I subjoin a very brief outline of it.

A Priest, dwelling near Antwerp, a wise man and a rich, falls ill, and is
about to die. He sends for his dean and his friends, to dispose of his
property. Two Jacobin friars come to visit him and to beg. The Priest
explains that all his property is settled. The friars insist on the merit
of giving to them above all others, and are very importunate. At last, to
quiet them, he tells them he will leave them a jewel for which he would not
take a thousand marks; and their Prior must come next day, to learn where
the jewel is kept.

Next day, five of the friars again visit the Priest, but leave the Prior at
home. The Priest says he will only reveal the secret in the presence of the
Sheriffs and the Mayor, who are duly sent for. On their arrival, the Priest
explains all about the cupidity and importunity of the two friars, and how,
in order to get rid of them, he promised to give them something which he
valued very much. He then reveals the secret, that the jewel is his own
bladder; and the Jacobins retire crest-fallen.

In the same volume of Fabliaux ou Contes, p. 184, M. Legrand d'Aussy says
that a somewhat similar story used to be told of the poet Jean de Meun,
who, it was said, left to the Jacobin friars some heavy coffers of
treasure, which were not to be opened till they had duly said a mass for
the repose of his soul. Of course the coffers were filled with pieces of
slate.

It is interesting to notice how Chaucer localises the story. He transfers
the scene from Antwerp to Holderness, just as, in the Reves Tale, he boldly
transfers it to Trumpington. The friar satirised in the Tale is clearly an
Englishman, and the whole is rendered definite and vivid.

In 1733, a Mr. Grosvenor wrote a sort of imitation of the Somnours Tale,
under the title of The Whimsical Legacy, as a contribution to Eustace
Budgell's periodical entitled The Bee. It is only a third of the length of
the original. It was reprinted by Ogle, in his Canterbury Tales Modernized,
in 1741. The poet Gay wrote another poor imitation, entitled An Answer to
the Sompner's Prologue in Chaucer, printed anonymously in Lintot's
Miscellany, entitled Poems on Several Occasions (1717), p. 147. See
Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, iii. 125, 190, 192.


GROUP E.

§ 63. THE CLERK'S PROLOGUE. This begins a new Group of Tales. There is
nothing to connect this Prologue with any of the rest of the Tales. It
usually follows the Somnours Tale, as in most MSS. and in the early
editions.

The Prologue, in the usual riming couplets, is evidently later than the
Tale, and was supplied at the time of revision. It contains an interesting
allusion to Petrarch, whose death took place in July, 1374; see remarks
upon the Tale itself below. The latter part of the Prologue describes
briefly the contents of the Latin Proem prefixed to Petrarch's tale.

§ 64. THE CLERKES TALE. Of this tale, the main part is a rather close
translation from Petrarch's De obedientia et fide uxoriâ Mythologia, as
explained in the Notes; and it must be added that Petrarch had it from
Boccaccio. It is the very last tale--the tenth tale of the tenth day--in
the Decamerone, written shortly after the year 1348. Whether Boccaccio
invented it or not can hardly be determined; for an expression of Petrarch,
to the effect that he had heard it 'many years' (multos annos) before 1373,
is not at all decisive on this point, as he may easily have _heard_ it
twenty years before then, even though he had never before _read_ the
Decamerone, as he himself asserts. There has been some unnecessary
mystification about the matter. Tyrwhitt wonders why Chaucer should have
owned an obligation to Petrarch rather than to Boccaccio; but a very
cursory examination shews the now undoubted fact, that Chaucer follows
Petrarch almost word for word in many passages, though Petrarch by no means
closely follows Boccaccio. In fact, ll. 41-55 settle the matter. The date
of Petrarch's version, though a little uncertain, seems to have been 1373;
and Chaucer himself tells us that he met Petrarch at Padua[134]. We may
therefore readily adopt Dr. Furnivall's suggestion, that 'during his
Italian embassy in 1373, Chaucer may have met Petrarch.' Only let us
suppose for a moment that Chaucer himself knew best, that he is not
intentionally and unnecessarily inventing his statements, and all
difficulty vanishes. We know that Chaucer was absent from England on the
king's business, visiting Florence and Genoa, from December 1, 1372, till
some time before November 22, 1373. We know that Petrarch's letter to
Boccaccio, really forming a preface to the tale of Griselda, and therefore
written shortly _after_ he had made his version of it, is dated in some
copies June 8, 1373, though in other copies no date appears. And we know
that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of
Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, _for the express
purpose of repeating it to friends_, before the idea of turning it into
Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met
at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of
mouth, either in Italian or French[135]; and that Chaucer shortly after
obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly
before him whilst making his own translation[136]. At this rate, the main
part of the Clerk's Tale was probably written in 1373 or early in
1374[137], and required but little revision to make it suitable for one of
the tales of the Canterbury series. The test of metre likewise suggests
that it was probably one of his early works. The closeness of the
translation also proves the same point. Chaucer, in his revised version,
adds the Prologue, containing an allusion to Petrarch's death (which took
place in 1374), and eulogises the great Italian writer according to his
desert. At the end of the translation, which terminates with l. 1162, he
adds two new stanzas, and the Envoy. The lateness of this (undramatic)
addition is proved at once by the whole tone of it, and, in particular, by
the mention of the Wife of Bath in l. 1170. The Envoy is a marvel of
rhythm, since, though it consists of thirty-six lines, it contains but
three rime-endings, viz. _-ence_, _-aille_, and _-inde_. Besides this
addition, there is yet one more, in the middle of the tale, viz. the two
stanzas in ll. 995-1008, as pointed out in the Notes; they are conspicuous
for their excellence.

The story of Griselda, as told by Boccaccio, together with Petrarch's Latin
version of it, and the letter of Petrarch to Boccaccio concerning it, are
all reprinted in the 'Originals and Analogues of some of Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales,' Part II, published for the Chaucer Society, and dated
(in advance) 1875. Were any additional proof needed that Chaucer had
Petrarch's version before him, it is supplied by the fact that numerous
quotations from that version are actually written in the margins of the
pages of the Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS., each in its proper place. All the
passages that are made clearer by a comparison with the Latin text are duly
considered in the Notes. Speaking of the story of Griselda, Warton remarks
that it 'soon became so popular in France, that the comedians of Paris
represented a mystery in French verse, entitled Le mystere de Griselidis
Marquis[e] de Saluces, in the year 1393. Before, or in the same year, the
French prose version in Le Ménagier de Paris was composed, and there is an
entirely different version in the Imperial library. Lydgate, almost
Chaucer's contemporary, in his poem entitled the Temple of Glass, among the
celebrated lovers painted on the walls of the Temple, mentions Dido, Medea
and Jason, Penelope, Alcestis, _Patient Griselda_[138], Belle Isoulde and
Sir Tristram, Pyramus and Thisbe, Theseus, Lucretia, Canace, Palamon, and
Emilia.' Elsewhere Warton remarks (Hist. Eng. Poetry, ed. Hazlitt, iv. 229,
note 3) that 'the affecting story of _Patient Grisild_ seems to have long
kept up its celebrity. In the books of the Stationers, in 1565, Owen Rogers
has a licence to print "a Ballat intituled the Songe of Pacyent Gressell
vnto hyr make" [husband]; Registr. A. fol. 132, b. Two ballads are entered
in 1565, "to the tune of pacyente Gressell"; ibid. fol. 135, a. In the same
year T. Colwell has licence to print The History of meke and pacyent
Gresell; ibid. fol. 139, a. Instances occur much lower.' See also Hazlitt's
Handbook of Early English Literature.

In Originals and Analogues, published by the Chaucer Society, 1887, p. 527,
there is an article by Mr. Clouston giving an abstract of an Early French
version of this story which was printed in Le Grand's Fabliaux ou Contes,
du XIII^e et du XIIII^e siècle, ed. 1781, tome ii. 232-252. Mr. Clouston
draws the conclusion that both the Latin version in Petrarch and the
Italian version in Boccaccio were taken from a common source closely
resembling this Early French _fabliau_. 'The differences,' he observes,
'between the French and Latin versions are few and immaterial. As Petrarch
plainly states that he was familiar with the tale long before he had read
it in the Decameron, we may, I think, safely conclude that he knew it from
a _fabliau_, which was probably also the source of Boccaccio's novel.'

Similar tales are not common in Asiatic literature; but 'in the earlier
literature of India,' says Mr. Clouston, 'before it could be affected by
baleful Muslim notions regarding women, there occur several notable tales
of faithful, virtuous, obedient wives.' One is the tale of a queen, as
given in the Kathá Sárit Ságara (Tawney's translation, vol. i. p. 355); see
the abstract by Mr. Clouston. Another faithful wife appears in Sitá, the
spouse of Ráma, in the great Hindú epic, the Rámayana; and again, in
Damayanti, wife of Nala, in the beautiful episode called the Tale of Nala,
in the great poem entitled the Mahábhárata.

Two English versions of the Tale of Griselda are printed in vol. iii. of
the Percy Society's publications. One is in prose, dated 1610, and is said
to have been 'written first in French'; the other, in ballad form, is said
to be 'translated out of Italian.'

There is a ballad called 'Patient Grissell,' in the Percy Folio MS., ed.
Hales and Furnivall, iii. 421; and there is one by Thomas Deloney in
Professor Child's English and Scottish Ballads, vol. iv. Professor Child
remarks that 'two plays upon the subject are known to have been written,
one of which (by Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton) has been printed by the
Shakespeare Society, while the other, an older production of the close of
Henry VIII's reign, is lost.' Pepys refers to the 'puppet-play' of Patient
Grizell in his Diary, Aug. 30, 1667. Butler, in his Hudibras (pt. i. c. 2.
772), couples Grizel with Job.

In Italy the story is so common that it is still often acted in marionette
theatres; it is to be had, moreover, in common chap-books, and a series of
cheap pictures representing various scenes in it may often be seen
decorating cottage-walls. (Notes and Queries, 5th S. i. 105, 255). The same
thing was done in England.

  We in the country do not scorn
  Our walls with ballads to adorn
  Of patient Grissel and the Lord of Lorn.'
             Ritson's Ancient Songs, i. xcviii.

Several scenes of the tale are well exhibited in an excellent picture by
Pinturicchio, in the National Gallery (London).

For remarks upon the conduct of the tale and the character of the heroine,
see Prof. Hales's criticisms in the Percy Folio MS., iii. 421, and in
Originals and Analogues of Chaucer, Part II, pp. 173-176. There are also a
few good remarks on it in Canterbury Tales from Chaucer, by J. Saunders,
ed. 1889, p. 308, where the author points out that, as the Marquis was
Griselda's feudal lord, she could but say 'yes' when asked to marry him,
the asking being a mere form; and that the spirit of chivalry appears in
her devotion of herself to his every wish.

§ 65. THE MERCHANT'S PROLOGUE. It seems to have been Chaucer's first
intention to end the Clerkes Tale at l. 1163. He then began writing a new
Prologue, but only finished one stanza of it. This stanza is given in the
footnote at p. 424 of vol. iv.[139] He then changed his mind, rejected this
stanza, and wrote (instead of it) the late addition to the Clerkes Tale
given on pp. 424-5, lines 1163-1212. The last line (l. 1212) ends
with--'care, and wepe, and wringe, and waille.' Then, with reference to
this line, he makes the Merchant's Prologue begin with the words '_Weping_,
and _wayling, care_,' &c. In this way, the Clerkes Tale and that of the
Marchant are indissolubly connected, as in the Ellesmere MS. and most
others. There is, however, one set of MSS. which _disconnects_ these Tales,
as explained in the Introduction to vol. iv. p. xxiii. This is the set
there marked D. Unfortunately, Thynne followed a MS. of this class, in
which the worst arrangement of the Tales occurs. Hence in all the
black-letter editions, the Tales are sadly out of order, and the Clerkes
Tale is wrongly followed by that of the Frankeleyn. This causes a breaking
up of Group F as well as of Group E, the Squieres Tale being followed by
that of the Marchant, as noted in § 69 below.

The close connexion between this Prologue and the preceding Tale is further
seen in the whole tenor of ll. 1213-39; note particularly the express
mention of _Grisildis_ in l. 1224.

In consequence of their dislocation of the order of the Tales, the
black-letter editions substitute the word _Marchant_ for _Frankeleyn_ in F
675 and 696, and even alter the ending of F 699, viz. 'quod the
frankeleyn,' into 'quod the marchant certeyn,' a forced alteration which is
obviously spurious. They then place F 673-708 before E 1213; which is an
extremely clumsy arrangement. Tyrwhitt put this matter right in his
edition, being here guided by the authority of the majority of the MSS.

§ 66. THE MARCHANTES TALE. This Tale is certainly a late addition. Dr.
Köppel has shewn[140] that several lines in this Tale are imitated from
Albertano of Brescia, so that it becomes clear that the Tale of Melibeus
(which is little else than a translation from that author) had already been
written before the Marchantes Tale was begun. This easily appears by
comparing the following passages: (_a_) E 1362-1374 with B 2287-91, where
Jacob, Judith, Abigail, and Hester are mentioned, in both passages, in the
same order: (_b_) E 1483-6 with B 2193: (_c_) E 2246-8 with B 2247, and E
2250 with B 2249: (_d_) E 2277-81 and 2286-90 with B 2266-70: (_e_) E 2365
with B 2167. Moreover, in two instances at least, Chaucer follows the Latin
text of Albertano even where there is no corresponding passage in the Tale
of Melibeus. Thus, in E 1373, there is mention of _Mardochee_; but he is
not named in B 2291. However, the Latin text has: 'Simili modo et Hester
Iudaeos per suum bonum consilium simul cum _Mardochaeo_, in regno Assueri
regis, sublimauit'; cap. v. (ed. T. Sundby, p. 17). Again, the lines E
1375-6 do not appear after B 2298 (their proper place), but only occur in
the Latin text: 'Quartam uero rationem ad hoc inducit Seneca, commendans
super omnia benignas coniuges; ait enim: Sicut nihil est superius benigna
coniuge, ita nihil est crudelius infesta muliere'; (p. 18).

Dr. Köppel has further pointed out, in the same article, that Chaucer has
also introduced into this Tale some quotations from another work by
Albertano, entitled Liber de amore et dilectione Dei; for examples, see the
Notes. Moreover, this Tale also exhibits quotations from Boethius, as, e.g.
in E 2021-2, for which see Boethius, bk. iii. pr. 2. 55; and, in one
passage, E 1582, we find a reminiscence both of Boethius, bk. v. met. 4. 8,
and of Troilus, i. 365. But, beyond all this, there is the somewhat
extraordinary reference to the Wife of Bath's Prologue in E 1685, where we
are told that she had already discussed the question of marriage 'in litel
space.' This shews at once, past all doubt, that the Marchantes Tale was
not only written later than Melibeus, Boethius, and Troilus; but even later
than the highly mature performance written in the Wife's name, as the
result of her wide experience.

The Tale practically consists of three parts. The first part (E 1245-1688)
is a discourse upon marriage, somewhat in the style of the Wife of Bath's
Prologue, but treating it from a more favourable point of view, with the
addition of some hints from Albertano of Brescia. The second part describes
the wedding of January and May, and the love-languor of Damian (E
1689-2056). The third part describes how January became blind, and the
means whereby he was restored to sight (E 2057-2418). The last part has
several analogues, and is, in fact, founded on a story once widely current.
For a full account of this story, see Originals and Analogues, Chaucer
Society, pp. 177 and 341. Chaucer probably took the outline of his story
from some French or Latin source. Tyrwhitt says:--'The scene of the
Marchantes Tale is laid in Italy, but none of the names, except Damian and
Justin, seem to be Italian, but rather made at pleasure; so that I doubt
whether the story be really of Italian growth. The adventure of _the
Pear-tree_ I find in a small collection of Latin fables, written by one
Adolphus, in elegiac verses of his fashion, in the year 1315. The same
story is inserted among the Fables of Alphonse, printed by Caxton in
English, with those of Æsop, Avian, and Pogge, without date; but I do not
find it in the original Latin of Alphonsus (MS. Bibl. Reg. 10 B xii), or in
any of the French translations of his work that I have examined.'

Five 'Pear-tree' stories are printed in the Originals and Analogues. The
first is the fable of Adolphus, above mentioned. It is the first fable in
Adolphi Fabulae, printed in Polycarpi Leyseri Historia Poetarum et Poematum
Medii Ævi: Halae Magdelburgiae, 1721, p. 2008. It consists of thirty-six
elegiac lines, and tells how a blind man's wife ascended a pear-tree in
which her lover was hidden; whereupon the blind man's sight was suddenly
restored, and she explains that the cure was due to her contrivance.
Another very similar story occurs in an Appendix to the Latin editions of
Æsop's Fables printed in the fifteenth century, and was reprinted by Wright
in his 'Latin Stories,' for the Percy Society, 1842, p. 78. This is the
same story, or nearly so, as the fable of Alphonsus which Tyrwhitt failed
to find, and is written in prose. The English version (as Tyrwhitt says)
was printed by Caxton in 1483, in The Book of the subtyl hystoryes and
Fables of Esope[141], at leaf 132. The title runs, 'The xii fable is of a
blynd man and of hys wyf.'

A third Latin 'Pear-tree' story occurs in the Comoedia Lydiae, by Matthieu
de Vendôme, and was printed from a MS. at Vienna, in Anecdota Poetica, &c.:
Poésies Inédites du moyen áge; par Edélestand du Méril; 1854, p. 370. This
is in seventy-two elegiac lines, and gives names to the personages
mentioned. The husband and wife are Duke Decius and Lydia; her lover is
Pyrrhus, and her maid is Lusca. Hence it is evidently the source of the
similar story in Boccaccio's Decamerone, Day 7, Nov. 9, in which the
husband and wife are Nicostratus and Lydia, and the lover is Pyrrhus, as
before. In this third version of the story the husband is not blind, but
the pear-tree is supposed to be enchanted, and to cause false illusions to
appear.

In the same Originals and Analogues, at p. 343, Mr. Clouston has collected
several Asiatic stories of a similar character, including one in the
Bahár-i Dánush, or Spring of Knowledge; a Turkish Version in the romance of
The Forty Vazírs, about an enchanted tree which is supposed to cause
illusions; and an Arabian Version found in the Breslau printed text of the
Arabian Nights, ed. Habicht and Fleischer, and printed in English in Tales
from the Arabic, by John Payne (London, printed for the Villon Society,
1884), vol. i. p. 270. Of a similar type is the story of The Officious
Father-in-Law, occurring in the Persian Sindibád Náma (second tale of the
Fifth Vazír), in the Túti Náma (eighth night, story of the Fifth Vazír),
and in the Sanskrit Suka Saptati (fifteenth night). A similar story to that
in the Bahár-i Dánush is current in Ceylon; and a translation of it is
given in the Orientalist, vol. ii. (1885), p. 148, reprinted by Mr.
Clouston. Other examples are added, which, however, bear but a remote
resemblance to the Tale in Chaucer.

I may add that I find a French variant of the story in the Poésies de Marie
de France, ed. Roquefort, Paris, 1820; 2 vols. It is the fortieth Fable in
that work, and is headed, 'Dou vileins qui vit un autre Hom od sa femme.'
But this version omits the husband's blindness and the pear-tree, and
merely says that a thing is not necessarily true because you _see_ it. In
conclusion, Mr. Clouston says:--'The model of both Boccaccio's and
Chaucer's tales seems to have been the version found in the Comoedia
Lydiae, or one similar to it. The story may perhaps exist in some of the
great medieval monkish collections of sermons, or of _exempla_ designed for
the use of preachers, such as the Sermones of Jacques de Vitry; the Liber
de Donis of Étienne de Bourbon; the Promptuarium Exemplorum of John Herolt;
the Summa Praedicantium of John Bromyard. In the absence of any Eastern
version representing the cuckolded husband as being blind and having his
sight miraculously restored to discover himself dishonoured, we must
conclude that this form of the story is of European invention. It is
needless to add that Chaucer's tale of January and May is incomparably the
best-told of all the versions, whether Asiatic or European.'

One peculiarity of this Tale requires further notice, viz. the mention of
Pluto. As to this, Tyrwhitt well remarks--'The machinery of the Faeries,
which Chaucer has used so happily, was probably added by himself; and
indeed I cannot help thinking, that his _Pluto_ and _Proserpina_ were the
true progenitors of _Oberon_ and _Titania_.... In the rest of his Faery
system, Shakespeare seems to have followed the popular superstitions of his
own time.'


GROUP F.

§ 67. THE SQUIRE'S PROLOGUE. Ten Brink assumes that Groups E and F
constitute but _one_ Group; for which there is no certain evidence. Many
MSS., including Pt., make the Wife's Tale follow the Marchantes Tale; and
there is nothing in the text itself to shew that the Epilogue to the
Marchantes Tale is inseparably connected with the Squire's Prologue.
Nevertheless, many good MSS., including E., write that Epilogue and the
Squire's Prologue _continuously_, and E. prefixes to the Epilogue a
rubric--'The Prologe of the Squieres Tale'; see vol. iv. p. 460, footnote.
The easiest way out of the difficulty is to adopt the arrangement in the
Six-text edition, which separates Group E from Group F as to the numbering
of the lines, but makes F follow E immediately.

The black-letter editions omit E 2419-2440 and F 1-8 altogether; so that
Tyrwhitt was the first to print these lines. He says: 'The Prologue to the
Squieres Tale [by which he means E 2419-40 and F 1-8] appears now for the
first time in print. Why it has been omitted by all former editors I cannot
guess, except, perhaps, because it did not suit with the place which, for
reasons best known to themselves, they were determined to assign to the
Squieres Tale, that is, after the Man of Lawes and before the
Marchantes[142]. I have chosen rather to follow the MSS. of the best
authority in placing the Squieres Tale after the Marchantes, and in
connecting them together by this Prologue, agreeably, as I am persuaded, to
Chaucer's intention. The lines which have been usually printed by way of
Prologue to the Squieres Tale, as I believe them to have been really
composed by Chaucer, though not intended for the Squieres Prologue, I have
prefixed to the Shipmannes Tale, for reasons which I shall give when I come
to speak of that Tale[143].'

In F 1, MSS. Hn. and Pt., and others, substitute _Sire Frankeleyn_ for
_Squyer_. This is obviously wrong, because it increases the number of
syllables in the line from ten syllables to twelve, and the number of
accents from five to six. Cf. § 69.

§ 68. THE SQUIERES TALE. As to this Tale, Tyrwhitt remarks: 'I have never
been able to discover the probable original of this Tale, and yet I should
be very hardly brought to believe that the whole, or even any considerable
part of it, was of Chaucer's invention.'

The general tone of it points to an Eastern, and especially to an Arabian
origin. In this connection, it is worth remarking that there is at least
one other case in which Chaucer is conected with an Arabian writer. I have
shewn, in the Introduction to the Treatise on the Astrolabe, that a large
part of it is immediately derived from a Latin version of a treatise
written by Messahala, an Arabian astronomer, by religion a Jew, who
flourished towards the end of the eighth century. So also in the case of
The Squieres Tale, we may suspect that it was through some Latin medium
that Chaucer made acquaintance with Arabian fiction. But I am fortunate in
having found a more direct clue to some part, at least, of the poem. I
shall shew presently that one of his sources was the Travels of Marco
Polo[144].

Warton, in his History of English Poetry, took much pains to gather
together some information on the subject, and his remarks are therefore
quoted here, nearly at length, for the reader's convenience. I omit most of
his references.

'The Canterbury Tales,' says Warton, 'are unequal, and of various merit.
Few perhaps, if any, of the stories are the invention of Chaucer. I have
already spoken at large of the Knight's Tale, one of our author's noblest
compositions. That of the Canterbury Tales which deserves the next place,
as written in the higher strain of poetry, and the poem by which Milton
describes and characterises Chaucer, is the Squire's Tale. The imagination
of this story consists in Arabian fiction engrafted on Gothic chivalry. Nor
is this Arabian fiction purely the sport of arbitrary fancy: it is in great
measure founded on Arabian learning. Cambuscan, a King of Tartary,
celebrates his birthday festival in the hall of his palace at Sarra with
the most royal magnificence. In the midst of the solemnity, the guests are
alarmed by a miraculous and unexpected spectacle: the minstrels cease on a
sudden, and all the assembly is hushed in silence, surprise, and suspense;
see ll. 77-88.

'These presents were sent by the King of Arabia and India to Cambuscan, in
honour of his feast. The Horse of Brass, on the skilful movement and
management of certain secret springs, transported his rider into the most
distant region of the world in the space of twenty-four hours; for, as the
rider chose, he could fly in the air with the swiftness of an eagle: and
again, as occasion required, he could stand motionless in opposition to the
strongest force, vanish on a sudden at command, and return at his master's
call. The Mirror of Glass was endued with the power of shewing any future
disasters which might happen to Cambuscan's kingdom, and discovered the
most hidden machinations of treason. The Naked Sword could pierce armour
deemed impenetrable, "were it as thikke as is a branched ook" (l. 159); and
he who was wounded with it could never be healed, unless its possessor
could be entreated to stroke the wound with its edge. The Ring was intended
for Canace, Cambuscan's daughter, and while she bore it in her purse, or
wore it on her thumb, enabled her to understand the language of every
species of birds, and the virtues of every plant.

'I have mentioned, in another place, the favourite philosophical studies of
the Arabians. In this poem the nature of those studies is displayed, and
their operations exemplified: and this consideration, added to the
circumstances of Tartary being the scene of action, and Arabia the country
from which these extraordinary presents are brought, induces me to believe
this story to be identical with one which was current at a very ancient
date among the Arabians[145]. At least it is formed on their principles.
Their sciences were tinctured with the warmth of their imaginations, and
consisted in wonderful discoveries and mysterious inventions.

'This idea of a Horse of Brass took its rise from their chemical knowledge
and experiments in metals. The treatise of Jeber, a famous Arab chemist of
the middle ages, called Lapis Philosophorum, contains many curious and
useful processes concerning the nature of metals, their fusion,
purification, and malleability, which still maintain a place in modern
systems of that science. The poets of romance, who deal in Arabian ideas,
describe the Trojan horse as made of brass. These sages pretended the power
of giving life or speech to some of their compositions in metal. Bishop
Grosseteste's speaking brazen head, sometimes attributed to Roger Bacon,
has its foundation in Arabian philosophy. In the romance of Valentine and
Orson, a brazen head fabricated by a necromancer in a magnificent chamber
of the castle of Clerimond, declares to those two princes their royal
parentage. We are told by William of Malmesbury that Pope Sylvester II, a
profound mathematician who lived in the eleventh century, made a brazen
head, which would speak when spoken to, and oracularly resolved many
difficult questions. Albertus Magnus, who was also a profound adept in
those sciences which were taught by the Arabian schools, is said to have
framed a man of brass, which not only answered questions readily and truly,
but was so loquacious, that Thomas Aquinas, while a pupil of Albertus
Magnus, and afterwards an Angelic doctor, knocked it in pieces as the
disturber of his abstruse speculations. This was about the year 1240. Much
in the same manner, the notion of our knight's horse being moved by means
of a concealed engine corresponds with their pretences of producing
preternatural effects, and their love of surprising by geometrical powers.
Exactly in this notion, Rocail, a giant in some of the Arabian romances, is
said to have built a palace, together with his own sepulchre, of most
magnificent architecture and with singular artifice: in both of these he
placed a great number of gigantic statues or images, figured of different
metals by talismanic skill, which in consequence of some occult machinery,
performed actions of real life, and looked like living men. We must add
that astronomy, which the Arabian philosophers studied with a singular
enthusiasm, had no small share in the composition of this miraculous steed.
For, says the poet,

 "He that it wroughte coude ful many a gin;
  He wayted many a constellacioun,
  Er he had doon this operacioun." (ll. 128-130.)

'Thus the buckler of the Arabian giant Ben Gian, as famous among the
Orientals as that of Achilles among the Greeks, was fabricated by the
powers of astronomy; and Pope Sylvester's brazen head, just mentioned, was
prepared under the influence of certain constellations.

'Natural magic, improperly so called, was likewise a favourite pursuit of
the Arabians, by which they imposed false appearances on the spectator....
Chaucer, in the fiction before us, supposes that some of the guests in
Cambuscan's hall believed the Trojan horse to be a temporary illusion,
effected by the power of magic (l. 218)....

'Optics were likewise a branch of study which suited the natural genius of
the Arabian philosophers, and which they pursued with incredible delight.
This science was a part of the Aristotelic philosophy which, as I have
before observed, they refined and filled with a thousand extravagances.
Hence our strange knight's Mirror of Glass, prepared on the most profound
principles of art, and endued with preternatural qualities (ll. 225-234,
132-141).

'Alcen, or Alhazen, mentioned in l. 232, an Arabic philosopher, wrote seven
books of perspective, and flourished about the eleventh century. Vitellio,
formed on the same school, was likewise an eminent mathematician of the
middle ages, and wrote ten books on Perspective. The Roman Mirror here
mentioned by Chaucer, as similar to this of the strange knight, is thus
described by Gower:--

 "Whan Rome stood in noble plite,
  Virgile, which was tho parfite,
  A mirrour made of his clergye [_by his skill_],
  And sette it in the townes ye [_eye_, _sight_]
  Of marbre on a piller withoute,
  That they, by thritty mile aboute,
  By day and eek also by nighte
  In that mirrour beholde mighte
  Her ennemies, if any were";
           Conf. Amant. bk. v. (ii. 195).

'The Oriental writers relate that Giamschid, one of their kings, the
Solomon of the Persians and their Alexander the Great, possessed among his
inestimable treasures cups, globes, and mirrors, of metal, glass, and
crystal, by means of which he and his people knew all natural as well as
supernatural things. The title of an Arabian book translated from the
Persian is--The Mirror which reflects the World. There is this passage in
an ancient Turkish poet: "When I am purified by the light of heaven, my
soul will become the mirror of the world, in which I shall discern all
abstruse secrets." Monsieur Herbelot is of opinion that the Orientals took
these notions from the patriarch Joseph's cup of divination and Nestor's
cup in Homer, on which all nature was symbolically represented. Our great
countryman Roger Bacon, in his Opus Majus, a work entirely formed on the
Aristotelic and Arabian philosophy, describes a variety of _Specula_, and
explains their construction and uses. This is the most curious and
extraordinary part of Bacon's book, which was written about the year 1270.
Bacon's optic tube, with which he pretended to see future events, was
famous in his age, and long afterwards, and chiefly contributed to give him
the name of a magician. This art, with others of the experimental kind, the
philosophers of those times were fond of adapting to the purposes of
thaumaturgy; and there is much occult and chimerical speculation in the
discoveries which Bacon affects to have made from optical experiments. He
asserts (and I am obliged to cite the passage in his own mysterious
expressions) "omnia sciri per Perspectivam, quoniam omnes actiones rerum
fiunt secundum specierum et virtutum multiplicationem ab agentibus hujus
mundi in materias patientes," &c.[146] Spenser feigns that the magician
Merlin made a glassy globe, and presented it to King Ryence, which showed
the approach of enemies, and discovered treasons (F. Q. iii. 2. 21). This
fiction, which exactly corresponds with Chaucer's Mirror, Spenser borrowed
from some romance, perhaps of King Arthur, fraught with Oriental fancy.
From the same sources came a like fiction of Camoens in the Lusiad (canto
x), where a globe is shown to Vasco de Gama, representing the universal
fabric or system of the world, in which he sees future kingdoms and future
events. The Spanish historians report an American tradition, but more
probably invented by themselves, and built on the Saracen fables in which
they were so conversant. They pretended that some years before the
Spaniards entered Mexico, the inhabitants caught a monstrous fowl, of
unusual magnitude and shape, on the lake of Mexico. In the crown of the
head of this wonderful bird there was a mirror or plate of glass, in which
the Mexicans saw their future invaders the Spaniards, and all the disasters
which afterwards happened to their kingdom. These superstitions remained,
even in the doctrines of philosophers, long after the darker ages.
Cornelius Agrippa, a learned physician of Cologne about the year 1520, and
author of a famous book on the Vanity of the Sciences, mentions a species
of mirror which exhibited the form of persons absent, at command. In one of
these he is said to have shown to the poetical Earl of Surrey the image of
his mistress, the beautiful Geraldine, sick and reposing on a couch. Nearly
allied to this was the infatuation of seeing things in a beryl, which was
very popular in the reign of James I, and is alluded to by Shakespeare....

'The Naked Sword, another of the gifts presented by the strange knight to
Cambuscan, endued with medical virtues, and so hard as to pierce the most
solid armour, is likewise an Arabian idea. It was suggested by their skill
in medicine, by which they affected to communicate healing qualities to
various substances, and by their knowledge of tempering iron and hardening
all kinds of metal. It is the classical spear of Peleus, perhaps originally
fabricated in the same regions of fancy; see ll. 236-246.

'The sword which Berni, in the Orlando Innamorato, gives to the hero
Ruggiero, is tempered by much the same sort of magic:--

 "Il brando con tal arte fabbricato,
  Che taglia incanto, ed ogni fatagione[147]";
                              Orl. Innamor. ii. 17, st. 5.

So also his continuator Ariosto:--

 "Non vale incanto, ov'ella mette il taglio[148]";
                              Orl. Fur. xli. 83.

And the notion that this weapon could resist all incantations is like the
fiction above mentioned of the buckler of the Arabian giant Ben Gian, which
baffled the force of charms and enchantments made by giants or demons.
Spenser has a sword endued with the same efficacy, the metal of which the
magician Merlin mixed with the juice of meadow-wort, that it might be proof
against enchantment; and afterwards, having forged the blade in the flames
of Etna, he gave it hidden virtue by dipping it seven times in the bitter
waters of Styx; F. Q. ii. 8. 20. From the same origin is also the golden
lance of Berni, which Galafron, King of Cathaia, father of the beautiful
Angelica and the invincible champion Argalia, procured for his son by the
help of a magician. This lance was of such irresistible power, that it
unhorsed a knight the instant he was touched with its point; Orl. Innamor.
i. 1. 43. Britomart in Spenser is armed with the same enchanted spear,
which was made by Bladud, an ancient British king skilled in magic; F. Q.
iii. 3. 60; iv. 6. 6; iii. 1. 10.

'The Ring, a gift to the king's daughter Canace, which taught the language
of birds, is also quite in the style of some others of the occult sciences
of these inventive philosophers; and it is the fashion of the Oriental
fabulists to give language to brutes in general. But to understand the
language of birds was peculiarly one of the boasted sciences of the
Arabians, who pretend that many of their countrymen have been skilled in
the knowledge of the language of birds ever since the time of King Solomon.
Their writers relate that Balkis, the Queen of Sheba or Saba, had a bird
called _Hudhud_, that is, a lapwing, which she dispatched to King Solomon
on various occasions, and that this trusty bird was the messenger of their
amours. We are told that Solomon having been secretly informed by this
winged confidant that Balkis intended to honour him with a grand embassy,
enclosed a spacious square with a wall of gold and silver bricks, in which
he ranged his numerous troops and attendants in order to receive the
ambassadors, who were astonished at the suddenness of these splendid and
unexpected preparations. Herbelot tells a curious story of an Arab feeding
his camels in a solitary wilderness, who was accosted for a draught of
water by Alhejaj, a famous Arabian commander, who had been separated from
his retinue in hunting. While they were talking together, a bird flew over
their heads, making at the same time an unusual sort of noise, which the
camel-feeder hearing, looked steadfastly on Alhejaj, and demanded who he
was. Alhejaj, not choosing to return him a direct answer, desired to know
the meaning of that question. "Because," replied the camel-feeder, "this
bird assures me that a company of people is coming this way, and that you
are the chief of them." While he was speaking, Alhejaj's attendants
arrived.

'This wonderful Ring also imparted to the wearer a knowledge of the
qualities of plants, which formed an important part of the Arabian
philosophy; see ll. 146-155.

'Every reader of taste and imagination must regret that, instead of our
author's tedious detail of the quaint effects of Canace's ring, in which a
falcon relates her amours, and talks familiarly of Troilus, Paris, and
Jason, the notable achievements we may suppose to have been performed by
the assistance of the horse of brass are either lost, or that this part of
the story, by far the most interesting, was never written. After the
strange knight has explained to Cambuscan the management of this magical
courser, he vanishes on a sudden, and we hear no more of him; ll. 302-343.

'By such inventions we are willing to be deceived. These are triumphs of
deception over truth:--

 "Magnanima mensogna, hor quando è il vero
  Si bello, che si possa à te preporre?[149]"'

This learned and curious discourse is well worth perusal; but the reader
will probably be led to remark, that Warton does not after all tell us
whence Chaucer drew his materials, but only proves that he drew them from
some Arabian source. That source may be indicated a little more distinctly;
for, as will be shewn more fully below, nearly all the magical particulars
are to be found in the collection now known as the Arabian Nights'
Entertainments. For the rest, we may trace most of the descriptions to the
travels of Marco Polo, with which Chaucer must have been acquainted to some
extent, either immediately or through some channel not easily now pointed
out. This suggestion occurred to me on reading a note by Colonel Yule on
the name of Cambuscan; but in this I have been long anticipated by Mr.
Keightley, as noted above (p. 463, note 2). The passage in Colonel Yule's
edition of Marco Polo to which I refer, is as follows:--

'Before parting with Chingis [or Gengis Khan] let me point out what has not
to my knowledge been suggested before, that the name of "_Cambuscan_ bold"
in Chaucer's tale is only a corruption of the name of Chinghiz. The name of
the conqueror appears in Friar Ricold as _Camiuscan_, from which the
transition to Cambuscan presents no difficulty[150]. _Camius_ was, I
suppose, a clerical corruption out of _Canjus_ or _Cianjus_.'--Marco Polo,
ed. Yule, i. 218.

On applying to Professor Palmer for information as to the _meaning_ of the
name, he kindly pointed out to me that, in the Dictionnaire Turk-Oriental
by M. Pavet de Courteille (Paris, 1870), p. 289, the word _djenguiz_ (as M.
de Courteille spells it) is explained to mean simply _great_. Thus Chinghiz
Khan is no more than _Great Khan_; and Cambinskan merely represents the
same title of Great Khan, which appears so repeatedly in Marco Polo's
travels. The succession of supreme or Great Khans was as follows:--(1)
Chinghiz; (2) Okkadai; (3) Kuyuk; (4) Mangku; (5) Kublai, &c. The first of
these is always known by the simple _title_, though his real name was
Temugin; the second was his son; and the third, fourth, and fifth were all
his grandsons. The descriptions in Marco Polo refer to Kublai Khan, who
died in 1294. Marco describes his person with some minuteness:--

'The personal appearance of the Great Kaan, Lord of Lords, whose name is
Cublay, is such as I shall now tell you. He is of a good stature, neither
tall nor short, but of a middle height. He has a becoming amount of flesh,
and is very shapely in all his limbs. His complexion is white and red, the
eyes black and fine, the nose well formed and well set on': ed. Yule, i.
318. A portrait of him, from a Chinese engraving, is given by Colonel Yule
on the next page. Kublai was succeeded by his grandson Teimur, to the
exclusion of his elder brothers _Kambala_ (who squinted) and Tarmah (who
was of a weak constitution). Here we might perhaps think to see the
original of Chaucer's _Camballo_, but I suspect the real interpretation to
be very different. It is far more probable that the name _Camballo_ was
caught, not from this obscure Kambala, but from the famous word _Cambaluc_,
really the name (not of a person, but) of the celebrated capital which
Kublai built and where he resided; so that the name may easily have
suggested itself from this connexion[151]. For example, in the splendid
Bodleian MS. No. 264, generally known as the 'Alexander MS.,' there is a
copy of Marco Polo's Travels, with the colophon--_Explicit le Livre nommé
du Grant Caan de la Graunt Cité de Cambaluc; Dieux ayde; Amen._ In fact,
Cambaluc is but the old name of the city which is still the capital of
China, but better known as _Pekin_; the etymology of the word being merely
_Kaan-baligh_, i.e. the city of the Khan. All this may seem a little
uncertain at first sight; but if the reader can turn to the second book of
Marco Polo, he will soon see clearly enough that Chaucer's Cambinskan
(though the name itself is formed from Chinghiz Khan) is practically
identical with Marco's Kublai Khan, and that it is to Marco's description
of him and his court that Chaucer is ultimately indebted for some of his
details. This will be best illustrated by examples of correspondences.

'Of a surety he [Kublai Khan] hath good right to such a title [that of
_Kaan_ or Emperor], for all men know for a certain truth that he is the
most potent man, as regards forces and lands and treasure, that existeth in
the world, or ever hath existed from the time of our first father Adam
until this day'; Marco Polo, ed. Yule, i. 295. Cf. Sq. Ta. 14.

'The empire fell to him because of his ability and valour and great worth,
as was right and reason'; id. i. 296. Cf. Sq. Ta. 16.

'He had often been to the wars, and had shown himself a gallant soldier and
an excellent captain'; id. i. 296. Cf. Sq. Ta. 23.

In Book ii. ch. 4, is an account of his taking the field in person, and
acting with astonishing vigour and rapidity, even at the age of
seventy-three.

In Book ii. ch. 5, it is related that the enemy whom he then subdued had
Christians in his army, some of whom bore standards on which the Cross was
displayed. After the battle, the Christians were bitterly taunted with
this, and were told that their Cross had not helped them. But Kublai
reproved the scoffers, saying that the Cross had done its part well in not
assisting the rebels. 'The Cross of your God did well in that it gave him
[the rebel chief] no help against the right.' Cf. Sq. Ta. 16-21.

His rewards to his captains are described fully in chap. 7. He gave them
silver plate, ornaments, 'fine jewels of gold and silver, and pearls and
precious stones; insomuch that the amount that fell to each of them was
something astonishing.' Cf. Sq. Ta. 26.

His palace, 'the greatest palace that ever was,' is described in chap. 10.
It was situate 'in the capital city of Cathay, which is called _Cambaluc_.'
The _hall_ of the palace 'could easily dine 6000 people.' The _parks_
within its enclosure were full of fine trees and 'beasts of sundry kinds,
such as white stags and fallow deer, gazelles and roebucks,' &c. Cf. Sq.
Ta. 60-62, 392.

'And when the great Kaan sits at table on any great court occasion, it is
in this fashion. His table is elevated a good deal above the others, and he
sits at the north end of the hall, looking towards the south, with his
chief wife beside him on the left,' &c.; i. 338. Near the table is a golden
butt, at each corner of which is one of smaller size holding a firkin, 'and
from the former the wine or beverage flavoured with fine and costly spices
is drawn off into the latter'; i. 339. 'And when the Emperor is going to
drink, all the musical instruments, of which he has vast store of every
kind, begin to play'; i. 340. 'I will say nought about the dishes, as you
may easily conceive that there is a great plenty of every possible kind.
And when all have dined and the tables have been removed, then come in a
great number of players and jugglers, adepts at all sorts of wonderful
feats,' &c.; i. 340. Cf. Sq. Ta. 59-68, 77-79, 266-271, 218, 219.

'You must know that the Tartars keep high festival yearly on their
birthdays.... Now on his birthday, the Great Kaan dresses in the best of
his robes, all wrought with beaten gold'; i. 343. 'On his birthday also,
all the Tartars in the world, and all the countries and governments that
owe allegiance to the Kaan, offer him great presents according to their
several ability, and according as prescription or orders have fixed the
amount'; i. 344. Cf. Sq. Ta. 44-47, 110-114.

The Kaan also holds a feast called the 'White Feast' on New-year's day,
i.e. at the vernal equinox. 'On that day, I can assure you, among the
customary presents there shall be offered to the Kaan from various quarters
more than 100,000 white horses, beautiful animals and richly caparisoned';
i. 346.

When he goes on a hunting expedition, 'he takes with him fully 10,000
falconers, and some 500 gerfalcons besides _peregrines_, sakers, and other
hawks in great number'; i. 358. He also has another 'grand park' at
Chandu[152], 'where he keeps his gerfalcons in mew'; i. 365. At p. 260 he
is described again as 'very fond of hawking.' At p. 237 the peregrine
falcons are described particularly. At p. 220 we are told that the Tartars
'eat all kinds of flesh, including that of horses and dogs, and Pharaoh's
rats.' Cf. Sq. Ta. 424-429, 69-71.

In the great city of Kinsay 'there is an eminence on which stands a tower.'
This was used as an alarm-tower in case of fire; see vol. ii. p. 148. This
may serve to illustrate Chaucer's 'maister tour.' Still more curious is the
account of the city of Mien, with its two towers covered with plates of
gold and silver, which 'form one of the finest sights in the world'; ii.
73. These towers were, however, part of a mausoleum. Cf. Sq. Ta. 176, 226.

The following note about the Tartar invasion of Russia is also worthy of
attention:--

'Rosia [_Russia_] is a very great province, lying towards the north....
There are many strong defiles and passes in the country; and they pay
tribute to nobody except to a certain Tartar king of the Ponent [i.e.
_West_], whose name is Toctai; to him indeed they pay tribute, but only a
trifle.'--Marco Polo, ed. Yule, ii. 417. On this passage Col. Yule has the
note: 'Russia was overrun with fire and sword as far as Tver and Torshok by
Batu Khan (123-38), some years before his invasion of Poland and Silesia.
Tartar tax-gatherers were established in the Russian cities as far as
Rostov and Jaroslawl, and for many years Russian princes as far as Novgorod
paid homage to the Mongol Khans in their court at _Sarai_[153]. Their
subjection to the Khans was not such a trifle as Polo seems to imply; and
at least a dozen princes met their death at the hands of the Mongol
executioner.'

Some of the Mongolian Tartars, known as the 'Golden Horde,' conquered a
part of S. E. Russia in 1223; in 1242 they established the Empire of the
Khan of Kaptschak (S. E. Russia), and exercised great influence there. In
1380 was another Tartar war; and in 1383 Moscow was burnt. The Tartar power
in Russia was crushed by the general of Ivan III in 1481. See Haydn's
Dictionary of Dates, under _Golden Horde_ and _Russia_.

The whole subject of magic is so vast that it is not easy to deal with it
within a reasonable space. I must therefore content myself with pointing
out a few references, &c., that seem most worthy of being here noted.

_The Magic Horse_ appears in the tale of Cleomades and Claremond; see
Keightley's Tales and Popular Fictions. Cervantes has put him to memorable
use in his Don Quixote, where he describes him as 'aquel mismo caballo de
madera sobre quien llevo el valeroso Pierres robada á la linda
Magalona'--'that very wooden horse upon which the valiant Peter of Provence
carried off the fair Magalona[154]. This horse is governed by a pin he has
in his forehead, which serves for a bridle,' &c.; see Jarvis's translation,
vol. ii. chap, xl., ed. 1809. But the best story of the Enchanted Horse is
in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, where he is said to have been
presented by an Indian to the king of Persia on the New Day, i.e. on the
first day of the solar year, at the vernal equinox. This horse is governed
by a peg in his neck, which was turned round when it was necessary for him
to fly: see the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, published by Nimmo, 1865,
p. 483; or the excellent edition by Lane, vol. ii. p. 463, which varies
considerably from the more popular editions.

The tale of Cleomades is alluded to, says Mr. Keightley, in Caxton's
edition of Reynard the Foxe, printed in 1481, in the 32nd chapter[155]. He
also cites a note by Sir F. Madden that a copy of the poem of Cleomades was
purchased by Sir Thomas Phillipps at Mr. Lang's sale in 1828; that an
undated edition of the Histoire Plaisante et Récréative du noble et
excellent chevalier Clamades et de la belle Clermonde was printed at
Troyes; and that Les Aventures de Clamades et Clarmonde appeared in Paris
in 1733. Mr. Lane agrees with Mr. Keightley in considering the Tale of
Cleomades identical with that of the Enchanted Horse in the Arabian Nights'
Entertainments, and in supposing that it was originally a Persian story.
Mr. Lane thinks it is derived from the 'Hezár Afsaneh'; see his edition,
ii. 491.

It is not out of place to observe that the town of Seville is frequently
mentioned in Cleomades, and we have seen that Cervantes had heard of the
story. Perhaps, then, we may suppose that the story, originally Persian,
found its way into Arabic, and thence into Spain; it would then soon be
written down in Latin, and thence be translated into French, and become
generally known. This must have happened, too, at an early period; for the
French romance of Cleomades, extending to some 19,000 octosyllabic lines,
was written by a poet named Adenet surnamed le Roi, a native of Brabant,
between the years 1275 and 1283; see Keightley's Tales, p. 40.

_The Magic Mirror_ is a common fiction, and we may connect it with the
magic ivory tube, furnished with glass, which enabled the user of it to see
whatever object he might wish to behold. This fancy occurs in the tale of
the Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Pari Banou, as told in the Arabian Nights'
Entertainments (Nimmo, 1865), p. 501. It is hardly worth while to pursue
the subject further, as Warton's comments have already been cited, and Mr.
Clouston's essay (mentioned below) can be consulted.

_The Magic Ring_ is to be referred to the story of the seal-ring made
partly of brass and partly of iron, by which Solomon obtained power over
the evil Jinn; see Lane's Arabian Nights, i. 31[156]. The ineffable name of
Allah was engraved upon it, and gave it its virtue. The notion of its
conferring upon the wearer the power of understanding the language of birds
is connected with it, because this was one of the faculties which Solomon
possessed; for we read in the Koran, as translated by Sale, that 'Solomon
was David's heir; and he said, "O men, we have been taught the speech of
birds";' ch. xxvii. A clever Arabic epigram of the thirteenth century,
ascribing to King Solomon a knowledge of the language of birds and beasts,
is cited in Professor Palmer's History of the Jewish Nation, at p. 93. Even
Hudibras understood the language of birds; Hudib. pt. 1. c. 1. l. 547. See
further, as to this subject, in the remarks below, upon the Manciples Tale
(Group H); § 75.

With regard to _the Falcon_, Leigh Hunt has well observed, in his Essay on
Wit and Humour, that this bird is evidently 'a human being, in a temporary
state of metempsychosis, a circumstance very common in tales of the East.'
This is probably true, as otherwise the circumstances of the story become
poor and meaningless; it is something more than a mere fable like that of
the Cock and Fox. If the story had been completed, shewing how the Falcon
'gat her love again,' we should have seen how she was restored to her first
shape, by means, as Chaucer hints, of the magic ring. A talking bird
appears in the Story of the Sisters who envied their Younger Sister, the
last in some editions of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, but it is not
transformed. On the other hand, in the story of Beder, Prince of Persia, in
the same collection--which, by the way, mentions a magic ring--we find
Prince Beder transformed into a white bird, and recovering his shape on
being sprinkled with magic water; but he does not speak while so
metamorphosed. The story of a boy who understands the language of birds
occurs in the Seven Sages, ed. Wright, p. 106; and Mr. Wright shews, in his
Introduction, that such oriental tales are of great antiquity, and known in
Europe in the thirteenth century. He refers us to an Essai sur les Fables
Indiennes, et sur leur Introduction en Europe, by M. Deslongchamps,
published in 1838. Cf. Weber, Met. Rom. iii. 137.

The reader should not forget the hint in the Notes to the Minor Poems (vol.
i. p. 534), that some expressions in the Squieres Tale are taken from the
poem of Queen Anelida.

With respect to the ending of the Squieres Tale, two attempts at least have
been made to complete it. Spenser, in his Faerie Queene (bk. iv. c. 2.
30-3. 52), accounts for the fighting for Canacee, but he omits all about
Cambinskan and the Falcon. Another ending was written by John Lane[157] in
1630, and is contained in MSS. Douce 170 and Ashmole 53, in the Bodleian
Library. Warton (Observations on the Fairy Queen, p. 214) justly calls it a
weak performance.

Dr. Furnivall has printed the whole of this poem, in twelve tedious parts,
for the Chaucer Society; and the result shews that Lane's work is bad
almost beyond belief. It is the duty of every man who values his time to
decline to read 237 pages of such stuff as this:--

  Algarsif at his broother shooke his pike:
  Camballo stowtlie did att him the like;
  naie, quicklie, with a shock of pikes, chargd home,
  theare right to make his rendeuous first known:
  gainst whome Algarsif rann from thambuscado,
  to prove his ernest provd no French bravado.'

Since I wrote the preceding remarks, which were formerly printed in my
edition of The Prioresses Tale, &c., for the Clarendon Press, Mr. Clouston
has taken up the subject in a very exhaustive manner. I must therefore
refer the reader to his essay 'On the Magical Elements in Chaucer's
Squire's Tale, with Analogues,' printed for the Chaucer Society in 1889. He
there deals fully with the subjects of Magic Horses, Chariots, &c., Magic
Mirrors and Images, Magic Rings and Gems, the Language of Animals, and
Magic Swords and Spears. He lays particular stress upon the Romance of
Cléomadès and Claremonde above mentioned, to which Keightley had already
drawn attention. 'The French prose version, called L'Histoire et Chronique
du vaillant Chevallier Cléomadès et la belle Claremonde, appeared about the
year 1480[158]; and of this work Count Tressan published an _extrait_ in
the Bibliothèque des romans, April 1777, t. i. 169 ff.; see also Oeuvres du
Conte de Tressan, Paris, 1822, t. iii. pp. 255-298. Of this abstract
Keightley gives an English translation in his Tales and Popular Fictions,
pp. 43-69.

'Keightley has remarked that the name of Claremonde occurs in the romance
of Valentine and Orson, it being that of the lady beloved by the valiant
hero, and also that a magic horse figures in the same work; but he has
strangely overlooked a number of incidents which have evidently been
adopted from the story of Cléomadès and Claremonde. The magic horse is
described in the 21st chapter of a chap-book version of The Renown'd
History of Valentine and Orson, the two Sons of the Emperor of Greece.

'I quite agree with M. Paris in considering that the origin of the French
metrical romance was Morisco-Spanish, whether Adenès derived his materials
from Blanche of Castile, or otherwise.'

With respect to the story of the Falcon, Mr. Clouston observes: 'The scene
between Canacé and the Falcon is essentially Asiatic, and Warton's
complaint that the bird is represented as talking of Troilus, Paris, and
Jason, is utterly absurd. It is, in fact, an Indian fable, with a bird
talking out of the Grecian classics instead of out of the Vedas and the
Shastras. If the poet had any purpose in writing the story of the deserted
Falcon, it could only have been that of any Asiatic fabler, namely, to
convey certain moral lessons through the feigned speech of a bird. That
Chaucer had before him, or in his memory, a model for his story of the
Falcon is not only possible but highly probable. There exists a somewhat
analogous ancient Indian tale of two birds--a male parrot and a hen-maina,
a species of hill-starling--in which, however, it is the male bird who is
distressed at the female's treachery, and is about to cast himself into the
midst of a forest-fire, when he is rescued by a benevolent traveller, to
whom he relates the story of his woes. This tale forms the third of the
Twenty-five Tales of a Vampyre (Vetála panchavinsati), and may be found in
Tawney's translation of the Kathá Sarit Ságara, vol. ii. pp. 245-250.'

It is necessary to mention here that Prof. Brandl, of Göttingen, in
Englische Studien, xii. 161, actually propounded a theory that Cambinskan
was intended to represent Edward III., and that Canacee does not mean 'the
king's daughter,' as Chaucer (who might be supposed to know) expressly
says, but his daughter-in-law Constance, second wife of John of Gaunt; with
much more to the same effect, all purely gratuitous. Fortunately, his
theory was promptly shewn to be untenable by Prof. Kittredge, of Harvard
University, in a paper which also appeared in Englische Studien, xiii. 1;
and we may dismiss this dream as being wholly unfounded. The Tale was
written after Edward's death.

§ 69. WORDS OF THE FRANKELEYN. See F 673-708. In at least fifteen MSS. and
in the black-letter editions, the Squieres Tale is followed by the
Marchantes Tale. In order to suit this arrangement, the word _Frankeleyn_
in F 675 is altered to _Marchant_. So again, in ll. 696 and 699. In the
last case, the rime is affected; and, to bring this right, the words _the
frankeleyn_ are altered to _the marchant, certeyn_. Tyrwhitt well points
out two grave objections to this arrangement. The former is, that, in this
case, the Marchant is made (in F 682, 690) to say that he has a son who has
learnt to play at dice, and only a few lines further on (in E 1233-4) that
he has been married just two months, and _not more_! The latter is, that
the sentiments attributed to the speaker, who laments his son's
extravagance and praises 'gentillesse,' are suitable to the character of
the honest and hospitable Frankeleyn, but not to that of the Marchant, if
we may judge of his sentiments from the loose character of his Tale. In the
same editions and in most of the MSS., the Frankeleyns Tale follows the
Clerkes Tale, causing further trouble. The editions also transpose one of
the stanzas in Chaucer's Envoy to the Clerkes Tale, so as to make E
1195-1200 come at the end. They then insert the (genuine) stanza printed in
the footnote to vol. iv. p. 424, and afterwards pass on at once to F 709.
The same arrangement occurs in MS. Harl. 7333. Other MSS. insert (after the
Clerkes Tale) various scraps taken from E 2419-40, followed by lines
corresponding to F 1-8, at the same time changing _Squyer_ (in F 1) to
_Sire Frankeleyn_, which makes the line too long. Cf. § 67.

However, the best MSS., including E. and Dd., are here correct; and we have
only to follow their guidance. In these, the Words of the Frankeleyn (F
673-708) are immediately followed by the true Prologue to the Frankeleyns
Tale (F 709-728).

§ 70. THE FRANKLIN'S PROLOGUE. This Prologue is rightly placed before the
Tale even in the black-letter editions and in the MSS. which assign lines
673-708 to the Marchant. In the old editions, it follows the (once final)
stanza of the Clerkes Tale which is printed in the footnote to p. 424 (vol.
iv).

§ 71. THE FRANKELEYNS TALE. We cannot doubt that Chaucer adapted this Tale,
as he himself asserts, from a Breton lay; cf. note to F 709. Not only is
the scene laid in Brittany (F 729), but we find special mention of Penmark
(801) and of Kayrrud (808); see notes. The story itself turns upon the
magical removal of rocks on the Breton coast (993). This is particularly
worthy of notice, because (as will be seen below) Boccaccio altered this
circumstance in order to render the story more congruous to an Italian
location and scenery; a fact which shews at once that Chaucer did not adopt
the story from the Italian, as some have inconsiderately assumed. It must
be said once more, that Chaucer does not seem to have read the Decamerone.

The whole character of the story agrees well with that of the Breton lays
versified by Marie de France; indeed, it is almost a wonder that her
collection does not include the story now under consideration.

The ultimate source of the Tale is certainly Eastern, as shewn in Mr.
Clouston's essay on the story of 'The Damsel's Rash Promise,' printed in
Originals and Analogues (Chaucer Soc.), p. 291. I cannot do better than
transcribe his remarks:--

'The oldest known form of Chaucer's well-told Tale of the chaste Dorigen is
probably found in a group of Indian fictions entitled Vetála Panchavinsati,
"Twenty-five Tales of a Vetála," or Vampyre, which are incorporated with
the great Sanskrit collection, Kathá Sarit Ságara, "Ocean of the Rivers of
Story"; but they still exist as a separate and distinct work, though
considerably abridged, in most of the vernacular languages of India: in
Tamil, Vedála Kadai; in Hindí, Bytál Pachísí, &c.... This is the Vetála
story, from Prof. C. H. Tawney's translation of the Kathá Sarit Ságara,
published at Calcutta, vol. ii. p. 278[159].


'THE STORY OF MADANASENÁ.

'There was an excellent King of the name of Vírabáhu, who imposed his
orders on the heads of all kings. He had a splendid city named Anangapura,
and in it there lived a rich merchant, named Arthadatta; that
merchant-prince had for elder child a son called Dhanadatta, and his
younger child was a pearl of maidens, named Madanasená.

'One day, as she was playing with her companions in her own garden, a young
merchant, named Dharmadatta, a friend of her brother, saw her. When he saw
that maiden ..., he was at once robbed of his senses by the arrows of love,
that fell upon him in showers.... Then Madanasená entered her house, and
grief at no longer beholding her entered the breast of Dharmadatta....

'In the meanwhile Dharmadatta went home, and thinking upon that fair one,
he remained tossing to and fro upon his bed, smitten by the rays of the
moon.... And in the morning he woke up, and went and saw her once more in
that very garden, alone and in privacy. So he went up to her, longing to
embrace her, and falling at her feet, he tried to coax her with words
tender from affection. But she said to him with great earnestness: "I am a
maiden, betrothed to another ... for my father has bestowed me on the
merchant Samudradatta, and I am to be married in a few days."... But
Dharmadatta said to her: "Happen what may, I cannot live without you." When
the merchant's daughter heard this, she was afraid that he would use force
to her, so she said to him: "Let my marriage first be celebrated here; let
my father reap the long-desired fruit of bestowing a daughter in marriage;
then will I certainly visit you, for your love has gained my heart." When
he heard this, he said: "I love not a woman that has been embraced by
another man."... She replied: "Then I will visit you as soon as I am
married, and afterwards I will go to my husband." But though she made this
promise, he would not let her go without further assurance; so she
confirmed the truth of her promise with an oath. Then he let her go, and
she entered the house in low spirits.

'And when the lucky day had arrived, and the auspicious ceremony of
marriage had taken place, she went to her husband's house, and spent that
day in merriment, and then retired with him. But she repelled her husband's
caresses, and said slowly, with downcast face: "I love you more than my
life, but hear what I have to say. Rise up cheerfully, and promise me
immunity from punishment; take an oath to that effect, my husband, in order
that I may tell you." [She then repeats the story.]

'Samudradatta ... being bound by the necessity of keeping his word ... gave
her leave to go where she would; and she rose up, and left her husband's
house....

'A certain thief saw Madanasená, as she was going along alone at night, and
rushing upon her, seized her by the hem of her garment.... The helpless
merchant's daughter told him her story, and entreated him as follows:
"Excuse me for a moment that I may keep my word, and as soon as I have done
that, I will quickly return to you, if you remain here. Believe me, my good
man, I will never break this true promise of mine." When the thief heard
that, he let her go.... She, for her part, went to the merchant
Dharmadatta. And when he saw that she had come to that wood, he asked how
it happened; and then, though he had longed for her, he said to her, "I am
delighted at your faithfulness to your promise: What have I to do with you,
the wife of another? So go back, as you came, before any one sees you."...
[Then] she went to the thief, who was waiting for her in the road.... She
told him how the merchant let her go. Then the thief said: "Since this is
so, then I also will let you go, being pleased with your truthfulness:
return home with your ornaments."

'So he, too, let her go, and ... [she] went delighted to her husband, and
... she told him the whole story. And Samudradatta, perceiving that his
good wife had kept her word without losing her honour, ... welcomed her as
a pure-minded woman, who had not disgraced her family, and lived happily
with her ever afterwards.

'When the Vétála had told this story ... to king Trivikramasena, he went on
to say to him: "So tell me, King, which was the really generous man of
those three--the two merchants and the thief?"... The king said to him: "Of
those three the thief was the only really generous man.... For of course
her husband let her go ... how could a gentleman desire to keep a wife that
was attached to another? And the other resigned her because his passion was
dulled by time, and he was afraid that her husband, knowing the facts,
would tell the king the next day. But the thief, a reckless evil-doer,
working in the dark, was really generous to let go a lovely woman,
ornaments and all."'

The resemblance of this to Chaucer's story is certainly striking. The chief
variation is in changing the thief into a magician who performs wonders for
a large sum of money.

Mr. Clouston subjoins many variants of the story. One, originally in
Burmese, is from Captain Sparks' translation of the Decisions of Princess
Thoodhamma Tsari. A Persian analogue is given from Sir John Malcolm's
Sketches of Persia, chap. xx.; and another from the celebrated Persian
collection, entitled Tútí Náma, or Parrot-Book. A somewhat different
version follows, from the Bahár-i-Dánush, or Spring of Knowledge, a
translation of which was given by Dr. Jonathan Scott in 1799. The story is
also known to the Jews; and two Hebrew versions are given, both from a
Parisian journal entitled Mélusine; 1885, tome ii. c. 542-6. A Siberian
version follows, from Radloff's Proben der Volksliteratur der türkischen
Stämme des Süd-Siberiens, vol. iii. s. 389; and next, a Turkish version,
from Mr. Gibb's translation of the Forty Vazírs, London, 1886; p. 105.
Curiously enough, a very similar version is found in Gaelic, and was
probably introduced into the Highlands by the Norsemen; see Campbell's
Popular Tales of West Highlands, vol. ii. p. 16. Mr. Clouston next
discusses the European versions of the story. Of these, the most important
is that in Boccaccio's Decamerone[160], Day 10. nov. 5, of which Professor
Morley has the following epitome:--

'Dianora, the wife of the rich Gilberto, being immodestly affected by
Messer Ansaldo, to free herself from his tedious importunity, she appointed
him to perform, in her judgment, an act of impossibility--namely, to give
her a garden as plentifully stored with fragrant flowers in January as in
the flourishing month of May. Ansaldo, by means of a bond which he made to
a magician, performed her request. Messer Gilberto, the lady's husband,
gave consent that his wife should fulfil her promise made to Ansaldo; who
hearing the bountiful mind of her husband released her of her promise, and
the magician likewise discharged Ansaldo, without taking aught of him.'

We may be sure that Boccaccio and Chaucer drew their versions from very
similar sources, as shewn by the introduction of the magician. At the same
time, we not only notice how Boccaccio has given Italian names to his
characters, but has even altered the chief circumstance on which the story
depends, by substituting a flower-garden in January for the removal of the
rocks. This notion he found ready to hand in the legend of St. Dorothea,
familiar to all readers of Massinger and Dekker's Virgin Martyr.

Beaumont and Fletcher dramatised Chaucer's story in their one-act play
called The Triumph of Honour, which forms one of the set entitled Four
Plays in One. They preserve the name Dorigen, though the husband is
Sophocles, duke of Athens, and the lover is Martius, a Roman general. They
also retain the notion of the removal of the rocks; for Dorigen exclaims:--

 'For here I vow unto the gods, these rocks,
  These rocks we see so fixed, shall be removed,
  Made champain field, ere I so impious prove
  To stain my lord's bed with adulterous love.'

The supposed miracle is achieved by Valerius, the brother of Martius, who
had been trained 'in the mathematics' by an 'old Chaldean.'

Finally, 'part of the plot of a comedy, printed in 1620, entitled The Two
Merry Milkmaids ... seems founded on Boccaccio's novel, yet the heroine's
name [Dorigena] is that of the lady in Chaucer's version.'

Tyrwhitt bids us remark that 'the long list of virtuous women in Dorigen's
soliloquy is plainly copied from Hieronymus contra Iouinianum.' Cf.
Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 293.


GROUP G.

§ 72. THE SECONDE NONNES TALE. There is a peculiar interest about this
Tale, because, as compared with the rest, it so clearly shews us Chaucer's
mode of compilation; his advance from close translation to a more free
handling of materials; and his change of rhythm, from stanzas to rimed
couplets. The closeness of the translation and the rhythm alike point to
early workmanship; and, most fortunately, we are not left to conjecture in
this matter, since our author himself refers to this piece, by the Title of
the Lyf of Seint Cecyle, in his Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, l.
426. It was probably written some time before the Legend. Dr. Furnivall
assigns to it the conjectural date of 1373, which many critics have
accepted[161]. The expression in l. 78, 'Yet preye I yow that _reden_ that
I wryte,' clearly shews that it was neither originally written as a tale of
the series, nor properly revised; and the expression in l. 62, 'And though
that I, unworthy _sone_ of Eve,' cannot fail to strike the reader as a
singular one to be put into the mouth of a _nun_. We possess, in fact, the
Tale in its original shape, without either revision or introduction; though
I fully suspect ll. 36-56, which are largely from Dante, was a later
insertion[162]. What is called the 'Prologue' is, in fact, nothing of the
sort; it is merely such an introduction as was suitable for the Legend at
the time of translation. We have no description of the Second Nun, no
introduction of her as a narrator, nor anything to connect the Tale with
those that precede it. There is no authority, indeed, for attributing it to
the Second Nun at all beyond the mere rubrics printed at pp. 509, 513, and
526 of vol. iv.

It is not even made quite clear to us who the Second Nun was. We may,
however, conclude that, as the Prioresse was herself a Nun, i.e. the
_first_ nun (see Prol. l. 118), the person intended is the 'Another Nonne'
mentioned in the Prologue, l. 163, but mentioned nowhere else. The first
line of the Canon's Yeoman's Prologue, G 554, merely mentions 'the lyf of
Seint Cecyle,' without any hint as to the supposed narrator of it. The
Prioress herself, on the other hand, is properly introduced to us, and her
Tale is carefully inserted in its right place.

An analysis of the so-called Prologue to this Tale is given in the Notes,
at the beginning; cf. note to l. 84. Tyrwhitt pointed out that the Tale
itself is translated from the Life of St. Cecilia as given in the Legenda
Aurea (or Golden Legend) of Jacobus Januensis, or Jacobus a Voragine, who
was archbishop of Genoa at the close of the thirteenth century; compare the
heading above, l. 85. But Dr. Kölbing has since shewn, in an able article
which appeared in Englische Studien, i. 215, that Tyrwhitt's suggestion is
only partially correct. As a matter of fact, Chaucer followed a Latin
original which agreed rather closely with the account in the Legenda Aurea
down to l. 348, or thereabouts. But _after_ this point (and in a few places
even _before_ it) his translation better agrees with another Latin Life of
St. Cecilia, derived from Simeon Metaphrastes. This account is quoted by
Dr. Kölbing from the printed edition in Historiae Aloysii Lipomani de vitis
sanctorum, pars II., Lovanii, 1571, p. 32; which he denotes by the symbol
'Lip.' Of this work, the only edition accessible to me is that entitled De
Vitis Sanctorum, ab Aloysio Lipomano, episcopo Veronae, a F. L. Surio
emendatis et auctis, Venetiis, 1581, p. 161; this I shall quote by the same
symbol, as I suppose there is no material difference between the two
editions.

The best text of the former Life of St. Cecilia (which I denote by 'LA') is
that given in the second edition of the Legenda Aurea by Dr. Th. Grässe,
published at Leipsic in 1850. Dr. Furnivall has printed it at length, from
Grässe's first edition, 1846, in his Originals and Analogues, Pt. ii. pp.
192-205; side by side with the French version of La Legende Dorée, as
translated by Jehan de Vignay, printed at Paris in 1513. The suggestion was
made in 'Bell's' edition of Chaucer (really edited by Mr. Jephson), that
Chaucer's original was not the Latin, but the French text. A very slight
comparison shews at once that this idea is wrong (as Dr. Furnivall points
out), and that Chaucer unquestionably followed one or more Latin versions.
It is, however, probable that Chaucer may have seen the French version
also, as he seems to have taken from it the idea of his first four stanzas,
ll. 1-28. But he has taken thence merely the general idea, and no more; see
notes to l. 1 and to l. 7. The Invocation to the Virgin bears some
resemblance to the Prioresses Prologue; see note to l. 50. It contains,
moreover, a passage (36-56) which is a free translation of one in Dante's
Paradiso; see note to l. 36. I may add here that Dr. Furnivall has also
reprinted two more lives of St. Cecilia, one from Caxton's Golden Legende,
in English prose, ed. 1483, fol. ccclxxvij, back; the other in English
verse, in a metre similar to that used by Robert of Gloucester, from MS.
Ashmole 43, leaf 185, back, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Another copy
of the latter, found in MS. Laud 108, is printed in the Early South-English
Legendary, ed. C. Horstmann, p. 490 (Early Eng. Text Society). There is yet
another Middle-English version, in short rimed lines, found in MS. Harl.
4196 and MS. Cott. Tib. E 7; it is printed (from the former MS.) in
Englische Studien, i. 235. These do not throw much further light upon the
matter; and, in fact, the chief texts worth consulting are the Latin one of
Jacobus a Voragine (or 'LA'), and the somewhat different version due to
Simeon Metaphrastes (or 'Lip.'). Of these Dunlop says, in his History of
Fiction, 3rd ed. p. 286--'The grand repertory of pious fiction seems to
have been the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus de Voragine, a Genoese Dominican, a
work entitled Golden from its popularity, on the same principle that this
epithet was bestowed on the 'Ass' of Apuleius. A similar composition in
Greek, by Simon Metaphrastes, written about the end of the tenth century,
was the prototype of this work of the thirteenth century, which comprehends
the lives of individual saints, whose history had already been written, or
was current from tradition. The Golden Legend, however, does not consist
solely of the lives of saints, but is said in the colophon to be
interspersed with many other beautiful and strange relations, which were
probably extracted from the Gesta Longobardorum, and other sources too
obscure and voluminous to be easily traced; indeed, one of the original
titles of the Legenda Aurea was Historia Lombardica. The work of [Jacobus
a] Voragine was translated into French by Jean de Vignai, and was one of
the three books from which Caxton's Golden Legend was compiled.'

Dr. Kölbing further shews that Chaucer also took a few particulars from the
Lives of Valerian and Tiburtius, as given in the Acta Sanctorum (April 14).
For a curious example of this, see note to l. 369, on the word
_corniculere_.

Dr. Kölbing's article should be consulted. I here subjoin only some of the
more important points. The numbers refer to the lines of the Tale, in Group
G.

85-348. Chiefly from LA. 189: 'for Ioye.' Cf. Lip.: [Urbanus] _magno
gaudio_ est affectus, ... et manibus in caelum extensis. LA has: ille manus
ad caelum expandens.

218, 9. Cf. Lip.: Inuenit Caeciliam orantem in cubiculo, et Angelum Domini
_stantem prope eam_. LA has: Caeciliam cum angelo loquentem in cubiculo
inuenit.

233. Lip.: _assensus es_; LA: credidisti.

265. Lip.: _Quomodo_ hoc cognouisti; LA: unde hoc nosti.

315. Lip.: et nos quoque cum eo puniemur, si inuenti fuerimus ad eum
ambulantes; LA: et nos in illius flammis pariter inuoluemur.

349-357. Lip.: _Tunc Valerianus deduxit fratrem suum ad_ sanctissimum
_Papam Vrbanum_. Cui postquam narrauit omnia ... benigno _Deo egit
gratias_. _Acceptum_ autem _cum omni gaudio et exultatione_ Tiburtium, cum
... _baptizasset_, &c. Quae quidem cum _perfecta_ fuissent _eius doctrina_,
post septem dies _Christi militem restituit_. Here LA merely has: Ductus
igitur et purificatus. Whence we see the importance of here consulting the
second Latin text. Many similar examples occur throughout the latter part
of the Tale, for which I must refer the reader to Dr. Kölbing's article and
to the Notes in vol. v.

The earliest English Life of St. Cecilia is the Anglo-Saxon version printed
at p. 149 of Cockayne's 'Shrine,' of which I here offer a rather close
translation:--

'On the 22nd day of this month [November] is the martyrdom of St. Cecilia,
the holy woman. She was wedded in her youth to a noble man, who was a
heathen; but she was a Christian. She was clothed with a hair-cloth upon
her body; and above the hair-cloth she was clothed with garments enwoven
with gold. And, on the night when she was led into the bride-chamber, she
said to the bridegroom that she saw an angel from heaven, who would slay
him with a sudden death if ever he touched her with unclean love. Then she
instructed the bridegroom, so that he received baptism, and believed in
God. When he was baptised, and entered the bride-chamber, then stood the
angel beside her with shining wings; and he had in his hand two crowns,
that sometimes glistened like rose-blossoms and sometimes like
lily-blossoms; and he gave one of the crowns to the woman, and the other to
the bridegroom, and said: "Keep ye these crowns by cleanly deeds, because I
have brought them to you from God's paradise."

'This woman suffered martyrdom for Christ. The prefect [lit. reeve] of the
city of Rome was named Almatheus, who strove to compel her to forsake
Christ; to which when she would not consent, he commanded her to be
enclosed in a boiling [lit. burning] bath, in which she remained, without
sweating, for a day and a night. Then the executioner approached her with a
sword, and struck her thrice therewith, but was unable to strike off her
head. But she commended herself to the pope, who was named Urbanus; and
then, in the pope's presence, distributed all that she had, and gave it
him, and said: "For three days' space I have prayed to the Lord that I
might give thee this, in order that thou mightest hallow my house for a
church." And thereupon she gave up her spirit to God.'

The Life of St. Cecilia occurs also in Ælfric's Lives of the Saints, as
given in MS. Julius E vii, a portion of which I have edited for the Early
English Text Society, though this passage is not as yet in type. I do not
find that this Life differs from that in the Aurea Legenda in any
particular that deserves especial mention, except that it is somewhat
briefer, and omits, as might be expected, the passage in Chaucer's Tale,
ll. 270-283.

The chief interest of the Life of St. Cecilia in Caxton's Golden Legende is
that, as Dr. Kölbing has shewn, his translation exhibits clear traces of
the influence of Chaucer. A single example will perhaps suffice. In l. 432,
Chaucer has: 'Of whennes comth thyn answering so rude?' And Caxton has:
'Fro whens cometh thy rude answer?' Yet neither of the Latin texts suggests
this exact expression. LA has: 'Unde tibi tanta praesumtio respondendi?'
Lip.: 'Undenam est tibi haec fiducia?'

In The Military and Religious Life in the Middle Ages, by Paul Lacroix, at
p. 426, is the following brief account of Saint Cecilia: 'Under the reign
of Alexander Severus, many illustrious martyrs were put to death: St.
Cecilia, her husband, and her brother-in-law among the number. St. Cecilia
was descended from a very ancient family which dated back to the time of
Tarquin the Proud; she belonged to the same house as Metella, many of whose
children were raised to the honours of triumph and of the consulate in the
heyday of the Roman republic. Her parents gave her in marriage to a young
Roman patrician, named Valerian. But Cecilia had dedicated her virginity to
God, and her husband, converted to the faith by her arguments and
entreaties, respected her vow, and himself converted his brother Tiburtius.
They all three relieved their persecuted brethren, and this Christian
charity betrayed them. In spite of their distinguished birth, their wealth
and their connexions, they were arrested, and their refusal to sacrifice to
the false gods led to their being condemned to death. We find a multitude
of analogous occurrences in Gaul, and also in the most distant provinces of
the East.' On the preceding page of the same book is figured a copy of a
piece of mosaic work of the third or fourth century, which was taken from
the cemetery of St. Sixtus, and is preserved in the church of St. Cecilia,
at Rome. It represents St. Cecilia and St. Valerian, with roses and lilies
in bloom at their feet, and having on each side of them a palm-tree laden
with fruit, a symbol of their victories and of their meritorious martyrdom.
Upon one of the palm-trees is a phoenix with a 'gloria' round its head, the
ancient symbol of resurrection.

The following interesting account of the church and statue of St. Cecilia
is extracted from Mrs. Jameson's beautiful work upon Sacred and Legendary
Art:--

'According to her wish, the house of Cecilia was consecrated as a church,
the chamber in which she suffered martyrdom being regarded as a spot of
peculiar sanctity. There is mention of a council held in the church of St.
Cecilia by Pope Symmachus, in the year 500. Afterwards, in the troubles and
invasions of the barbarians, this ancient church fell into ruin, and was
rebuilt by Pope Paschal I. in the ninth century. It is related that, while
engaged in this work, Paschal had a dream, in which St. Cecilia appeared to
him, and revealed the spot in which she lay buried; accordingly search was
made, and her body was found in the cemetery of Calixtus, wrapt in a shroud
of gold tissue, and round her feet a linen cloth dipt in her blood: near
her were the remains of Valerian, Tibertius, and Maximus, which, together
with hers, were deposited in the same church, now St.
Cecilia-in-Trastevere. The little room, containing her bath, in which she
was murdered or martyred, is now a chapel. The rich frescoes with which it
was decorated are in a state of utter ruin from age and damp; but the
machinery for heating the bath, the pipes, the stoves, yet remain. This
church, having again fallen into ruin, was again repaired, and sumptuously
embellished in the taste of the sixteenth century, by Cardinal Sfondrati.
On this occasion the sarcophagus containing the body of St. Cecilia was
opened with great solemnity in the presence of several cardinals and
dignitaries of the Church, among others Cardinal Baronius, who has given us
an exact description of the appearance of the body, which had been buried
by Pope Paschal in 820, when exhumed in 1599[163]. "She was lying," says
Baronius, "within a coffin of cypress wood, enclosed in a marble
sarcophagus; not in the manner of one dead and buried, that is, on her
back, but on her right side, as one asleep; and in a very modest attitude;
covered with a simple stuff of taffety, having her head bound with cloth,
and at her feet the remains of the cloth of gold and silk which Pope
Paschal had found in her tomb." Clement VIII ordered that the relics should
remain untouched, inviolate; and the cypress coffin was enclosed in a
silver shrine, and replaced under the altar. This re-interment took place
in presence of the pope and clergy, with great pomp and solemnity, and the
people crowded in from the neighbouring towns to assist at the ceremony.
Stefano Maderno, who was then in the employment of the Cardinal Sfondrati
as sculptor and architect, and acted as his secretary, was not, we may
suppose, absent on this occasion; by the order of the Cardinal he executed
the beautiful and celebrated statue of "St. Cecilia lying dead," which was
intended to commemorate the attitude in which she was found. It is thus
described by Sir Charles Bell:--"The body lies on its side, the limbs a
little drawn up; the hands are delicate and fine,--they are not locked, but
crossed at the wrists: the arms are stretched out. The drapery is
beautifully modelled, and modestly covers the limbs. The head is enveloped
in linen, but the general form is seen, and the artist has contrived to
convey by its position, though not offensively, that it is separated from
the body. A gold circlet is round the neck, to conceal the place of
decollation (?). It is the statue of a lady, perfect in form, and affecting
from the resemblance to reality in the drapery of white marble, and the
unspotted appearance of the statue altogether. It lies as no living body
could lie, and yet correctly, as the dead when left to expire,--I mean in
the gravitation of the limbs."

'It must be remembered that Cecilia did not suffer decollation; that her
head was _not_ separated from the body; and the gold band is to conceal the
wound in the neck; otherwise, this description of the statue agrees exactly
with the description which Cardinal Baronius has given of the body of the
saint when found in 1599.

'The ornaments round the shrine, of bronze and rare and precious marbles,
are in the worst taste, and do not harmonize with the pathetic simplicity
of the figure.

'At what period St. Cecilia came to be regarded as the patron saint of
music, and accompanied by the musical attributes, I cannot decide. It is
certain that in ancient devotional representations she is not so
distinguished; nor in the old Italian series of subjects from her life have
I found any in which she is figured as singing, or playing upon
instruments[164].'

§ 73. THE CANON'S YEOMAN'S PROLOGUE, AND TALE. The Prologue, as well as the
Tale itself, belongs to the very latest period of Chaucer's work. This is
clear at once, from its originality, as well as from the metre, and the
careless ease of the rhythm, which sometimes almost degenerates into
slovenliness, as though our author had written some of it in hot haste,
with the intention of revising it more carefully afterwards. Besides, the
poet has boldly improved upon his plan of the pilgrims' stories as laid
down in his Prologue. We have there no hint of the Canon nor of his Yeoman;
they are two new pilgrims who join themselves to the rest upon the road. A
dispute arising between the master and the man, the former is put out of
countenance, and actually rides away for very sorrow and shame (l. 702);
but the man remains, to denounce the cupidity of the alchemists and to
expose their trickery. Tyrwhitt remarks:--'The introduction of the Chanouns
Yeman to tell a tale, at a time when so many of the original characters
remain to be called upon, appears a little extraordinary. It should seem,
that some sudden resentment had determined Chaucer to interrupt the regular
course of his work, in order to insert a satire against the alchemists.
That their pretended science was much cultivated about this time, and
produced its usual evils, may fairly be inferred from the Act, which was
passed soon after, 5 Henry IV, cap. iv. to make it Felonie _to multiplie
gold or siluer, or to vse the art of multiplication_.' He adds--'The first
considerable coinage of gold in this country was begun by Edward III in the
year 1343, and according to Camden (in his Remains, art. _Money_), "the
Alchemists did affirm, as an unwritten verity, that the Rose-nobles, which
were coined soon after, were made by projection or multiplication
Alchemical of Raymund Lully in the Tower of London." Ashmole, in his
Theatrum Chemicum, p. 443, has repeated this ridiculous story concerning
Lully with additional circumstances, as if he really believed it; though
Lully, by the best accounts, had been dead above twenty years before Edward
III began to coin gold[165].'

The above-mentioned volume by Ashmole, entitled Theatrum Chemicum[166], is
a very singular production. And, perhaps, not the least singular
circumstance is that Ashmole actually gives 'The Tale of the Chanon's
Yeman, written by our ancient and famous poet, Geoffry Chaucer,' Prologue
and all, at full length (pp. 227-256), under the impression, apparently,
that Chaucer was really a believer in the science! He says--'One reason why
I selected out of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales that of the Chanon's Yeoman
was, to let the world see what notorious cheating there has beene ever
used, under pretence of this true (though injur'd) Science; Another is, to
shew that Chaucer himselfe was a Master therein.' It is indeed true that
Chaucer had examined into alchemy very closely; but it is perfectly clear
that he had made up his mind, with his strong English common sense, that
the whole matter was a delusion. Had he lived in the present century, he
could hardly have spoken out in more assured terms. In a similar manner he
had studied astrology, and was equally a disbeliever in all but the terms
of it and a few of its most general and vague assertions. He says
expressly, in his Treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. sec. 4, l.
36:--'natheles, thise ben observauncez of iudicial matiere and rytes of
payens [pagans], in which my spirit ne hath no feith, ne no knowing of hir
_horoscopum_.' But it is evident that the believers in alchemy had to make
the best use they could of Chaucer's language, by applying it as being
directed only against notorious cheats; and accordingly, we find in The
Ordinall of Alchimy, by Thomas Norton of Bristol, printed in Ashmole's
collection, various passages imitated from Chaucer, such as, e.g. that at
p. 17:--

 'The fals man walketh from Towne to Towne,
  For the most parte in a threed-bare Gowne,' &c.

And again, George Ripley, in his Compound of Alchymie, dedicated to King
Edward IV., printed in the same collection, says, at p. 153:--

 'Their Clothes be bawdy and woryn threde-bare,
  Men may them smell for Multyplyers where they go,' &c.[167]

Ashmole's work contains several treatises which profess to explain alchemy,
nearly all alike couched in mysterious, and often in ridiculous language.
Such are Norton's Ordinall of Alchimy, Ripley's Compound of Alchymie, Liber
Patris Sapientiae, Hermes Bird (really Lydgate's poem of The Churl and the
Bird), Chaucer's Canon's Yeoman's Tale (!), Pearce the Blacke Monke upon
the Elixir, Charnock's Breviary of Naturall Philosophy[168], Ripley's
Mistery of Alchymists, an extract from Gower's Confessio Amantis,
Aristotle's Secreta Secretorum, translated by Lydgate; and so on. On the
whole, the book is equally curious and dull.

It would hardly be possible to give much idea of alchemy in a brief space,
and it would certainly be unprofitable. The curious will find an excellent
article upon it (entitled 'Alchemy') in the new edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica; and a history of it, by no means uninteresting,
in the first volume of Thomson's History of Chemistry. In Whewell's History
of the Inductive Sciences, 2nd edition, 1847, vol. i. p. 320, the following
notice of it occurs, which I quote for the reader's convenience:--'Like
other kinds of Mysticism, Alchemy seems to have grown out of the notions of
moral, personal, and mythological qualities, which men associated with
terms, of which the primary application was to physical properties. This is
the form in which the subject is presented to us in the earliest writings
which we possess on the subject of chemistry, those of Geber of Seville,
who is supposed to have lived in the eighth or ninth century. The very
titles of Geber's works show the notions on which this pretended science
proceeds. They are, "Of the Search of Perfection;" "Of the Sum of
Perfection or of the Perfect Magistery;" "Of the Invention of Verity, of
Perfection." The basis of this phraseology is the distinction of metals
into more or less _perfect_; gold being the most perfect, as being the most
valuable, most beautiful, most pure, most durable; silver the next; and so
on. The "Search of Perfection" was, therefore, the attempt to convert other
metals into gold; and doctrines were adopted which represented the metals
as all compounded of the same elements, so that this was theoretically
possible. But the mystical trains of association were pursued much further
than this; gold and silver were held to be the most noble of metals; gold
was their King, and silver their Queen. Mythological associations were
called in aid of these fancies, as had been done in astrology. Gold was
Sol, the sun; silver was Luna, the moon; copper, iron, tin, lead, were
assigned to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The processes of mixture and heat
were spoken of as personal actions and relations, struggles and victories.
Some elements were conquerors, some conquered; there existed preparations
which possessed the power of changing the whole of a body into a substance
of another kind: these were called _magisteries_[169]. When gold and
quicksilver are combined, the king and the queen are married, to produce
children of their own kind. It will easily be conceived, that when chemical
operations were described in phraseology of this sort, the enthusiasm of
the fancy would be added to that of the hopes, and observation would not be
permitted to correct the delusion, or to suggest sounder and more rational
views.

'The exaggeration of the vague notion of perfection and power in the object
of the alchemist's search was carried further still. The same preparation
which possessed the faculty of turning baser metals into gold, was imagined
to be also a universal medicine, to have the gift of curing or preventing
diseases, prolonging life, producing bodily strength and beauty: the
_philosopher's stone_ was finally invested with every desirable efficacy
which the fancy of the "philosophers" could devise.'

See also Dr. Whewell's account of the doctrine of 'the four elements' in
the same work; vol. iii. p. 121.

The history of the rise and growth of the ideas involved in alchemy is ably
treated of in the article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica already referred
to; it is of some interest to note how some of the more important notions
were developed. From ancient Persia came the idea of a correspondence
between the heavenly bodies and parts of the human frame, alluded to in
Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, and in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, i.
3. 148[170]. From ancient India came the idea of a peregrination of sinful
souls through the animal, vegetable, and even the mineral world, till they
were absorbed into Deity. Hence was further evolved the notion of a
transmutation of elements. The Greeks held that different deities had under
their protection and guidance different types of men; an idea still
preserved in our words _mercurial_, _jovial_, and _saturnine_. The school
of Hippocrates held the doctrine of the four elements, or primary
substances of which all others were made, an idea first mentioned (it is
said) by Empedocles; to which Aristotle added a fifth element, that of
ether (Arist. de Caelo, i. 2). But this idea is probably older; for we find
five _bhútas_, or elements, enumerated in Sanskrit, viz. earth, water,
fire, air, and ether; see Benfey's Skt. Dict. s.v. _bhú_, p. 658. Another
very ancient notion is that male and female principles existed in all three
worlds alike, animal, vegetable, and mineral; from which it followed that
the union of two metals could produce a third. It was argued that
'monstrosities are the productions of diseased metals (really alloys),
which, if properly treated, may be cured, and will turn to gold, or at
least silver. The second stage in this imitation of nature is to obtain, by
tincture or projection, solid or liquid gold, the cure of all evils';
Encycl. Brit. i. 463, col. 2. This notion is still preserved in the word
_arsenic_ (Gk. [Greek: arsenikon], male). It was universally believed that
nature produced changes in the substance of various metals by slow degrees,
and the great object of alchemy was to produce the same changes quickly.
The chief names in connexion with the progress of alchemy are Geber, a
Sabaean, who flourished about A.D. 800; Avicenna, a native of Shiraz, born
A.D. 980, died June, 1037; Albertus Magnus, born about 1193, died Nov. 15,
1280, who uses much more intelligible language than alchemists usually
indulge in; Raymund Lully, born at Majorca in 1235, a scholar of Roger
Bacon, who was himself deeply imbued with the mystery of alchemy; Arnoldus
de Villa Nova (mentioned by Chaucer), so named because born at Villeneuve,
in Provence, in 1240; and others. Paracelsus[171], a Swiss physician (born
in 1493, died 1541) was somewhat better than a mere alchemist. He did
something towards destroying the notion of the necessity of consulting
astrological influences, and prepared the way for the discoveries of Van
Helmont (born at Brussels in 1577, died 1644), with whom the history of
modern chemistry may be said to begin. Van Helmont was the inventor of two
new terms, _gas_[172] and _blas_, the former of which remains in common
use, though the latter is wholly forgotten.

The great storehouse of treatises upon alchemy is the Latin collection, in
five volumes, called Theatrum Chemicum. I have made considerable use of the
edition of this work published in 1660, which I have frequently quoted in
the Notes. We hence gather that most of the authors upon the subject wished
men to believe that the true secrets of the science were known to
_themselves only_; yet they all learnt more or less of a certain jargon
which they continually repeated, attributing their empirical rules to
Hermes, or Geber, or other supposed masters. The same ideas, alleged
results, and supposed principles continually recur; and the brief statement
of a few of these will at once shew what the reader of an alchemical
treatise may expect to find. Much depended on the supposed powers of
certain numbers. Thus, there were _three_ primary colours, black, white,
and red[173], from which all others were produced by combination; Theat.
Chem. iv. 536. According to Gower, there were really _three_ kinds of the
philosopher's stone, viz. animal, vegetable, and mineral. Some said it was
composed of _three_ parts; body, spirit, and soul--_corpus_, _spiritus_,
and _anima_; Ashmole's Th. Ch. p. 382. Again, there were _four_ elements;
_four_ complexions of nature or temperaments; _four_ colours (said some),
viz. white, black, citrine (i.e. gold-coloured, with a purple tinge), and
red; _four_ savours, insipid, acid, sweet, and bitter; _four_ odours,
sweet, fetid, intense, and slight (_remissus_); Theat. Chem. iii. 82. In
particular, there were _four_ spirits, sulphur, sal ammoniac, quicksilver,
and arsenic; see note to line 778; also _four_ states or conditions, hot,
cold, wet, and dry; Theat. Chem. iv. 537. There were _seven_ planets; and
_because_ there were seven planets, it followed that every planet had a
corresponding note in the musical scale of _seven_ notes. Every planet had
its proper colour; and, in this view, there were _seven_ colours, sable,
vert, gules, or, argent, sanguine, and umber; Batman upon Bartholome, lib.
19, c. 37. Every planet had its proper metal; there were therefore _seven_
metals; see the extract from Gower, in the note to l. 820. Now, as all
substances are made of the same four elements, it follows that if a
substance can be decomposed, and reunited in different proportions, its
nature may be so changed that it shall become another substance. Many
substances, if subjected to heat, are destroyed; but metals are not so, and
therefore became the favourite subject for experiments. It was laid down
that one metal could be transmuted into another, but only after having been
first reduced into its primary elements; Theat. Chem. iv. 531. Ere long, it
was accepted as an axiom that all baser metals could be transmuted either
into gold (or _sol_), typified by the sun, or into silver (or _luna_),
typified by the moon; these being the two extremes between which the other
five metals were ranged. It was agreed that the chief agents in producing
this transmutation were quicksilver and sulphur, and of these quicksilver
was the more important; so much so, that the mention of quicksilver meets
us everywhere, and no alchemist could work without it[174]. It was also
agreed that certain processes must be gone through in a due order,
generally ten or twelve in number; and if _any one_ of them failed, the
whole work had to be begun afresh. They are commonly described as (1)
calcination, (2) solution, (3) separation of the elements, (4) conjunction,
(5) putrefaction, (6) coagulation, (7) cibation, (8) sublimation, (9)
fermentation, (10) exaltation, (11) augmentation or multiplication; and
(12) projection; Theat. Chem. ii. 175, and Ripley's Compound of Alchemy. By
insisting on the necessity of all these processes, alchemists sufficiently
guarded against all chances of an unfavourable result, viz. by securing
that a result could not very well be arrived at.

The moment that we attempt to analyse their processes more closely, we are
met by two difficulties that are simply insuperable: the first, that the
same name is clearly used to denote quite different substances; and the
second, that the same substance is called by many different names. Hence
also arose endless evasions, and arrogant claims to pretended secrets; it
was often said that the quicksilver of the alchemists was a substance only
known to adepts, and that those who used only ordinary quicksilver knew
nothing of the matter. The master could thus always mystify his pupils, and
make it appear that he alone, and no one else, knew what he was talking
about.

Yet it was frequently alleged that the experiments _did_ succeed. The
easiest explanation of this matter is, that the hopes of the alchemists
were doubtless buoyed up by the fact that every now and then the
experiments _appeared_ to succeed; and it is easy to shew how. The close
affinity of quicksilver for gold is well known. I copy the following from a
book on experiments, which really suffices to explain the whole matter. 'If
a sovereign be rubbed with mercury, it will lose its usual appearance, and
appear as if silvered over[175]; the attraction of the gold for the mercury
being sufficient to cause a coating of it to remain. When it is wished to
remove the silvery appearance, dip the sovereign in a dilute solution of
nitric acid, which will entirely take it off.' Now the alchemists tell us
that quicksilver must always be used in all experiments; and they
constantly recommend the introduction into the substances experimented on
of a _small_ quantity of gold, which they thought would be increased. The
experiments constantly failed; and whenever they failed, the pieces of
molten metal were carefully saved, to be used over and over again. The
frequent introduction of small quantities of gold caused that metal to
accumulate; and if, by any favourable process, the quicksilver was
separated from the mass, a considerable quantity of gold would now and then
actually appear. This account is so much in accordance with all that we
read, that we may confidently accept the conclusion of Dr. Thomson, the
author of the History of Chemistry, that the vaunted philosopher's stone
was certainly an _amalgam of gold_; which, 'if projected into melted lead
or tin, and afterwards cupellated, would leave a portion of gold; all the
gold, of course, that existed previously in the amalgam.' He adds that 'the
alchemists who prepared the amalgam could not be ignorant that it contained
gold'; a statement which I am inclined to modify by suggesting that it may
very easily have contained _more gold than they supposed it did_. In a
word, we may conclude that some deceived themselves, and others were
conscious cheats.


GROUP H.

§ 74. THE MANCIPLE'S PROLOGUE. In the black-letter editions, this Prologue
begins with the 16 lines printed at p. 289 (vol. iv) as the Epilogue to the
Nonne Prestes Tale; because, in them, that Tale precedes. See remarks on §
51 above (p. 433).

The Prologue is self-explanatory; we see how the responsibility passed from
the Cook to the Manciple. It is curious that the Cook is addressed as if he
had told no Tale hitherto; see, as to this, the remarks on § 28 above (p.
399).

§ 75. THE MAUNCIPLES TALE. With respect to this story, Tyrwhitt briefly
remarks that 'The Fable of the Crow has been related by so many authors,
from Ovid down to Gower, that it is impossible to say whom Chaucer
principally followed. His skill in new dressing an old story was never,
perhaps, more successfully exerted.'

Chaucer was so familiar with Ovid, and, in particular, with the
Metamorphoses, that we may fairly suppose that this was the real source of
his Tale; see Metam. ii. 534-632. The last line of his story (H 308),
excluding the moral, closely agrees in sense with the last line in Ovid's
tale--'Inter aues albas uetuit considere coruum.'

Gower's story is in his Confessio Amantis, bk. iii, ed. Pauli, i. 305-6;
but it is so briefly sketched, in 35 lines, that Chaucer could have derived
nothing from it, even if he had wished to do so.

Another Middle-English analogue, much more important than Gower's, is the
story of the Magpie, being the 10th Tale in the collection known as The
Seven Sages, printed in Weber's Metrical Romances, iii. 86. It is much the
same as the story of the Popinjay in Wright's edition of the Seven Sages,
p. 73. The version in the Seven Sages clearly points to an Eastern origin
for the story. See Mr. Clouston's essay on The Tell-tale Bird, in Originals
and Analogues (Chaucer Soc.), p. 437; to which I refer the reader for
further information.

Dr. Köppel[176] has shewn that several passages in the moral advice with
which the Tale concludes (including nearly the whole of lines H 325-358),
are taken from a work by Albertano of Brescia, entitled De Arte Loquendi et
Tacendi, written in 1245, and newly edited by Thor Sundby in the second
Appendix to his work called Brunetto Latinos levnet og skrifter (Life and
Writings of Brunetto Latino), Copenhagen, 1869. See further in my Notes.


GROUP I.

§ 76. THE PARSON'S PROLOGUE. Most copies place this after the Manciples
Tale, and insert the word _maunciple_ in the first line. The black-letter
edition of 1542 added the spurious Plowman's Tale _after_ the Parson's,
i.e. at the end of all. But all the later editions in black-letter inserted
this spurious Tale _before_ the Parson's, and hence the editors had to
alter the word _maunciple_ (above) into _Plowman_; which they did.

The Persones Tale was clearly meant to come last (I 47), and there is an
allusion to the hour of 4 P. M. (I 5, and note). The Maunciples Tale well
precedes it, because the Prologue to that Tale says they were approaching
Canterbury (H 2, 3). But there is a great difficulty in the mention of the
early morning (H 16); and this is why Group I has to be taken as a separate
Fragment.

The reading _Foure_, in l. 5, is explained and justified in the Notes.

Some German commentators have endeavoured to discover the date of the Tales
from lines 10, 11, by giving these lines a wholly gratuitous and impossible
interpretation, as if they were meant to express that the moon's position
was in Libra! But Chaucer says nothing of the sort; he is speaking of the
moon's exaltation, and adds, parenthetically, 'I mean (to say) Libra.'
Unluckily, he happens to go wrong; for Libra was the exaltation of Saturn:
but this does not alter the fact, that _exaltation_ never denotes position,
but was a common astrological term. It invariably refers to _a sign of the
Zodiac_; and although Chaucer, for the moment, forgot to which planet Libra
caused an exaltation or increase of strength, he really _did_ know the
meaning of one of the commonest terms in all astrology. It is much to be
regretted that theories should be founded on such gross misconceptions.

§ 77. THE PERSONES TALE. It is now known that this Tale is little else than
an adaptation (with alterations, omissions, and additions, as usual with
Chaucer) of a French treatise by Frère Lorens, entitled La Somme des Vices
et des Vertus, written in 1279. The English work by Dan Michel of
Northgate, usually known by the title of The Ayenbite of Inwyt, or Remorse
of Conscience, is a much more literal and closer translation of the same
treatise, and thus affords a good guide for comparison between Chaucer and
the French original. The French treatise has never been printed, but exists
in two MSS. in the British Museum[177], viz. Cleop. A v, and Royal 19 C ii.

An excellent dissertation on this Tale, in which a close comparison with
its original is duly made, was written in German by Dr. W. Eilers in 1882,
and has been rendered more accessible to Chaucer students by an English
translation made in 1884, and printed in Essays on Chaucer (Chaucer Soc.),
p. 501. Of this Essay I have made much use in the Notes, to which I refer
the reader for further information.

It is clear that this Tale was once an independent Treatise (see § 104, in
vol. iv. p. 644), which people could either 'herkne or rede'; and it was
probably written before 1380, at much the same time as the Tale of
Melibeus, which it somewhat resembles in style. It was obvious that, if
this treatise was to be inserted among the Canterbury Tales, it could only
be assigned to the Parson, who is made, accordingly, to warn the company
that he dislikes rime, and can only tell them 'a mery tale in prose'; see I
46. The word _mery_ sometimes meant what we should now call 'interesting';
and it probably interested a much larger number of people in those days
than it can possibly do at the present time. Our ancestors, at times,
certainly inclined to serious discourses, such as the present age has no
relish for.

It is quite clear that a few paragraphs near the end (iv. 644, I
1084-90)--beginning with _and namely_, and ending with _my soule_--were
inserted at a much later time, probably on one of the last occasions when
the poet revised his work. This passage has sometimes been called his
'Retractation'; but this term is a bad one[178]. The phrase used is 'the
whiche I revoke in my _retracciouns_,' i.e. among the things which I
disclaim; and the word _revoke_, i.e. recall, means that he wishes to
disclaim many of his works, as being deficient in such theological merit as
would conduce to the salvation of his soul; a disclaimer which he at once
follows up by thanking 'oure lord and his blisful moder and alle the
seintes,' for such works as were of a moral and meritorious character. This
I believe to be the real meaning, and to refer to the prevalent idea that
many evil deeds and sayings could be out-balanced, even at the last moment,
by an appeal to a few good actions; of which medieval literature affords us
many examples. Perhaps it is fair to add that the poet had good cause to
regret such Tales as those of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant.

In Essays on Chaucer, p. 227, is printed an Essay on this Tale by H. Simon,
of Schmalkalden. The object of the Essay is to prove that Chaucer was a
Wycliffite; and, filled with this idea (the truth of which I am not
particularly careful either to deny or assert), the author endeavours to
shew that the Persones Tale is full of interpolations made by some
designing and fraudulent person. He even goes so far as to give us what he
considers to be 'the original Tale' (p. 283). The French text tends to
upset at least some portions of this superfluous theory, and Dr. Köppel has
written an excellent article[179] to shew--what to a plain person needs but
little proof--that the Persones Tale is to be considered as wholly genuine,
inasmuch as a considerable number of conspicuous passages reappear, in a
slightly modified form, in other parts of the Canterbury Tales. If we are
to go through the Tales, picking out, and setting aside as spurious, every
passage which does not please us, the result can only be unsatisfactory.
Different readers will eliminate different phrases and opinions, and the
residuum will be valueless. I see no reason why we may not be content with
the Tales in the form presented by the best MSS.


POSTSCRIPT.

P. 395.--In a small book by Professor G. Stephens, entitled Förteckning
öfver de fornämsta Brittiska och Fransyska Handskrifterna i Stockholm
(Stockholm, 1847), at p. 20, is a description of a MS. which contains a
copy of Palamon and Arcite in French verse, and was written early in the
fifteenth century. It is remarkable that the metre is the same as that of
the Knightes Tale; from which, perhaps, it was borrowed.

In Anglia, XVI. 261, L. Fränkel, of Munich, reprints a Latin fable by
Casparus Cropacius, which first appeared in 1581, in illustration of the
Milleres Tale. This fable follows Chaucer closely in the principal details,
but omits the humour of the original. I fail to see any merit in this form
of the story, and therefore refrain from reproducing it.

P. 423. See Dr. Jessopp's article on 'William of Norwich' in The Nineteenth
Century, May, 1893.

FOOTNOTES.

  [1] It is also mentioned as 'the book of Fame' at the end of the Persones
      Tale, I 1086. I accept this passage as genuine.

  [2] In Dante's Inferno, this invocation begins Canto II.; for Canto I.
      forms a general introduction to the whole.

  [3] Where Chaucer says 'leet the reynes goon' (l. 951), and Dante has
      'abbandonò li freni' (Inf. xvii. 107), we find in Ovid 'equi ...
      colla iugo eripiunt, abruptaque lora relinquunt' (Met. ii. 315).
      Chaucer's words seem closer to Dante than to the Latin original.

  [4] On which Prof. Lounsbury remarks (Studies in Chaucer, ii. 243)--'More
      extreme indeed than that of any one else is the position of Professor
      Skeat. He asserts in all seriousness that the "House of Fame" is the
      translation to which reference is made by Lydgate, when he said that
      Chaucer wrote "Dante in English." Beyond this utterance it is hardly
      possible to go.' This is mere banter, and entirely misrepresents my
      view. Lydgate does not say that 'Dant in English' was a translation;
      this is a pure assumption, for a strategical purpose in argument.
      Lydgate was ignorant of Italian, and has used a stupid phrase, the
      correctness of which I by no means admit. But he certainly meant
      _something_; and the prominence which he gives to "Dant in English,"
      when he comes to speak of Chaucer's Minor Poems, naturally suggests
      The House of Fame, which he otherwise omits! My challenge to 'some
      competent critic' to tell me what _other_ poem is here referred to,
      remains unanswered.

  [5] When Chaucer consulted Dante, his thoughts were naturally directed to
      Vergil. We find, accordingly, that he begins by quoting (in ll.
      143-8) the opening lines of the Æneid; and a large portion of Book I
      (ll. 143-467) is entirely taken up with a general sketch of the
      contents of that poem. It is clear that, at the time of writing,
      Vergil was, in the main, a new book to him, whilst Ovid was certainly
      an old acquaintance.

  [6] By this, I only mean that Lydgate seems to have been indebted to
      Chaucer for the general idea of his poem, and even for the title of
      it (cf. Ho. Fame, 120). For a full account of all its sources, see
      the admirable edition of Lydgate's Temple of Glas by Dr. J. Schick,
      p. cxv. (Early Eng. Text Society).

  [7] Misprinted 'bright,' as the final _e_ has 'dropped out' at press; of
      course it should be the adverbial form, with final _e_. In l. 507,
      the form is 'brighte' again, where it is the plural adjective. And,
      owing to this repetition, MSS. F. and B. actually omit lines 504-7.

  [8] Morris has _rabewyures_, from MS. F.; but there is no such word in
      his Glossary. See the New E. Dictionary, s.v. _Baboon_.

  [9] Morris has _Reues_; but his Glossary has: '_Reues_, or _reyes_, sb. a
      kind of dance.' Of course it is plural.

 [10] Morris has _clywe_; and his Glossary has '_Clywe_, v. to turn or
      twist'; but no such verb is known. See _Claw_, v. § 3, in the New E.
      Dict.

 [11] Morris has _frot_; but it does not appear in the Glossary.

 [12] I do not here endorse all Ten Brink's dates. I give his scheme for
      what it is worth, as it is certainly deserving of consideration.

 [13] It is the stanza next following the last one quoted in vol. i. p. 23.
      I quote it from the Aldine edition of Chaucer, ed. Morris, i. 80.

 [14] Of course Lydgate knew the work was unfinished; so he offers a
      humorous excuse for its incompleteness. I may here note that Hoccleve
      refers to the Legend in his poem entitled the Letter of Cupid, where
      Cupid is made to speak of 'my Legende of Martres'; see Hoccleve's
      Works, ed. Furnivall, p. 85, l. 316.

 [15] In December, 1384, Richard II. 'held his Christmas' at Eltham
      (Fabyan).

 [16] I think lines 568, 569 (added in B.) are meant to refer directly to
      ll. 703, 704.

 [17] The Knightes Tale is a clear exception. The original Palamon and
      Arcite was too good to be wholly lost; but it was entirely recast in
      a new metre, and so became quite a new work.

 [18] It is amusing to see that Chaucer forgot, at the same time, to alter
      A. 422 (= B. 432), in which Alcestis actually tells her name. The
      oversight is obvious.

 [19] Line A. 277 reappears in the Canterbury Tales in the improved
      form--'And ever a _thousand_ gode ageyn oon badde.' This is the 47th
      line in the Milleres Prologue, but is omitted in Tyrwhitt's edition,
      together with the line that follows it.

 [20] I.e. with the exception of the stanzas which were transferred from
      that work to the Man of Lawes Prologue and Tale; see the 'Account of
      the Sources,' &c. p. 407, and the last note on p. 307 of the present
      volume.

 [21] I omit 'Marcia Catoun'; like Esther, she is hardly to be ranked with
      the heroines of olden fables. Indeed, even Cleopatra comes in rather
      strangely.

 [22] See De Claris Mulieribus:--Cleopatra, cap. 86. Thisbe, cap. 12. Dido,
      cap. 40. Hypsipyle and Medea, capp. 15, 16. Lucretia, cap. 46.
      Hypermnestra cap. 13. And see Morley's English Writers, v. 241
      (1890).

 [23] It will be seen below that Chaucer certainly made use of this work
      for the Legend of Hypermnestra; see p. xl.

 [24] Court of Love (original edition, 1561), stanzas 15, 16. I substitute
      'ninetene' for the 'xix' of the original.

 [25] 'The Jesuit Rapin, in his Latin poem entitled "Horti" (Paris, 1666),
      tells how a Dalmatian virgin, persecuted by the amorous addresses of
      Vertumnus, prayed to the gods for protection, and was transformed
      into a tulip. In the same poem, he says that the Bellides (cf.
      _bellis_, a daisy), who were once nymphs, are now flowers. The story
      [here] quoted [from Henry Phillips] seems to have been fabricated out
      of these two passages.'--Athenæum, Sept. 28, 1889.

 [26] M. Tarbé shews that the cult of the daisy arose from the frequent
      occurrence of the name Marguérite in the royal family of France, from
      the time of St. Louis downward. The wife of St. Louis was Marguérite
      de Provence, and the same king (as well as Philip III., Philip IV.,
      and Philip V.) had a daughter so named.

 [27] Chaucer nearly suffered the same fate himself; see Ho. Fame, 586.

 [28] Dr. Köppel notes that the name also occurs in Boccaccio's Amorosa
      Visione (V. 50) in company with that of Claudian: 'Claudiano, Persio,
      ed _Agatone_.'--Anglia, xiv. 237.

 [29] He should also have excepted Philomela.

 [30] These numbers refer to the lines of the B-text of the Prologue.

 [31] Cf. L. G. W. 2177, 2227.

 [32] Cf. L. G. W. 1952-8.

 [33] Gower is amusing when he turns Ovid's 'Ad uada Maeandri' (Her. vii.
      2) into a reference to 'King Menander'!

 [34] The unfamiliar form _Guido_ was read as _Ouide_, by changing _G_,
      _o_, into _O_, _e_.

 [35] Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, ii. 259) objects that many scholars
      suppose that Valerius Flaccus was unknown previously to 1416. But, if
      so, how did Chaucer know that the title of his poem was 'Argonauticon
      Libri,' and not 'Argonautae,' as in Dares?

 [36] In fact, St. Augustine tells the whole story; De Ciuitate Dei, lib.
      i. cap. xix. And it was copied from St. Augustine's version into the
      Gesta Romanorum, Tale 135.

 [37] For lines 1896-8, Bech refers us to Godfrey of Viterbo's Speculum
      Regum; see the extract from it in Pertz, Monumenta Germanica, vol.
      xxii. p. 38, l. 159; which tells us that the teaching of philosophy
      and of the seven sciences at Athens was introduced there by Jupiter;
      see further, at p. lvi.

 [38] We must remember that, in olden times, writers often had to trust to
      their memory for details not always at hand. Hence such a mistake as
      this was easily made.

 [39] The reference seems to be to Paulus Orosius, Hist. i. 11; but Belus
      is not there mentioned. Yet Hyginus (Fab. 168) has: 'Danaus Beli
      filius ex pluribus coniugibus quinquaginta filias habuit.' See
      Anglia, v. 350.

 [40] People were soon called 'old' in those days. Dante, at 35, was in the
      'middle' of life; after which, all was downhill. Hoccleve was
      miserably old at 53; Works, ed. Furnivall, p. 119. Jean de Meun, in
      his Testament, ed. Méon, iv. 9, even goes so far as to say that man
      flourishes up to the age of 30 or 40, after which he 'ne fait que
      langorir.' Premature age seems to have been rather common in medieval
      times. Moreover, Gower is speaking _comparatively_, as of one no
      longer 'in the floures of his youthe.'

 [41] Ten Brink, Chaucer's Sprache, &c., p. 174.

 [42] The heroic couplet was practically unknown to us till Chaucer
      introduced it. The rare examples of it before his time are almost
      accidental. A lyrical poem printed in Böddeker's Altenglische
      Dichtungen, p. 232, from MS. Harl. 2253, ends with a fair specimen,
      and is older than Chaucer. The last two lines are:--

       'For loue of vs his wonges waxeþ þunne,
        His herte-blod he [gh]ef for al mon-kunne.'

      The oldest single line of this form is at the end of Sawles Warde
      (ab. A.D. 1210); see Spec. of English, pt. i. p. 95:--

       'That ich mot iesu crist mi sawle [gh]elden.'

 [43] Not 1491, as Bell says; he has mistaken the line.

 [44] From _geten_ to _gayler_; Dr. Furnivall has not got this quite right.

 [45] This excellent essay investigates Chaucer's sources, and is the best
      commentary upon the present poem. I had written most of my Notes
      independently, and had discovered most of his results for myself.
      This does not diminish my sense of the thoroughness of the essay, and
      I desire to express fully my acknowledgments to this careful student.
      I may remark here that Chaucer's obligations to Froissart were long
      ago pointed out by Tyrwhitt, and that the name Agatho was explained
      in Cary's Dante. There is very little else that Bech has missed.
      Perhaps I may put in some claim to the discovery of a sentence taken
      from Boethius; and to some other points of minor importance.

 [46] I.e. haste, rapidity. Cf. 'Rydynge ful _rapely_;' Piers the Plowman,
      B. xvii. 49.

 [47] See Part ii. sect. 1, l. 4; sect. 3, l. 11. 'Obviously, nobody
      putting a hypothetical case in that way to a child would go out of
      his way to name with a past verb [see the second case] a date still
      in the future.'--Morley's Eng. Writers, v. 270. Similarly, the
      expression 'I wolde knowe,' in the former case, precludes a date in
      the _past_; and hence we are driven to conclude that the date refers
      to time present. Curiously enough, there is an exactly parallel case.
      Blundevill's Description of Blagrave's Astralabe, printed at London
      by William Stansby, is undated. Turning to his Proposition VI, p.
      615, we find--'As for example, I would know the Meridian Altitude of
      the Sun y^e first of July, 1592.' The same date, 1592, is again
      mentioned, at pp. 619, 620, 621, 636, and 639, which renders it
      probable that the book was printed in that year.

       'Neither his _collect_, ne his _expans yeres_,
        Ne his _rotes_, ne his othere geres'; F 1275-6.

 [49] Not wishing to enforce this view upon every reader, and in order to
      save trouble in reference, I have numbered these sections 44 and 45.
      But if they belong, as I suppose, to Part iv., they should have been
      named 'Part iv. Canon 1,' and 'Part iv. Canon 2' respectively.

 [50] 'A smal instrument portatif aboute'; Prol. l. 52 (p. 177).

 [51] 'The almikanteras in thyn Astrolabie been compouned by two and two.'
      Part ii. sect. 5, l. 1.

 [52] Mr. Bradshaw gave me the hint; I afterwards found this remark by
      Selden, in his Preface to Drayton's Polyolbion: 'his [Chaucer's]
      Treatise of the Astrolabe, which I dare swear was chiefly learned out
      of Messahalah.'

 [53] Macha-allah or Messahala, an Arabian astronomer, by religion a Jew,
      flourished towards the end of the eighth century. Latin translations
      of four of his works (_not_ including the Treatise on the Astrolabe)
      have been printed, and were published at Nuremberg in 1549. A list of
      his works is given in Casiri (Bibl. Arab.-hisp. tom. 1er. pag. 434),
      and in the Biographie Universelle.

 [54] This splendid MS., of the _thirteenth_ century, is dated 1276, and
      illustrated with beautifully executed coloured diagrams. It is a
      storehouse of information about the Astrolabe, and I have often
      consulted it.

 [55] It is printed in full in my edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe, published
      for the Early Eng. Text Society in 1872, at pp. 88-104.

 [56] In my edition of the 'Astrolabe' for the Early Eng. Text Society
      (1872), I have inserted a large number of examples of strange
      blunders in the printed editions.

 [57] There are two astrolabes in Merton College, besides a plate
      exhibiting astronomical tables. These are all described in a paper
      entitled 'Remarks on an Astrolabe belonging to F. A. Hyett, Esq.,'
      written by my friend Robert Taylor, M.A., and printed in the
      Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archæological
      Society, vol. xii. Mr. Taylor further describes two Astrolabes in the
      British Museum.

 [58] This word has several senses in Chaucer. It means (1) the discs of an
      astrolabe; (2) a set of tablets; (3) astronomical tables; and (4) the
      game of 'tables.'

 [59] '_Pertuis_: m. A hole. _Pertuis de l'Araigne_, the centre of an
      Astrolabe; the hole wherein all the tables thereof are, by a pin or
      naile, joined together.'--Cotgrave's French Dictionary.

 [60] As far as I can ascertain.

 [61] Here insert--[they mene]--which CP omit.

 [62] The words from _euene_ to _climat_ are added at the bottom of the
      page in the MS.

 [63] Really _ten_; for _rout-e_ is dissyllabic.

 [64] _Misprinted_ wo; cf. _two_, l. 2093.

 [65] Imitated from Parl. of Foules, 693.

 [66] Cf. Book Duch. 1332.

 [67] From Parl. of Foules, 696.

 [68] There _are_ such accounts; but they are probably copied from Chaucer,
      who seems to have invented this transformation himself. See Notes and
      Queries, 7 Ser. vi. 186, 309, 372.

 [69] Not twentieth; for Legend IV contains two heroines.

 [70] The MS. has _shete_, an obvious error for _swete_, the alliteration
      being on _sw_. But the editors print _shene_.

 [71] Not 'formator,' as in Bell's note; a contraction for 'um' is added.

 [72] This is doubtless quoted from some gloss upon Ptolemy, not from the
      work itself. The reference is right, for the 'motus celi' are
      discussed in the Almagest, lib. i. c. 8.

 [73] This star ([alpha] Arietis) was on the supposed horn of the Ram, and
      hence its name; since _El-nâtih_ signifies 'the butter,' and
      'El-nath' is 'butting' or 'pushing.' See Ideler, Die Bedeutung der
      Sternnamen, p. 135.

 [74] Well expressed by Dante, Parad, xxx. 38--

               'Noi semo usciti fuore
        Del maggior _corpo_ al ciel ch'é pura luce.'

      Dante, like Chaucer, makes the eighth sphere that of fixed stars, and
      the ninth the _primum mobile_ or swiftest heaven (_ciel
      velocissimo_); Parad, xxvii. 99.

 [75] Here follows a table, shewing that, in _Aries_, the value of _Saturn_
      is 5, of _Jupiter_ 5, &c.; with the values of the planets in all the
      other signs. The value 5, of Saturn, is obtained by adding a
      _triplicite_ (value 3) to a _terme_ (value 2), these being the
      'witnesses' of Saturne in Aries; and so on throughout.

 [76] So on p. 12 of another tract (D) in the same MS., we find--

            '_Aries calidu_m _& sucu_m; _bonu_m.
        Nill capiti noceas, Aries cum lu_n_a refulget,
        De vena minuas & balnea tuti_us_ intres,
        Non tangas Aures, nec barbam radere debes.'

      Each of the signs is described in similar triplets, from the grammar
      of which I conclude that _Aries_ is here put for _in Ariete_, in the
      first hexameter.

 [77] 1385 is also the date of the latest allusion in the Canterbury Tales;
      see note to B 3589.

 [78] King John of France travelled from Canterbury to Dover (16 miles) on
      Sunday, July 5, 1360; but he heard mass in the cathedral before
      starting.--Temporary Pref. to the Six-text Edition, p. 131.

 [79] Tyrwhitt says 'at least one Tale'; but see Prol. 792. The fact is
      that Chaucer himself tacitly modified his plan afterwards, and
      altered the _two_ tales to _one_; see the Parson's Prologue, I 16-29.

 [80] Warton wrongly adds, or the Host. But the Host was the umpire, not a
      tale-teller himself.

 [81] The term 'link,' and such terms as 'head-link,' 'end-link,' and the
      like, are to be found in the Six-text edition published by the
      Chaucer Society, whence I have copied them.

 [82] In 1749, the coach from Edinburgh to Glasgow, forty-four miles, took
      two days for the journey. Twenty miles a day was fast. We may allow
      the pilgrims about fifteen miles a day. See Chambers' Book of Days,
      ii. 228. Once more, it is absurd to suppose Chaucer capable of
      proposing to crowd about sixty tales or so into a single day! A day
      of ten hours would, with interruptions, leave each speaker less than
      ten minutes apiece. See also Temporary Pref. to the Six-text, p. 119,
      shewing that Queen Isabella, in 1358, arrived at Canterbury from
      London in three or four days; stopping at Dartford, Rochester, and
      Ospringe. From the same, p. 129, we find that King John of France
      went from London to Eltham, June 30, 1360 (Tuesday); to Dartford
      (Wednesday); to Rochester (Thursday); to Ospringe (Friday); and to
      Canterbury (Saturday). Cf. Notes and Queries, 8th S. i. 474, 522.

 [83] By 'B 5' I mean Group B, l. 5, as numbered in the Chaucer Society's
      Six-text edition; the arrangement of which I have adopted throughout.

 [84] See note to l. 8 of the Prologue.

 [85] Except as regards convenience of reference. It was Dr. Furnivall who
      placed C more forward; nothing is gained by it, and it complicates
      references. I heartily wish this had never been done.

 [86] Tyrwhitt suggests the same thing, in a note to his Introductory
      Discourse.

 [87] In the Proem, the Nun calls herself an 'unworthy _son_ of Eve'; G 62.

 [88] See the extracts from Chaucer's Book of the Duchess as compared with
      some from Machault's Remède de Fortune in Furnivall's Trial
      Forewords, p. 47, where he quotes from Étude sur G. Chaucer, by M.
      Sandras, p. 290. Or consult the Notes, in vol. i., to the Book of the
      Duchesse, ll. 155, 250, 634, 779, 805, 919, 950, 1037.

 [89] Observe particularly this rime of _complain_ with _plein_. This shews
      whence Chaucer derived such rimes as _seke_, _seke_; Prol. 17, 18.
      There is a poem of 92 lines called Le Dit de la Harpe, printed in
      Bartsch's Crestomathie Française, p. 408, in which more than half the
      rimes are of this character.

 [90] It is none too clear who are meant by 'the parson and his companion.'
      Perhaps it means the Parson and the Ploughman (his brother).

 [91] Observe this substitution of _one_ Tale for _two_, tacitly accepted
      by Chaucer's readers as better suiting the circumstances.

 [92] This statement, that the Frere was 'a grey frere,' is of some
      interest.

 [93] See Morley's English Writers, vi. 115-8, where an analysis of the
      Tale is given.

 [94] I.e. thorpe, village; I quote from the edition of 1561. Broughton is
      an error for Boughton.

 [95] Ed. 'as ye'; which gives no sense.

 [96] For a good account of the Tabard Inn and a discussion of the
      pilgrims, see Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, by J. Saunders, ed. 1889.

 [97] Compare the articles by Koch and Kölbing, in Englische Studien, i.
      249, ii. 528, and in Essays on Chaucer, p. 357.

 [98] 'In describing the commencement of this amour, which is to be the
      subject of the remainder of the poem, Chaucer has entirely departed
      from his author in three principal circumstances, and, I think, in
      each with very good reason, (1) By supposing Emilia to be seen first
      by Palamon, he gives him an advantage over his rival which makes the
      catastrophe more consonant to poetical justice. (2) The picture which
      Boccaccio has exhibited of two young princes violently enamoured of
      the same object, without jealousy or rivalship, if not absolutely
      unnatural, is certainly very insipid and unpoetical. (3) As no
      consequence is to follow from their being seen by Emilia at this
      time, it is better, I think, to suppose, as Chaucer has done, that
      they are not seen by her.'--Tyrwhitt.

 [99] The same story has been imitated in the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, and
      in the Berceau of Lafontaine (Morley).

[100] I.e. Abington, seven miles to the S.E. of Cambridge, and nearly as
      far from Trumpington. In one way, it suits better; Trumpington is too
      near Cambridge for the clerks to have been benighted there.

[101] For an analysis of the Tale, see Morley, Eng. Writers, v. 321.

[102] _Se-ïnt_ seems to have been occasionally dissyllabic, as in Chaucer's
      Prologue, A 697.

[103] This may be true of some of the traditions embodied in the story; but
      as we have it, the date is much later.

[104] Or of the fourteenth century; they did not much vary.

[105] Reprinted in Chalmers' English Poets, i. 607 (1810).

[106] The objection is made that _all_ people 'speak in prose'; but I think
      Chaucer refers to something more rhetorical than ordinary
      conversation.

[107] All adapted from his early work, Of the Wretched Engendering of
      Mankinde; see p. 407. The four stanzas are: B 421-7, 771-7, 925-31,
      and 1135-41.

[108] Chaucer is, in fact, alluding to Trivet.

[109] In Anglia, xiv. 77-122, 147-185.

[110] I sometimes copy Mr. Brock's very words.

[111] The Dominican friars were also called _Friars Preachers_.

[112] Reprinted for the Early Eng. Text Soc., ed. S. J. Herrtage, 1879; see
      pp. 311, 493 of this edition.

[113] Warton gives the reference, viz. to his Speculum Historiale, lib.
      vii. c. 90, fol. 86 a.

[114] I.e. it is the sole authority for placing both the Shipman's Prologue
      and his Tale precisely here. At the same time, at least seventeen
      other MSS. make the Shipman's Prologue follow the Man of Law's Tale;
      only they turn it into a Prologue for the Sompnour or Squire.

[115] The Monk's cell is mentioned in the Prologue, l. 172; Chaucer's was
      his 'celle fantastyk'; Kn. Ta. 518 (A 1376).

[116] I put (_e_) not (_b_), in order to show the _chronological_ order,
      which is that of the letters, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_.

[117] The group (_f_) has nothing to do with (_e_); as will appear.

[118] I say 'recollections' advisedly; see note to B 3293. The mistake of
      confusing 'Busirus' with Diomedes, king of Thrace, suggests that
      Chaucer had not as yet written out his translation of Boethius, but
      had read it hastily. In other words, part of the Monkes Tale must be
      earlier than 1380.

[119] Printed 'Chauncer' in the old edition which I here follow.

[120] Ed. 1532, alther; Edd. 1550, 1561, _all ther_; Morris corrects to _a
      lither_.

[121] Compare C 1.

[122] C 164.

[123] C 165-170; 178-189.

[124] C 154.

[125] C 142.

[126] C. 192-9.

[127] C 203-206.

[128] C 254-276.

[129] A remarkable coincidence with the language of St. Paul in 1 Tim. vi.
      10.

[130] But this passage still more resembles Jerome against Jovinian; see
      note to the line.

[131] Cf. Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 292.

[132] I.e. the first edition of Gower's poem certainly preceded the Wife's
      Tale, though the second edition did not appear till 1393.

[133] Lat. 'nepos'; but later on, Claudius is called his _eme_, i.e. uncle.

[134] To which it is not unusual to object, by insisting that it was not
      Chaucer himself who met Petrarch, but the Clerk who tells the tale. I
      doubt if this amounts to more than a quibble. There is nothing out of
      place in Chaucer's reference to an incident in his own life, inasmuch
      as he was a clerk himself, in the sense of being a student.
      Otherwise, we have to explain how the poor clerk raised the money to
      pay for this long journey; how it came to pass that _he_ met
      Petrarch, and _when_; and how he acquired a copy of Petrarch's tale.

[135] See E 27, 40.

[136] See E 1147--'Petrark _wryteth_.' And yet Warton could imagine that
      Chaucer did not use a copy of Petrarch's version, but only wrote from
      recollection of what he had heard! If we enquire, how did Chaucer
      obtain this version, no answer is so likely as the supposition that
      Petrarch gave it him at parting. It is difficult to see how he could
      have got it otherwise.

[137] The words 'He is _now_ deed,' in E 29, suggest that Petrarch was
      still living when Chaucer first wrote the Tale.

       'There was also Grisildis innocence,
        And al hir mekenes and hir pacience.'
                   Lydgate, Temple of Glas, ed. Schick, l. 75.

[139] It occurs also in the black-letter editions, and in MSS. Harl. 1758
      and 7333, Barlow 20, and Royal 18 C. ii; as well as in E., Hn., Cm.,
      and Dd. Several MSS. follow it up by various scraps, taken from E.
      2419-40 and F 1-8, with the false substitution of _Sire Frankeleyn_
      for _Squier_ in F 1, which makes the line too long. See Part I of the
      Six-text edition, pp. xvii*-xx*.

[140] Chaucer und Albertanus Brixiensis; in Archiv für das Studium der
      neueren Sprachen; vol. 86, p. 29.

[141] To which are appended fables by Avian (leaf 106); by Alfonce (leaf
      120, back); and by Poge the Florentyn (leaf 134).

[142] The 'reasons' are not recondite; for fifteen MSS., at the least, have
      this arrangement.

[143] Tyrwhitt is quite right; he is alluding to the true Shipman's
      Prologue; B 1163-90.

[144] Only a few hours after writing this sentence, I found that Mr.
      Keightley, in his Tales and Popular Fictions, published in 1834, at
      p. 76, distinctly derives Chaucer's Tale from the travels of Marco
      Polo. I let the sentence stand, however, as an example of undesigned
      coincidence.

[145] So in Mr. Hazlitt's edition; Warton originally wrote--'to believe
      this story to be one of the many fables which the Arabians imported
      into Europe.'

[146] 'All things can be known by Perspective, because all operations of
      things take place according to the multiplication of forms and
      forces, by means of this world's agents, upon yielding
      materials.'--Opus Minus (see Warton).

[147] 'That sword, wrought with such art, that it cuts through enchantment
      and every charm.' I correct the errors in these quotations.

[148] 'Enchantment avails not, where it inflicts a cut.'

[149] 'O splendid falsehood, when is truth so beautiful that one can prefer
      her to thee?' In Warton's book, the Italian quotations abound in
      misprints, not all of which are removed in Hazlitt's edition. I
      cannot construe '_al_ vero,' as there printed.

[150] I would ask the reader to observe that the seven best MSS. all have
      the spelling _Cambynskan_ or _Kambynskan_. The form _Cambuscan_ (in
      Milton, Il Pens. 110) is found in the old black-letter editions. It
      is strange that Milton should accent the wrong syllable. _Cambynskan_
      arose from reading _Camiuscan_ as _Caminskan_.

[151] I find that Mr. Keightley has already suggested this.

[152] Evidently Shangtu, Coleridge's Xanadu. See his well-known lines--'In
      Xanadu did Kubla Khan,' &c.

[153] This is Chaucer's 'Sarra'; see note to F 9.

[154] Mr. Keightley shews, in his Tales and Popular Fictions, p. 75, that
      Cervantes has confused two stories, (1) that of a prince carrying off
      a princess on a wooden horse; and (2) that of Peter of Provence
      running away with the fair Magalona.

[155] See Arber's reprint, p. 85, where 'the hors of tree' [i.e. wood],
      ridden by 'Cleomedes the kynges sone,' is expressly mentioned, and is
      said to be 'torned' by 'a pynne that stode on his brest.'

[156] This magic ring is likewise referred to in chap. 32 of Caxton's
      Reynard the Fox. It had 'thre hebrews names therin,' and it contained
      'a stone of thre maner colours.' The same chapter mentions the magic
      mirror.

[157] A friend of Milton's father; see Masson, Life of Milton, i. 42.

[158] Printed at Brussels, 1865; ed. A. van Hasselt.

[159] I take the liberty of abridging the story by omitting several
      details.

[160] It had previously appeared in the fifth book of his Philocopo, a
      juvenile work.

[161] But Dr. Köppel argues that the date must be several years later. See
      his article in Anglia, xiv. 227; and observe Chaucer's use of Dante,
      Par. xxxiii. 1-21, in ll. 36-56, which may, however, be due to the
      insertion of ll. 36-56 at a later time. His argument that the Lyf of
      Seint Cecyle was written _after_ Troilus, because it contains neither
      _forthy_ nor _forwhy_, seems to me entirely valueless. The whole Tale
      only contains 553 lines, whereas we find in Troilus 777 consecutive
      lines in which neither word occurs, viz. in V. 351-1127.

[162] In l. 32, we have 'Thou comfort of us wrecches,' and in l. 58, 'Me
      flemed wrecche.' I suspect that these lines were, in the original
      draught, not far apart. l. 57 would follow l. 35 very suitably.

[163] Compare the section in the Acta Sanctorum, April 14, p. 209, headed:
      'Nova corporum inventio sub Clemente VIII, A.D. MDXCIX.'

[164] See my note to l. 134 of the Tale.

[165] Tyrwhitt further explains that a poem in Ashmole's volume, called
      Hermes Bird, and by him attributed to Raymund Lully, is really a poem
      of Lydgate's, printed by Caxton with the title The Chorle and the
      Bird.

[166] It is a totally different work from the Latin collection of
      alchemical works, also called Theatrum Chemicum, so often cited in my
      notes.

[167] At p. 470, Ashmole gives a brief account of Chaucer, made up from
      Speght, Bale, Pits, and others, of no particular value. At p. 226, he
      gives an engraving of the marble monument erected to Chaucer's memory
      in Westminster Abbey, by Nicholas Brigham, A.D. 1556.

[168] This is somewhat amusing. Charnock describes his numerous
      misadventures, and it is not clear that he preserved his faith in
      alchemy unshaken.

[169] Thomson's Hist. Chemistry, i. 25.

[170] '_Sir To._ What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus? _Sir
      And._ Taurus! that's sides and heart. _Sir To._ No, sir; it's legs
      and thighs.' Both are wrong, of course, as Shakespeare knew. Chaucer
      says--'Aries hath thin heved [head], and Taurus _thy nekke and thy
      throte_;' Astrolabe, pt. i. sec. 21. l. 52.

[171] See Browning's drama entitled 'Paracelsus.'

[172] It is useless to try and discover an etymology for this word. It was
      invented wittingly. The most that can be said was that Van Helmont
      may have been thinking of the Dutch _geest_, a spirit; E. _ghost_.

[173] This seems to us a strange selection; red, green, and violet would
      have been better. But this scale of colours is due to Aristotle, De
      Sensu, ii.; cf. Bartholomeus, De Proprietatibus Rerum, bk. xix. c. 7.

[174] The Indian god Siva, was actually worshipped _under the form of
      quicksilver_. Professor Cowell refers me to Marco Polo, ed. Yule, ii.
      300, and to his own edition of Colebrooke's Essays, i. 433; also to
      the semi-mythic life of Sankara Áchárya, the great reformer of the
      eighth century.

[175] This explains why the alchemists, in seeking gold, sometimes supposed
      that they had obtained silver.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
§ 1. DATE OF THE WORK.

In my introductory remarks to the Legend of Good Women, I refer to the
close connection that is easily seen to subsist between Chaucer's
translation of Boethius and his Troilus and Criseyde. All critics seem now
to agree in placing these two works in close conjunction, and in making the
prose work somewhat the earlier of the two; though it is not at all
unlikely that, for a short time, both works were in hand together. It is
also clear that they were completed before the author commenced the House
of Fame, the date of which is, almost certainly, about 1383-4. Dr. Koch, in
his Essay on the Chronology of Chaucer's Writings, proposes to date
'Boethius' about 1377-8, and 'Troilus' about 1380-1. It is sufficient to be
able to infer, as we can with tolerable certainty, that these two works
belong to the period between 1377 and 1383. And we may also feel sure that
the well-known lines to Adam, beginning--

 'Adam scriveyn, if ever it thee befalle
  _Boece_ or _Troilus_ to wryten newe'--

were composed at the time when the fair copy of Troilus had just been
finished, and may be dated, without fear of mistake, in 1381-3. It is not
likely that we shall be able to determine these dates within closer limits;
nor is it at all necessary that we should be able to do so. A few further
remarks upon this subject are given below.

§ 2. BOETHIUS.

Before proceeding to remark upon Chaucer's translation of Boethius, or (as
he calls him) Boece, it is necessary to say a few words as to the original
work, and its author.

Anicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boethius, the most learned philosopher
of his time, was born at Rome about A. D. 480, and was put to death A. D.
524. In his youth, he had the advantage of a liberal training, and enjoyed
the rare privilege of being able to read the Greek philosophers in their
own tongue. In the particular treatise which here most concerns us, his
Greek quotations are mostly taken from Plato, and there are a few
references to Aristotle, Homer, and to the _Andromache_ of Euripides. His
extant works shew that he was well acquainted with geometry, mechanics,
astronomy, and music, as well as with logic and theology; and it is an
interesting fact that an illustration of the way in which waves of sound
are propagated through the air, introduced by Chaucer into his House of
Fame, ll. 788-822, is almost certainly derived from the treatise of
Boethius _De Musica_, as pointed out in the note upon that passage. At any
rate, there is an unequivocal reference to 'the felinge' of Boece 'in
musik' in the Nonnes Preestes Tale, B 4484.

§ 3. The most important part of his political life was passed in the
service of the celebrated Theodoric the Goth, who, after the defeat and
death of Odoacer, A. D. 493, had made himself undisputed master of Italy,
and had fixed the seat of his government in Ravenna. The usual account,
that Boethius was twice married, is now discredited, there being no clear
evidence with respect to Elpis, the name assigned to his supposed first
wife; but it is certain that he married Rusticiana, the daughter of the
patrician Symmachus, a man of great influence and probity, and much
respected, who had been consul under Odoacer in 485. Boethius had the
singular felicity of seeing his two sons, Boethius and Symmachus, raised to
the consular dignity on the same day, in 522. After many years spent in
indefatigable study and great public usefulness, he fell under the
suspicion of Theodoric; and, notwithstanding an indignant denial of his
supposed crimes, was hurried away to Pavia, where he was imprisoned in a
tower, and denied the means of justifying his conduct. The rest must be
told in the eloquent words of Gibbon[1].

'While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the sentence
or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the "Consolation
of Philosophy"; a golden volume, not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or
Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times
and the situation of the author. The celestial guide[2], whom he had so
long invoked at Rome and at Athens, now condescended to illumine his
dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her salutary
balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity and his recent
distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy of fortune[3].
Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her gifts;
experience had satisfied him of their real value[4]; he had enjoyed them
without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the
impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had
left him virtue[5]. From the earth, Boethius ascended to heaven in search
of the SUPREME GOOD[6], explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance and
destiny[7], of prescience and freewill, of time and eternity, and
generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of the Deity with
the apparent disorders of his moral and physical government[8]. Such topics
of consolation, so obvious, so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to
subdue the feelings of human nature. Yet the sense of misfortune may be
diverted by the labour of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine,
in the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence,
must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he affected to
seek. Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length determined by the
ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate
of Theodoric. A strong cord was fastened round the head of Boethius, and
forcibly tightened till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and
some mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him with
clubs till he expired. But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of
knowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings of the
philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the English Kings, and
the third emperor of the name of Otho removed to a more honourable tomb the
bones of a catholic saint, who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired
the honours of martyrdom and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of
Boethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his two sons, of his
wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of
Symmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to
lament, he might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was
dragged in chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of
Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged
senator.'

This deed of injustice brought small profit to its perpetrator; for we read
that Theodoric's own death took place shortly afterwards; and that, on his
death-bed, 'he expressed in broken murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his
deep repentance for the murders of Boethius and Symmachus.'

§ 4. For further details, I beg leave to refer the reader to the essay on
'Boethius' by H. F. Stewart, published by W. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh
and London, in 1891. We are chiefly concerned here with the 'Consolation of
Philosophy,' a work which enjoyed great popularity in the middle ages, and
first influenced Chaucer indirectly, through the use of it made by Jean de
Meun in the poem entitled Le Roman de la Rose, as well as directly, at a
later period, through his own translation of it. Indeed, I have little
doubt that Chaucer's attention was drawn to it when, somewhat early in
life, he first perused with diligence that remarkable poem; and that it was
from the following passage that he probably drew the inference that it
might be well for him to translate the whole work:--

 'Ce puet l'en bien des clers enquerre
  Qui _Boëce de Confort_ lisent,
  Et les sentences qui là gisent,
  _Dont grans biens as gens laiz feroit
  Qui bien le lor translateroit_' (ll. 5052-6).

I.e. in modern English:--'This can be easily ascertained from the learned
men who read Boece on the Consolation of Philosophy, and the opinions which
are found therein; as to which, any one _who would well translate it for
them_ would confer much benefit on the unlearned folk':--a pretty strong
hint[9]!

§ 5. The chief events in the life of Boethius which are referred to in the
present treatise are duly pointed out in the notes; and it may be well to
bear in mind that, as to some of these, nothing further is known beyond
what the author himself tells us. Most of the personal references occur in
Book i. Prose 4, Book ii. Prose 3, and in Book iii. Prose 4. In the first
of these passages, Boethius recalls the manner in which he withstood one
Conigastus, because he oppressed the poor (l. 40); and how he defeated the
iniquities of Triguilla, 'provost' (_præpositus_) of the royal household
(l. 43). He takes credit for defending the people of Campania against a
particularly obnoxious fiscal measure instituted by Theodoric, which was
called 'coemption' (_coemptio_); (l. 59.) This Mr. Stewart describes as 'a
fiscal measure which allowed the state to buy provisions for the army at
something under market-price--which threatened to ruin the province.' He
tells us that he rescued Decius Paulinus, who had been consul in 498, from
the rapacity of the officers of the royal palace (l. 68); and that, in
order to save Decius Albinus, who had been consul in 493, from wrongful
punishment, he ran the risk of incurring the hate of the informer Cyprian
(l. 75). In these ways, he had rendered himself odious to the court-party,
whom he had declined to bribe (l. 79). His accusers were Basilius, who had
been expelled from the king's service, and was impelled to accuse him by
pressure of debt (l. 81); and Opilio and Gaudentius, who had been sentenced
to exile by royal decree for their numberless frauds and crimes, but had
escaped the sentence by taking sanctuary. 'And when,' as he tells us, 'the
king discovered this evasion, he gave orders that, unless they quitted
Ravenna by a given day, they should be branded on the forehead with a hot
iron and driven out of the city. Nevertheless on that very day the
information laid against me by these men was admitted' (ll. 89-94). He next
alludes to some forged letters (l. 123), by means of which he had been
accused of 'hoping for the freedom of Rome,' (which was of course
interpreted to mean that he wished to deliver Rome from the tyranny of
Theodoric). He then boldly declares that if he had had the opportunity of
confronting his accusers, he would have answered in the words of Canius,
when accused by Caligula of having been privy to a conspiracy against
him--'If I had known it, thou shouldst never have known it' (ll. 126-135).
This, by the way, was rather an imprudent expression, and probably told
against him when his case was considered by Theodoric.

He further refers to an incident that took place at Verona (l. 153), when
the king, eager for a general slaughter of his enemies, endeavoured to
extend to the whole body of the senate the charge of treason, of which
Albinus had been accused; on which occasion, at great personal risk,
Boethius had defended the senate against so sweeping an accusation.

In Book ii. Prose 3, he refers to his former state of happiness and good
fortune (l. 26), when he was blessed with rich and influential
parents-in-law, with a beloved wife, and with two noble sons; in particular
(l. 35), he speaks with justifiable pride of the day when his sons were
both elected consuls together, and when, sitting in the Circus between
them, he won general praise for his wit and eloquence.

In Book iii. Prose 4, he declaims against Decoratus, with whom he refused
to be associated in office, on account of his infamous character.

§ 6. The chief source of further information about these circumstances is a
collection of letters (Variæ Epistolæ) by Cassiodorus, a statesman who
enjoyed the full confidence of Theodoric, and collected various
state-papers under his direction. These tell us, in some measure, what can
be said on the other side. Here Cyprian and his brother Opilio are spoken
of with respect and honour; and the only Decoratus whose name appears is
spoken of as a young man of great promise, who had won the king's sincere
esteem. But when all has been said, the reader will most likely be inclined
to think that, in cases of conflicting evidence, he would rather take the
word of the noble Boethius than that of any of his opponents.

§ 7. The treatise 'De Consolatione Philosophiæ' is written in the form of a
discourse between himself and the personification of Philosophy, who
appears to him in his prison, and endeavours to soothe and console him in
his time of trial. It is divided (as in this volume) into five Books; and
each Book is subdivided into chapters, entitled Metres and Proses, because,
in the original, the alternate chapters are written in a metrical form, the
metres employed being of various kinds. Thus Metre 1 of Book I is written
in alternate hexameters and pentameters; while Metre 7 consists of very
short lines, each consisting of a single dactyl and spondee. The Proses
contain the main arguments; the Metres serve for embellishment and
recreation.

In some MSS. of Chaucer's translation, a few words of the original are
quoted at the beginning of each Prose and Metre, and are duly printed in
this edition, in a corrected form.

§ 8. A very brief sketch of the general contents of the volume may be of
some service.

  BOOK I. Boethius deplores his misfortunes (met. 1). Philosophy appears to
  him in a female form (pr. 2), and condoles with him in song (met. 2);
  after which she addresses him, telling him that she is willing to share
  his misfortunes (pr. 3). Boethius pours out his complaints, and
  vindicates his past conduct (pr. 4). Philosophy reminds him that he seeks
  a heavenly country (pr. 5). The world is not governed by chance (pr. 6).
  The book concludes with a lay of hope (met. 7).

  BOOK II. Philosophy enlarges on the wiles of Fortune (pr. 1), and
  addresses him in Fortune's name, asserting that her mutability is natural
  and to be expected (pr. 2). Adversity is transient (pr. 3), and Boethius
  has still much to be thankful for (pr. 4). Riches only bring anxieties,
  and cannot confer happiness (pr. 5); they were unknown in the Golden Age
  (met. 5). Neither does happiness consist in honours and power (pr. 6).
  The power of Nero only taught him cruelty (met. 6). Fame is but vanity
  (pr. 7), and is ended by death (met. 7). Adversity is beneficial (pr. 8).
  All things are bound together by the chain of Love (met. 8).

  BOOK III. Boethius begins to receive comfort (pr. 1). Philosophy
  discourses on the search for the Supreme Good (_summum bonum_; pr. 2).
  The laws of nature are immutable (met. 2). All men are engaged in the
  pursuit of happiness (pr. 3). Dignities properly appertain to virtue (pr.
  4). Power cannot drive away care (pr. 5). Glory is deceptive, and the
  only true nobility is that of character (pr. 6). Happiness does not
  consist in corporeal pleasures (pr. 7); nor in bodily strength or beauty
  (pr. 8). Worldly bliss is insufficient and false; and in seeking true
  felicity, we must invoke God's aid (pr. 9). Boethius sings a hymn to the
  Creator (met. 9); and acknowledges that God alone is the Supreme Good (p.
  10). The unity of soul and body is necessary to existence, and the love
  of life is instinctive (pr. 11). Error is dispersed by the light of Truth
  (met. 11). God governs the world, and is all-sufficient, whilst evil has
  no true existence (pr. 12). The book ends with the story of Orpheus (met.
  12).

  BOOK IV. This book opens with a discussion of the existence of evil, and
  the system of rewards and punishments (pr. 1). Boethius describes the
  flight of Imagination through the planetary spheres till it reaches
  heaven itself (met. 1). The good are strong, but the wicked are
  powerless, having no real existence (pr. 2). Tyrants are chastised by
  their own passions (met. 2). Virtue secures reward; but the wicked lose
  even their human nature, and become as mere beasts (pr. 3). Consider the
  enchantments of Circe, though these merely affected the outward form
  (met. 4). The wicked are thrice wretched; they _will_ to do evil, they
  _can_ do evil, and they actually _do_ it. Virtue is its own reward; so
  that the wicked should excite our pity (pr. 4). Here follows a poem on
  the folly of war (met. 4). Boethius inquires why the good suffer (pr. 5).
  Philosophy reminds him that the motions of the stars are inexplicable to
  one who does not understand astronomy (met. 5). She explains the
  difference between Providence and Destiny (pr. 6). In all nature we see
  concord, due to controlling Love (met. 6). All fortune is good; for
  punishment is beneficial (pr. 7). The labours of Hercules afford us an
  example of endurance (met. 7).

  BOOK V. Boethius asks questions concerning Chance (pr. 1). An example
  from the courses of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates (met. 1). Boethius
  asks questions concerning Free-will (pr. 2). God, who sees all things, is
  the true Sun (met. 2). Boethius is puzzled by the consideration of God's
  Predestination and man's Free-will (pr. 3). Men are too eager to inquire
  into the unknown (met. 3). Philosophy replies to Boethius on the subjects
  of Predestination, Necessity, and the nature of true Knowledge (pr. 4);
  on the impressions received by the mind (met. 4); and on the powers of
  Sense and Imagination (pr. 5). Beasts look downward to the earth, but man
  is upright, and looks up to heaven (met. 5). This world is not eternal,
  but only God is such; whose prescience is not subject to necessity, nor
  altered by human intentions. He upholds the good, and condemns the
  wicked; therefore be constant in eschewing vice, and devote all thy
  powers to the love of virtue (pr. 6).

§ 9. It is unnecessary to enlarge here upon the importance of this
treatise, and its influence upon medieval literature. Mr. Stewart, in the
work already referred to, has an excellent chapter 'On Some Ancient
Translations' of it. The number of translations that still exist, in
various languages, sufficiently testify to its extraordinary popularity in
the middle ages. Copies of it are found, for example, in Old High German by
Notker, and in later German by Peter of Kastl; in Anglo-French by Simun de
Fraisne; in continental French by Jean de Meun[10], Pierre de Paris, Jehan
de Cis, Frere Renaut de Louhans, and by two anonymous authors; in Italian,
by Alberto della Piagentina and several others; in Greek, by Maximus
Planudes; and in Spanish, by Fra Antonio Ginebreda; besides various
versions in later times. But the most interesting, to us, are those in
English, which are somewhat numerous, and are worthy of some special
notice. I shall here dismiss, as improbable and unnecessary, a suggestion
sometimes made, that Chaucer may have consulted some French version in the
hope of obtaining assistance from it; there is no sure trace of anything of
the kind, and the internal evidence is, in my opinion, decisively against
it.

§ 10. The earliest English translation is that by king Ælfred, which is
particularly interesting from the fact that the royal author frequently
deviates from his original, and introduces various notes, explanations, and
allusions of his own. The opening chapter, for example, is really a
preface, giving a brief account of Theodoric and of the circumstances which
led to the imprisonment of Boethius. This work exists only in two MSS.,
neither being of early date, viz. MS. Cotton, Otho A VI, and MS. Bodley NE.
C. 3. 11. It has been thrice edited; by Rawlinson, in 1698; by J. S.
Cardale, in 1829; and by S. Fox, in 1864. The last of these includes a
modern English translation, and forms one of the volumes of Bohn's
Antiquarian Library; so that it is a cheap and accessible work. Moreover,
it contains an alliterative verse translation of most of the _Metres_
contained in Boethius (excluding the _Proses_), which is also attributed to
Ælfred in a brief metrical preface; but whether this ascription is to be
relied upon, or not, is a difficult question, which has hardly as yet been
decided. A summary of the arguments, for and against Ælfred's authorship,
will be found in Wülker's _Grundriss zur Geschichte der angelsächsischen
Litteratur_, pp. 421-435.

§ 11. I may here mention that there is a manuscript copy of this work by
Boethius, in the original Latin, in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, No.
214, which contains a considerable number of Anglo-Saxon glosses. A
description of this MS., by Prof. J. W. Bright and myself, is printed in
the American Journal of Philology, vol. v, no. 4.

§ 12. The next English translation, in point of date, is Chaucer's;
concerning which I have more to say below.

§ 13. In the year 1410, we meet with a _verse_ translation of the whole
treatise, ascribed by Warton (Hist. E. Poetry, § 20, ed. 1871, iii. 39) to
John Walton, Capellanus, or John the Chaplain, a canon of Oseney. 'In the
British Museum,' says Warton, 'there is a correct MS. on parchment[11] of
Walton's translation of Boethius; and the margin is filled throughout with
the Latin text, written by Chaundler above mentioned [i. e. Thomas
Chaundler, among other preferments dean of the king's chapel and of
Hereford Cathedral, chancellor of Wells, and successively warden of
Wykeham's two colleges at Winchester and Oxford.] There is another less
elegant MS. in the same collection[12]. But at the end is this
note:--'Explicit liber Boecij de Consolatione Philosophie de Latino in
Anglicum translatus A.D. 1410, per Capellanum Ioannem. This is the
beginning of the prologue:--"In suffisaunce of cunnyng and witte[13]." And
of the translation:--"Alas, I wrecch, that whilom was in welth." I have
seen a third copy in the library of Lincoln cathedral[14], and a fourth in
Baliol college[15]. This is the translation of Boethius printed in the
monastery of Tavistock in 1525[16], and in octave stanzas. This translation
was made at the request of Elizabeth Berkeley.'

Todd, in his Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer, p. xxxi, mentions another
MS. 'in the possession of Mr. G. Nicol, his Majesty's bookseller,' in which
the above translation is differently attributed in the colophon, which ends
thus: 'translatus anno d_omi_ni millesimo ccccx^o. per Capellanum Iohannem
Tebaud, alius Watyrbeche.' This can hardly be correct[17].

I may here note that this verse translation has _two_ separate Prologues.
One Prologue gives a short account of Boethius and his times, and is extant
in MS. Gg. iv. 18 in the Cambridge University Library. An extract from the
other is quoted below. MS. E Museo 53, in the Bodleian Library, contains
both of them.

§ 14. As to the work itself, Metre 1 of Book i. and Metre 5 of the same are
printed entire in Wülker's Altenglisches Lesebuch, ii. 56-9. In one of the
metrical prologues to the whole work the following passage occurs, which I
copy from MS. Royal 18 A xiii:--

 'I have herd spek and sumwhat haue y-seyne,
  Of diuerse men[18], that wounder subtyllye,
  In metir sum, and sum in prosë pleyne,
  This book translated haue[19] suffishantlye
  In-to[20] Englissh tongë, word for word, wel nye[21];
  Bot I most vse the wittes that I haue;
  Thogh I may noght do so, yit noght-for-thye,
  With helpe of god, the sentence schall I saue.

  To Chaucer, that is floure of rethoryk
  In Englisshe tong, and excellent poete,
  This wot I wel, no-thing may I do lyk,
  Thogh so that I of makynge entyrmete:
  And Gower, that so craftily doth trete,
  As in his book, of moralitee,
  Thogh I to theym in makyng am vnmete,
  [Gh]it most I schewe it forth, that is in me.'

This is an early tribute to the excellence of Chaucer and Gower as poets.

§ 15. When we examine Walton's translation a little more closely, it soon
becomes apparent that he has largely availed himself of Chaucer's prose
translation, which he evidently kept before him as a model of language. For
example, in Bk. ii. met. 5, l. 16, Chaucer has the expression:--'tho weren
the cruel clariouns ful hust and ful stille.' This reappears in one of
Walton's lines in the form:--'Tho was ful huscht the cruel clarioun.' This
is poetry made easy, no doubt.

In order to exhibit this a little more fully, I here transcribe the whole
of Walton's translation of this metre, which may be compared with Chaucer's
rendering at pp. 40, 41 below. I print in italics all the words which are
common to the two versions, so as to shew this curious result, viz. that
Walton was here more indebted to Chaucer, than Chaucer, when writing his
poem of 'The Former Age,' was to himself. The MS. followed is the Royal MS.
mentioned above (p. xvi).

  BOETHIUS: BOOK II: METER V.

  A VERSE TRANSLATION BY JOHN WALTON.

  Full wonder _blisseful was_ that rather _age_,
  When mortal men couthe _holde hem_-selven[22]  _payed_

§ 16. MS. Auct. F. 3. 5, in the Bodleian Library, contains a _prose_
translation, different from Chaucer's. After this, the next translation
seems to be one by George Colvile; the title is thus given by Lowndes:
'Boetius de Consolatione Philosophiæ, translated by George Coluile, alias
Coldewel. London: by John Cawoode; 1556. 4to.' This work was dedicated to
Queen Mary, and reprinted in 1561; and again, without date.

There is an unprinted translation, in hexameters and other metres, in the
British Museum (MS. Addit. 11401), by Bracegirdle, temp. Elizabeth. See
Warton, ed. Hazlitt, iii. 39, note 6.

Lowndes next mentions a translation by J. T., printed at London in 1609,
12mo.

A translation 'Anglo-Latine expressus per S. E. M.' was printed at London
in quarto, in 1654, according to Hazlitt's Hand-book to Popular Literature.

Next, a translation into English verse by H. Conningesbye, in 1664, 12mo.

The next is thus described: 'Of the Consolation of Philosophy, made English
and illustrated with Notes by the Right Hon. Richard (Graham) Lord Viscount
Preston. London; 1695, 8vo. Second edition, corrected; London; 1712, 8vo.'

A translation by W. Causton was printed in London in 1730; 8vo.

A translation by the Rev. Philip Ridpath, printed in London in 1785, 8vo.,
is described by Lowndes as 'an excellent translation with very useful
notes, and a life of Boethius, drawn up with great accuracy and fidelity.'

A translation by R. Duncan was printed at Edinburgh in 1789, 8vo.; and an
anonymous translation, described by Lowndes as 'a pitiful performance,' was
printed in London in 1792, 8vo.

In a list of works which the Early English Text Society proposes shortly to
print, we are told that 'Miss Pemberton has sent to press her edition of
the fragments of Queen Elizabeth's Englishings (in the Record Office) from
Boethius, Plutarch, &c.'

§ 17. I now return to the consideration of Chaucer's translation, as
printed in the present volume.

I do not think the question as to the probable date of its composition need
detain us long. It is so obviously connected with 'Troilus' and the 'House
of Fame,' which it probably did not long precede, that we can hardly be
wrong in dating it, as said above, about 1377-1380; or, in round numbers,
about 1380 or a little earlier. I quite agree with Mr. Stewart (Essay, p.
226), that, 'it is surely most reasonable to connect its composition with
those poems which contain the greatest number of recollections and
imitations of his original;' and I see no reason for ascribing it, with
Professor Morley (English Writers, v. 144), to Chaucer's youth. Even Mr.
Stewart is so incautious as to suggest that Chaucer's 'acquaintance with
the works of the Roman philosopher ... would seem to date from about the
year 1369, when he wrote the Deth of Blaunche.' When we ask for some
tangible evidence of this statement, we are simply referred to the
following passages in that poem, viz. the mention of 'Tityus (588); of
Fortune the debonaire (623); Fortune the monster (627); Fortune's
capriciousness and her rolling wheel (634, 642); Tantalus (708); the mind
compared to a clean parchment (778); and Alcibiades (1055-6);' see Essay,
p. 267. In every one of these instances, I believe the inference to be
fallacious, and that Chaucer got all these illustrations, _at second hand_,
from Le Roman de la Rose. As a matter of fact, they are all to be found
there; and I find, on reference, that I have, in most instances, already
given the parallel passages in my notes. However, to make the matter
clearer, I repeat them here.

Book Duch. 588. Cf. Comment li juisier _Ticius_
                    S'efforcent ostoir de mangier;
                         Rom. Rose, 19506.
                    Si cum tu fez, las _Sisifus_, &c.;
                         R. R. 19499.

Book Duch. 623. The dispitouse debonaire,
                That scorneth many a creature.

I cannot give the exact reference, because Jean de Meun's description of
the various moods of Fortune extends to a portentous length. Chaucer
reproduces the general impression which a perusal of the poem leaves on the
mind. However, take ll. 4860-62 of Le Roman:--

  Que miex vaut asses et profite
  Fortune _perverse et contraire_
  Que la mole et _la debonnaire_.

Surely 'debonaire' in Chaucer is rather French than Latin. And see
_debonaire_ in the E. version of the Romaunt, l. 5412.

Book Duch. 627. She is the monstres heed y-wryen,
                As _filth over y-strawed with floures_.

                Si di, par ma parole ovrir,
                Qui vodroit _un femier covrir_
                De dras de soie ou _de floretes_; R. R. 8995.

As the second of the above lines from the Book of the Duchesse is obviously
taken from _Le Roman_, it is probable that the first is also; but it is a
hard task to discover the particular word _monstre_ in this vast poem.
However, I find it, in l. 4917, with reference to Fortune; and her _wheel_
is not far off, six lines above.

B. D. 634, 642. Fortune's capriciousness is treated of by Jean de Meun at
intolerable length, ll. 4863-8492; and elsewhere. As to her wheel, it is
continually rolling through his verses; see ll. 4911, 5366, 5870, 5925,
6172, 6434, 6648, 6880, &c.

B. D. 708. Cf. Et de fain avec _Tentalus_; R. R. 19482.

B. D. 778. Not from Le Roman, nor from Boethius, but from Machault's
_Remède de Fortune_, as pointed out by M. Sandras long ago; see my note.

B. D. 1055-6. Cf. Car le cors Alcipiades
                  Qui de biauté avoit adés ...
                  _Ainsinc le raconte Boece_; R. R. 8981.

See my note on the line; and note the spelling of _Alcipiades_ with a _p_,
as in the English MSS.

We thus see that all these passages (except l. 778) are really taken from
Le Roman, not to mention many more, already pointed out by Dr. Köppel
(_Anglia_, xiv. 238). And, this being so, we may safely conclude that they
were _not_ taken from Boethius directly. Hence we may further infer that,
in all probability, Chaucer, in 1369, was not very familiar with Boethius
in the Latin original. And this accounts at once for the fact that he
seldom quotes Boethius at first hand, perhaps not at all, in any of his
earlier poems, such as the Complaint unto Pite, the Complaint of Mars, or
Anelida and Arcite, or the Lyf of St. Cecilie. I see no reason for
supposing that he had closely studied Boethius before (let us say) 1375;
though it is extremely probable, as was said above, that Jean de Meun
inspired him with the idea of reading it, to see whether it was really
worth translating, as the French poet said it was.

§ 18. When we come to consider the style and manner in which Chaucer has
executed his self-imposed task, we must first of all make some allowance
for the difference between the scholarship of his age and of our own. One
great difference is obvious, though constantly lost sight of, viz. that the
teaching in those days was almost entirely oral, and that the student had
to depend upon his memory to an extent which would now be regarded by many
as extremely inconvenient. Suppose that, in reading Boethius, Chaucer comes
across the phrase 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum' (Bk. iii. pr.
12, note to l. 55), and does not remember the sense of _clauus_; what is to
be done? It is quite certain, though this again is frequently lost sight
of, that he had no access to a convenient and well-arranged Latin
Dictionary, but only to such imperfect glossaries as were then in use.
Almost the only resource, unless he had at hand a friend more learned than
himself, was to guess. He guesses accordingly; and, taking _clauus_ to mean
much the same thing as _clauis_, puts down in his translation: 'and he is
as a _keye_ and a stere.' Some mistakes of this character were almost
inevitable; and it must not greatly surprise us to be told, that the
'inaccuracy and infelicity' of Chaucer's translation 'is not that of an
inexperienced Latin scholar, but rather of one who was no Latin scholar at
all,' as Mr. Stewart says in his Essay, p. 226. It is useful to bear this
in mind, because a similar lack of accuracy is characteristic of Chaucer's
other works also; and we must not always infer that emendation is
necessary, when we find in his text some curious error.

§ 19. The next passage in Mr. Stewart's Essay so well expresses the state
of the case, that I do not hesitate to quote it at length. 'Given (he says)
a man who is sufficiently conversant with a language to read it fluently
without paying too much heed to the precise value of participle and
preposition, who has the wit and the sagacity to grasp the meaning of his
author, but not the intimate knowledge of his style and manner necessary to
a right appreciation of either, and--especially if he set himself to write
in an uncongenial and unfamiliar form--he will assuredly produce just such
a result as Chaucer has done.

'We must now glance (he adds) at the literary style of the translation. As
Ten Brink has observed, we can here see as clearly as in any work of the
middle ages what a high cultivation is requisite for the production of a
good prose. Verse, and not prose, is the natural vehicle for the expression
of every language in its infancy, and it is certainly not in prose that
Chaucer's genius shews to best advantage. The restrictions of metre were
indeed to him as silken fetters, while the freedom of prose only served to
embarrass him; just as a bird that has been born and bred in captivity,
whose traditions are all domestic, finds itself at a sad loss when it
escapes from its cage and has to fall back on its own resources for
sustenance. In reading "Boece," we have often as it were to pause and look
on while Chaucer has a desperate wrestle with a tough sentence; but though
now he may appear to be down, with a victorious knee upon him, next moment
he is on his feet again, disclaiming defeat in a gloss which makes us doubt
whether his adversary had so much the best of it after all. But such
strenuous endeavour, even when it is crowned with success, is strange in a
writer one of whose chief charms is the delightful ease, the complete
absence of effort, with which he says his best things. It is only necessary
to compare the passages in Boethius in the prose version with the same when
they reappear in the poems, to realise how much better they look in their
verse dress. Let the reader take Troilus' soliloquy on Freewill and
Predestination (Bk. iv. ll. 958-1078), and read it side by side with the
corresponding passage in "Boece" (Bk. v. proses 2 and 3), and he cannot
fail to feel the superiority of the former to the latter. With what
clearness and precision does the argument unfold itself, how close is the
reasoning, how vigorous and yet graceful is the language! It is to be
regretted that Chaucer did not do for all the Metra of the "Consolation"
what he did for the fifth of the second book. A solitary gem like "The
Former Age" makes us long for a whole set[32]. Sometimes, whether
unconsciously or of set purpose, it is difficult to decide, his prose slips
into verse:--

  It lyketh me to shewe, by subtil song,
  With slakke and délitáble soun of strenges (Bk. iii. met. 2. 1).

  Whan Fortune, with a proud right hand (Bk. ii. met. 1. 1)[33].'

The reader should also consult Ten Brink's History of English Literature,
Book iv. sect. 7. I here give a useful extract.

'This version is complete, and faithful in all essential points. Chaucer
had no other purpose than to disclose, if possible wholly, the meaning of
this famous work to his contemporaries; and notwithstanding many errors in
single points, he has fairly well succeeded in reproducing the sense of the
original. He often employs for this purpose periphrastic turns, and for the
explanation of difficult passages, poetical figures, mythological and
historical allusions; and he even incorporates a number of notes in his
text. His version thus becomes somewhat diffuse, and, in the undeveloped
state of prose composition so characteristic of that age, often quite
unwieldy. But there is no lack of warmth, and even of a certain
colouring....

'The language of the translation shews many a peculiarity; viz. numerous
Latinisms, and even Roman idioms in synthesis, inflexion, or syntax, which
are either wholly absent or at least found very rarely in Chaucer's poems.
The labour of this translation proved a school for the poet, from which his
powers of speech came forth not only more elevated but more self-reliant;
and above all, with a greater aptitude to express thoughts of a deeper
nature.'

§ 20. Most of the instances in which Chaucer's rendering is inaccurate,
unhappy, or insufficient are pointed out in the notes. I here collect some
examples, many of which have already been remarked upon by Dr. Morris and
Mr. Stewart.

iii. pr. 9. 16. Wenest thou that he, that hath nede of power, that him ne
lakketh no-thing? 'An tu arbitraris quod nihilo indigeat egere potentia?'
On this Mr. Stewart remarks that 'it is easy to see that _indigeat_ and
_egere_ have changed places.' To me, it is not quite easy; for the senses
of the M.E. _nede_ and _lakken_ are very slippery. Suppose we make them
change places, and read:--'Wenest thou that he, that hath lak of power,
that him ne nedeth no-thing?' This may be better, but it is not wholly
satisfactory.

iii. pr.9. 39-41. that he ... yif him nedeth = whether he needeth. A very
clumsy passage; see the Latin quoted in the note.

v. pr. 4. 56. right as we trowen: 'quasi uero credamus.'

v. met. 5. 6. by moist fleeinge: 'liquido uolatu.'

§ 21. In the case of a few supposed errors, as pointed out by Mr. Stewart,
there remains something to be said on the other side. I note the following
instances.

i. pr. 6. 28. Lat. 'uelut hiante ualli robore.' Here Mr. Stewart quotes the
reading of MS. A., viz. 'so as the strengthe of the paleys schynyng is
open.' But the English text in that MS. is corrupt. The correct reading is
'palis chyning;' where _palis_ means _palisade_, and translates _ualli_;
and _chyning is open_ means _is gaping open_, and translates _hiante_.

ii. pr. 5. 16. Lat. 'largiendi usu.' The translation has: 'by usage of
large yevinge _of him that hath yeven it_.' I fail to see much amiss; for
the usual sense of _large_ in M. E. is _liberal_, _bounteous_, _lavish_. Of
course we must not substitute the modern sense without justification.

ii. pr. 5. 35. 'of the laste beautee' translates Lat. 'postremae
pulcritudinis.' For this, see my note on p. 431.

ii. pr. 7. 38. Lat. 'tum commercii insolentia.' Chaucer has: 'what for
defaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of marchaundise.' There is not much
amiss; but MS. A. omits the word _and_ after _unusage_, which of course
makes nonsense of the passage.

ii. met. 8. 6. Lat. 'Ut fluctus auidum mare Certo fine coerceat.' Chaucer
has: 'that the see, greedy to flowen, constreyned with a certein ende hise
floodes.' Mr. Stewart understands 'greedy to flowen' to refer to 'fluctus
auidum.' It seems to me that this was merely Chaucer's first idea of the
passage, and that he afterwards meant 'hise floodes' to translate
'fluctus,' but forgot to strike out 'to flowen.' I do not defend the
translation.

iii. pr. 11. 86. Lat. 'sede;' Eng. 'sete.' This is quite right. Mr. Stewart
quotes the Eng. version as having 'feete,' but this is only a corrupt
reading, though found in the best MS. Any one who is acquainted with M. E.
MSS. will easily guess that 'feete' is merely mis-copied from 'seete,' with
a long _s_; and, indeed, _sete_ is the reading of the black-letter
editions. There is a blunder here, certainly; only it is not the author's,
but due to the scribes.

iv. pr. 6. 176. Lat. 'quidam me quoque excellentior:' Eng. 'a philosophre,
the more excellent by me.' The M. E. use of _by_ is ambiguous; it
frequently means 'in comparison with.'

v. met. 5. 14. Lat. 'male dissipis:' Eng. 'wexest yvel out of thy wit.' In
this case, _wexest out of thy wit_ translates _dissipis_; and _yvel_, which
is here an adverb, translates _male_.

Of course we must also make allowances for the variations in Chaucer's
Latin MS. from the usually received text. Here we are much assisted by MS.
C., which, as explained below, appears to contain a copy of the very text
which he consulted, and helps to settle several doubtful points. To take
two examples. In Book ii. met. 5. 17, Chaucer has 'ne hadde nat deyed yit
_armures_,' where the usual Lat. text has 'tinxerat _arua_.' But many MSS.
have _arma_; and, of these, MS. C. is one.

Once more, in Book ii. met. 2. 11, Chaucer has 'sheweth _other_ gapinges,'
where the usual Lat. text has '_Altos_ pandit hiatus.' But some MSS. have
_Alios_; and, of these, MS. C. is one.

§ 22. After all, the chief point of interest about Chaucer's translation of
Boethius is the influence that this labour exercised upon his later work,
owing to the close familiarity with the text which he thus acquired. I have
shewn that we must not expect to find such influence upon his earliest
writings; and that, in the case of the Book of the Duchesse, it affected
him at second hand, through Jean de Meun. But in other poems, viz. Troilus,
the House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, some of the Balades, and in
the Canterbury Tales, the influence of Boethius is frequently observable;
and we may usually suppose such influence to have been direct and
immediate; nevertheless, we should always keep an eye on Le Roman de la
Rose, for Jean de Meun was, in like manner, influenced in no slight degree
by the same work. I have often taken an opportunity of pointing out, in my
Notes to Chaucer, passages of this character; and I find that Mr. Stewart,
with praiseworthy diligence, has endeavoured to give (in Appendix B,
following his Essay, at p. 260) 'An Index of Passages in Chaucer which seem
to have been suggested by the De Consolatione Philosophiae.' Very useful,
in connection with this subject, is the list of passages in which Chaucer
seems to have been indebted to Le Roman de la Rose, as given by Dr. E.
Köppel in _Anglia_, vol. xiv. 238-265. Another most useful help is the
comparison between Troilus and Boccaccio's _Filostrato_, by Mr. W. M.
Rossetti; which sometimes proves, beyond all doubt, that a passage which
may seem to be due to Boethius, is really taken from the Italian poet. As
this seems to be the right place for exhibiting the results thus obtained,
I proceed to give them, and gladly express my thanks to the above-named
authors for the opportunity thus afforded.

(This case is doubtful. Chaucer's phrase--_men seyn_--shews that he is
quoting a common proverb. 'Ase fele thedes, as fele thewes, quoth Hendyng.'
'Tant de gens, tant de guises.'--Ray. So many countries, so many
customs.--Hazlitt).

526. O god, that at thy disposicioun

TROILUS: BOOK IV.

*1-7. (Fortune's changes, her wheel, and her scorn).--B. ii. pr. 1. 12;
met. 1. 1, 5-10; pr. ii. 37. (But note, that ll. 1-3 are really due to the
_Filostrato_, Bk. iii. st. 94; and ll. 6, 7 are copied from _Le Roman de la
Rose_, 8076-9).

200. cloud of errour.--B. iii. met. 11. 7.

391. Ne trust no wight to finden in Fortune
     Ay propretee; hir yeftes ben comune.
                              B. ii. pr. 2. 7-9; 61-2.

*481-2. (Repeated from Book III. 1625-8. But, this time, it is copied from
the _Filostrato_, Bk. iv. st. 56).

503. For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne,
     That, oft y-cleped, comth and endeth peyne.

      The ende of blisse ay sorwe it occupyeth.
                              B. ii. pr. 4. 90.

(A very doubtful instance; for l. 836 is precisely the same as Prov. xiv.
13. The word _occupyeth_ is decisive; see my note to Cant. Ta. B 421).

958; 963-6. (Predestination).--B. v. pr. 2. 30-34.

974-1078. (Necessity and Free Will).--B. v. pr. 3. 7-19; 21-71.

*1587.               ... thenk that lord is he

                              B. ii. pr. 4. 98-101.

(But note that l. 1589 really translates two lines in the _Filostrato_, Bk.
iv. st. 154).


TROILUS: BOOK V.

278. And Phebus with his rosy carte.--B. ii. met. 3. 1, 2.

763. Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.--B. iii. pr. 2. 6-8.

         Through purveyaunce and disposicioun
         Of heighe Iove.        B. iv. pr. 6. 75-77.

*1809. (The allusion here to the 'seventh spere' has but a remote reference
to Boethius (iv. met. 1. 16-19); for this stanza 259 is translated from
Boccaccio's _Teseide_, Bk. xi. st. 1).

It thus appears that, for this poem, Chaucer made use of B. i. met. 1, pr.
2, met. 3, pr. 4, met. 5; ii. pr. 1, met. 1, pr. 2, pr. 3, met. 3, pr. 4,

v. pr. 2, pr. 3.


THE HOUSE OF FAME.

*535 (Book ii. 27). Foudre. (This allusion to the thunderbolt is copied
from Machault, as shewn in my note; but Machault probably took it from
Boeth. i. met. 4. 8; and it is curious that Chaucer has _tour_, not
_toun_).

730-746 (Book ii. 222-238).--Compare B. iii. pr. 11; esp. 98-111. (Also Le
Roman de la Rose, 16957-69; Dante, _Purg._ xviii. 28).

972-8 (Book ii. 464-70).--B. iv. met. 1. 1-5.

1368-1375 (Book iii. 278-285).--Compare B. i. pr. 1. 8-12.

*1545-8 (Book iii. 455-8).--Compare B. i. pr. 5. 43, 44. (The likeness is
very slight).

1920 (Book iii. 830). An hous, that _domus Dedali_, That _Laborintus_
cleped is.--B. iii. pr. 12. 118.


LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.

195 (p. 78). tonne.--B. ii. pr. 2. 53-5.

*2228-30. (_Philomela_, 1-3).--B. iii. met. 9. 8-10. (Doubtful; for the
same is in _Le Roman de la Rose_, 16931-6, which is taken from Boethius.
And Köppel remarks that the word _Eternally_ answers to nothing in the
Latin text, whilst it corresponds to the French _Tous jors en
pardurableté_).

GROUP E.

THE CLERKES TALE. Mr. Stewart refers ll. 810-2 to Boethius, but these lines
translate Petrarch's sentence--'Nulla homini perpetua sors est.' Also ll.
1155-1158, 1161; but these lines translate Petrarch's sentence--'Probat
tamen et sæpe nos, multis ac _grauibus flagellis exerceri sinit_, non ut
animum nostrum sciat, quem sciuit antequam crearemur ... abundè ergo
constantibus uiris ascripserim, quisquis is fuerit, qui pro Deo suo sine
murmure patiatur.' I find no hint that Chaucer was directly influenced by
Boethius, while writing this Tale.

THE MARCHANTES TALE. Mr. Stewart refers ll. 1311-4 to Boethius, but they
are more likely from Albertanus Brixiensis, _Liber de Amore dei_, fol. 30 a
(as shewn by Dr. Köppel):--'Et merito uxor est diligenda, qui donum est

GROUP G.

THE SECONDE NONNES TALE. I think it certain that this early Tale is quite
independent of Boethius. L. 114, instanced by Mr. Stewart, is from
'Ysidorus'; see my note.

and mark it as such.)

472. Som-tyme the delyces of a man is cause of the grevous maladye thurgh
which he dyeth.--B. iii. pr. 7. 3-5.

§ 24. It is worth while to see what light is thrown upon the chronology of
the Canterbury Tales by comparison with Boethius.

In the first place, we may remark that, of the Tales mentioned above, there
is nothing to shew that The Seconde Nonnes Tale, the Clerkes Tale, or even
the Tale of Melibeus, really refer to any passages in Boethius. They may,
in fact, have been written _before_ that translation was made. In the
instance of the Second Nonnes Tale, this was certainly the case; and it is
not unlikely that the same is true with respect to the others.

But the following Tales (_as revised_) seem to be later than 'Boece,' viz.
The Knightes Tale, The Man of Lawes Tale, and The Monkes Tale; whilst it is
quite certain that the following Tales were amongst the latest written,
viz. the Nonne Preestes Tale, the three tales in Group D (Wyf, Frere,
Somnour), the Marchantes Tale, the Squieres Tale, the Frankeleins Tale, the
Canouns Yemannes Tale, and the Maunciples Tale; all of which are in the
heroic couplet, and later than 1385.

The case of the Knightes Tale is especially interesting; for the numerous
references in it to Boece, and the verbal resemblances between it and
Troilus shew that _either_ the original _Palamoun and Arcite_ was written
just after those works, _or else_ (which is more likely) it was revised,
and became the Knight's Tale, nearly at that time. The connection between
Palamon and Arcite, Anelida, and the Parlement of Foules, and the
introduction of three stanzas from the Teseide near the end of Troilus,
render the former supposition unlikely; whilst at the same time we are
confirmed in the impression that the (revised) Knightes Tale succeeded
Boece and Troilus at no long interval, and was, in fact, the _first_ of the
Canterbury Tales that was written _expressly for the purpose_ of being
inserted in that collection, viz. about 1385-6.


§ 25. THE MANUSCRIPTS.

I have now to explain the sources of the present edition.

1. MS. C. = MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 21. This MS., in the Cambridge University
Library, is certainly the best; and has therefore been taken as the basis
of the text. The English portion of it was printed by Dr. Furnivall for the
Chaucer Society in 1886; and I have usually relied upon this very useful
edition[40]. It is a fine folio MS., wholly occupied with Boethius (_De
Consolatione Philosophiae_), and comments upon it.

It is divided into two distinct parts, which have been bound up together.
The latter portion consists of a lengthy commentary upon Boethius, at the
end of which we find the title, viz.--'Exposicio preclara quam Iohannes
Theutonicus prescripsit et finiuit Anno d_omi_ni M^oCCCvj viij ydus Iunii;'
i.e. An Excellent Commentary, written by Johannes Teutonicus, and finished
June 6, 1306. This vast commentary occupies 118 folios, in double columns.

The former part of the volume concerns us more nearly. I take it to be, for
all practical purposes, _the authentic copy_. For it presents the following
peculiarities. It contains the whole of the Latin text, as well as
Chaucer's English version; and it is surprising to find that these are
written in alternate chapters. Thus the volume begins with the Latin text
of Metre 1, at the close of which there follows immediately, on the same
page, Chaucer's translation of Metre 1. Next comes Prose 1 in Latin,
followed by Prose 1 in English; and so throughout.

Again, if we examine the Latin text, there seems reason to suppose that it
fairly represents the very recension which Chaucer used. It abounds with
side-notes and glosses, all in Latin; and the glosses correspond to those
in Chaucer's version. Thus, to take an example, the following lines occur
near the end of Bk. iii. met. 11:--

 'Nam cur rogati sponte recte[41] censetis
  Ni mersus alto uiueret fomes corde.'

Over _rogati_ is written the gloss _i. interrogato_.

Over _censetis_ is written _i. iudicatis_.

Over _Ni_ is _i. nisi_; over _mersus alto_ is _i. latenter conditos_; over
_uiueret_ is _i. vigeret_; and over _fomes_ is _i. radix veritatis_.

Besides these glosses, there is here the following side-note:--'Nisi radix
veritatis latenter conditus vigeret in abscondito mentis, homo non
iudicaret recta quacunque ordinata interrogata.'

When we turn to Chaucer's version, we find that he first gives a
translation of the two verses, thus:--

'For wherefor elles demen ye of your owne wil the rightes, whan ye ben
axed, but-yif so were that the norisshinge of resoun ne livede y-plounged
in the depthe of your herte?'

After this he adds, by way of comment:--'This is to seyn, how sholden men
demen the sooth of anything that were axed, yif ther nere a rote of
soothfastnesse that were y-plounged and hid in naturel principles, the
whiche soothfastnesse lived with-in the deepnesse of the thought.'

It is obvious that he has here reproduced the general sense of the Latin
side-note above quoted. The chief thing which is missing in the Latin is
the expression 'in naturel principles.' But we have only to look to a
passage a little higher up, and we find the line--

 'Suis retrusum possidere thesauris.'

Over the word _retrusum_ is written _i. absconditum_; and over _thesauris_
is _i. naturalibus policiis et principiis naturaliter inditis_. Out of
these we have only to pick the words _absconditum naturalibus ...
principiis_, and we at once obtain the missing phrase--'hid in naturel
principles.'

Or, to take another striking example. Bk. iv. met. 7 begins, in the MS.,
with the lines:

 'Bella bis quinis operatus annis
  Vltor attrides frigie ruinis,
  Fratris amissos thalamos piauit.'

At the beginning, just above these, is written a note: 'Istud metrum est de
tribus exemplis: de agamenone (_sic_); secundum de vlixe; tertium, de
hercule.'

The glosses are these; over _quinis_ is _i. decim_; over _attrides_ is
_agamenon_ (_sic_); over _Fratris_ is _s. menelai_; and over _piauit_ is
_i. vlcissendo_ (_sic_) _purgauit: troia enim erat metropolis Frigie_.

If we turn to Chaucer's version, in which I print the additions to the text
in italics, we find that it runs thus:--

'The wreker Attrides, _that is to seyn, Agamenon_, that wroughte and
continuede the batailes by ten yeer, recovered and purgede _in wrekinge_,
by the destruccioun of Troye, the loste chaumbres of mariage of his
brother; _this is to seyn, that he, Agamenon, wan ayein Eleyne, that was
Menelaus wyf his brother_.'

We see how this was made up. Not a little curious are the spellings
_Attrides_ and _Agamenon_[42], as occurring both in the Latin part of this
MS. and in Chaucer's version. Again, Chaucer has _ten_, corresponding to
the gloss _decim_, not to the textual phrase _bis quinis_. His explanation
of _piauit_ by _recovered and purgede in wrekinge_ is clearly due to the
gloss _ulciscendo purgauit_. His substitution of _Troye_ for _Frigie_ is
due to the gloss: _troia enim erat metropolis Frigie_. And even the name
_Menelaus his brother_ answers to _Fratris, s. menelai_. And all that is
left, as being absolutely his own, are the words _and continuede_,
_recovered_, and _wan ayein Eleyne_. We soon discover that, in a hundred
instances, he renders a single Latin verb or substantive by two English
verbs or substantives, by way of making the sense clearer; which accounts
for his introduction of the verbs _continuede_ and _recovered_; and this
consideration reduces Chaucer's additional contribution to a mention of the
name of _Eleyne_, which was of course extremely familiar to him.

Similarly, we find in this MS. the original of the gloss explaining
_coempcioun_ (p. 11); of the 'Glose' on p. 15; of the 'Glosa' on p. 26; and
of most of the notes which, at first sight, look like additions by Chaucer
himself[43].

The result is that, in all difficulties, the first authority to be
consulted is the Latin text in this particular MS.; for we are easily led
to conclude that it was intentionally designed to preserve both Chaucer's
translation and the original text. It does not follow that it is always
perfect; for it can only be a _copy_ of the Latin, and the scribe may err.
In writing _recte_ for _recta_ (see note on p. xxxviii), he has certainly
committed an error by a slip of the pen. The same mistake has been observed
to occur in another MS., viz. Codex Gothanus I.

The only drawback is this. The MS. is so crowded with glosses and
side-notes, many of them closely written in small characters, that it is
almost impossible to consult them all. I have therefore contented myself
with resorting to them for information in difficult passages only. For
further remarks on this subject, I must refer the reader to the Notes.

Lastly, I may observe that the design of preserving in this MS. all the
apparatus referring to Chaucer's Boethius, is made the more apparent by the
curious fact that, _in this MS. only_, the two poems by Chaucer that are
closely related to Boethius, viz. The Former Age, and Fortune, are actually
inserted into the very body of it, immediately after Bk. ii. met. 5. This
place was of course chosen because The Former Age is, to some extent, a
verse translation of that metre; and Fortune was added because, being
founded upon scraps from several chapters, it had no definite claim to any
specific place of its own.

In this MS., the English text, like the Latin one, has a few imperfections.
One imperfection appears in certain peculiarities of spelling. The scribe
seems to have had some habits of pronunciation that betoken a greater
familiarity with Anglo-French than with English. The awkward position of
the guttural sound of _gh_ in _neighebour_ seems to have been too much for
him; hence he substituted _ssh_ (= _sh-sh_) for _gh_, and gives us the
spelling _neysshebour_ (Bk. ii. pr. 3. 24, foot-note; pr. 7. 57,
foot-note.) Nevertheless, it is the best MS. and has most authority. For
further remarks, see the account of the present edition, on pp.
xlvi-xlviii.

2. MS. Camb. Ii. 1. 38. This MS. also belongs to the Cambridge University
Library, and was written early in the fifteenth century. It contains 8
complete quires of 8 leaves, and 1 incomplete quire of 6 leaves, making 70
leaves in all. The English version appears alone, and occupies 68 leaves,
and part of leaf 69 recto; leaf 69, verso, and leaf 70, are blank. The last
words are:--'þe eyen of þe Iuge þat seeth and demeth alle thinges.
_Explicit liber boecij, &c._' Other treatises, in Latin, are bound up with
it, but are unrelated. The readings of this MS. agree very closely with
those of Ii. 3. 21, and of our text. Thus, in Met. i. l. 9, it has the
reading _wyerdes_, with the gloss _s. fata_, as in Ii. 3. 21. (The scribe
at first wrote _wyerldes_, but the _l_ is marked for expunction.) In l. 12,
it has _emptid_, whereas the Addit. MS. has _emty_; and in l. 16 it has
_nayteth_, whereas the Addit. MS. wrongly has _naieth_. On account of its
close agreement with the text, I have made but little use of it.

It is worth notice that this MS. (like Harl. 2421) frequently has correct
readings in cases where even the MS. above described exhibits some blunder.
A few such instances are given in the notes. For example, it has the
reading _wrythith_ in Bk. i. met. 4. 7, where MS. C. has the absurd word
_writith_, and MS. A. has _wircheth_. In the very next line, it has
_thonder-leit_, and it is highly probable that _leit_ is the real word, and
_light_ an ignorant substitution; for _leit_ (answering to A.S. _l[=e]get_,
_l[=i]get_) is the right M.E. word for 'lightning'; see the examples in
Stratmann. So again, in Bk. ii. met. 3. 13, it reads _ouer-whelueth_, like
the black-letter editions; whilst MS. C. turns _whelueth_ into _welueeth_,
and MS. A. gives the spelling _whelweth_. In Bk. ii. pr. 6. 63, it
correctly retains _I_ after _may_, though MSS. C. and A. both omit it. In
Bk. ii. pr. 8. 17, it has _wyndy_, not _wyndynge_; and I shew (in the note
at p. 434) that _windy_ is, after all, the correct reading, since the Lat.
text has _uentosam_. In Bk. iii. met. 3. 1, it resembles the printed
editions in the insertion of the words _or a goter_ after _river_. In Bk.
iv. pr. 3. 47, 48, it preserves the missing words: _peyne, he ne douteth
nat þat he nys entecchid and defouled with_. In Bk. iv. met. 6. 24, it has
the right reading, viz. _brethith_. Finally, it usually retains the word
_whylom_ in places where the MS. next described substitutes the word
_somtyme_. If any difficulty in the text raises future discussion, it is
clear that this MS. should be consulted.

3. MS. A. = MS. Addit. 10340, in the British Museum. This is the MS.
printed at length by Dr. Morris for the Early English Text Society, and
denoted by the letter 'A.' in my foot-notes. As it is so accessible, I need
say but little. It is less correct than MS. Ii. 3. 21 in many readings, and
the spelling, on the whole, is not so good. The omissions in it are also
more numerous, but it occasionally preserves a passage which the Cambridge
MS. omits. It is also imperfect, as it omits Prose 8 and Metre 8 of Bk.
ii., and Prose 1 of Bk. iii. It has been collated throughout, though I have
usually refrained from quoting such readings from it as are evidently
inferior or wrong. I notice one peculiarity in particular, viz. that it
almost invariably substitutes the word _somtyme_ for the _whylom_ found in
other copies; and _whylom_, in this treatise, is a rather common word. Dr.
Morris's account of the MS. is here copied.

'The Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the
force of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong verbs,
which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak verbs where
it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles of weak verbs, where
it is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is careful to preserve
the final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the definite declension of the
adjective; (2) of the plural adjective; (3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of
the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of present participles; (6) of the 2nd
pers. pret. indic. of strong verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older
vowel-ending.

'The Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural) and _-nes_ (in
_wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb. MS. has _thilke_ (as usual in the
Canterbury Tales) and _-nesse_.'

The copy of Boethius is contained on foll. 3-40. On fol. 41, recto, is a
copy of Chaucer's _Truth_, and the description of the 'Persone,' extracted
from the Prologue to the Cant. Tales. The other side of the leaf is blank.
This is, in fact, the MS. which I denote by 'At.,' as described in the
Introduction to the 'Minor Poems' in vol. i. p. 57.

4. MS. Addit. 16165, in the British Museum. This is one of Shirley's MSS.,
being that which I denote by 'Ad.,' and have described in the Introduction
to the 'Minor Poems' in vol. i. p. 56. I believe this MS. to be of less
value than MS. A. (above), and have therefore not collated it; for even A.
is not a very good authority.

5. MS. Harl. 2421. The Harleian Catalogue describes it thus: 'Torq. Sever.
Boetius: his 5 Books of the Comfort of Philosophy. Translated into English.
On vellum, 152 leaves. XV century.'

A small quarto MS. of the middle of the fifteenth century. The first Prose
of Bk. i. begins (like MS. A.) with the words: 'In þe mene while þat y stil
recorded þese þinges;' &c. Hence are derived the readings marked 'H.' in
Morris's edition, pp. 62-64. It rightly reads _writheth_, _wyndy_,
_bretheth_ (see p. xlii).

6. The celebrated Hengwrt MS. of the Canterbury Tales (denoted by 'Hn.' in
the foot-notes to that poem) contains a part of Chaucer's Boethius. See the
Second Report of the Historical MSS. Commission, p. 106.

7. There is also a copy in a MS. belonging to the Cathedral Library at
Salisbury. It was discovered by Dr. Wülker in 1875; see the _Academy_ for
Oct. 5, 1875. Bk. i. met. 1 was printed, from this MS., by Dr. Wülker in
_Anglia_, ii. 373. It resembles MS. A.

8. In the Phillipps collection, MS. no. 9472 is described as 'Boetius' Boke
of Comfort,' and is said to be of the fifteenth century. I do not know its
real contents.


§ 26. THE PRINTED EDITIONS.

CAXTON. Chaucer's Boethius was first printed by Caxton, without date; but
probably before 1479. See the description in The Biography and Typography
of W. Caxton, by W. Blades; second edition, 1882; p. 213. A complete
collation of this text with MS. A., as printed by Morris, was printed by L.
Kellner, of Vienna, in Englische Studien, vol. xiv, pp. 1-53; of which I
have gladly availed myself. The text agrees very closely indeed with that
printed by Thynne in 1532, and resembles MS. C. rather than MS. A.

Perhaps it is necessary to remark that the readings of MS. C., as given in
Kellner's collation, are sometimes incorrect, because MS. C. had not at
that time been printed, and the readings of that MS. were only known to him
from the foot-notes in Morris's edition, which are not exhaustive, but only
record the more important variations. There is a curious but natural error,
for example, in his note on l. 1002 of Morris's edition (Bk. ii. met. 3.
14, p. 32, l. 1), where MS. C. has _[gh]eelde_ (= _zeelde_). The word is
missing in MS. A., but Morris supplied it from C. to complete the text.
Hence the foot-note has: '[_[gh]eelde_]--from C.'; meaning that A. omits
_[gh]eelde_, which is supplied from C. This Kellner took to mean that A.
has _[gh]eelde_, and C. has _from_. However, the readings of A. and of
Caxton are given with all possible care and minuteness; and now that C. is
also in type, the slight inevitable errors are easily put right. This
excellent piece of work has saved me much trouble.

It turns out that Caxton's text is of great value. He followed a MS. (now
lost) which is, in some places, even more correct than MS. C. The following
readings are of great importance, as they correct MSS. C. and A. (I denote
Caxton's edition by the symbol Cx.)

Bk. i. met. 4. 7. Cx. writheth. (Cf. p. xlii. above, l. 6.)

Bk. i. met. 4. 8. Cx. thonder leyte[44].

Bk. i. met. 5. 26. Cx. punisheth.

Bk. i. met. 5. 28. Cx. on the nekkes.

Bk. i. pr. 6. 54. Cx. funden (_but read_ founden).

Bk. i. pr. 6. 65. Cx. norissing. (Perhaps better than _norisshinges_, as in
the MSS.; for the Lat. text has the sing. _fomitem_.) Cf. Bk. iii. met. 11.
27.

Bk. ii. pr. 3. 59. Cx. seeld (_better_ selde). It is clear that _yelde_ in
MS. A. arose from a reading _[gh]elde_, which really meant _zelde_, the
Southern form of _selde_. See below.

Bk. ii. met. 3. 14. Cx. selde (_correctly_). And so again in Bk. ii. pr. 6.
15.

Bk. ii. pr. 6. 63. Cx. may I most. (MSS. C. A. _omit_ I.)

Bk. ii. pr. 8. 17. Cx. wyndy (which is right; see note, p. 434).

Bk. iii. pr. 1. 26. Cx. thyne (_better_ thyn, _as in_ Thynne).

Bk. iii. pr. 10. 10. Cx. denyed (_or read_ deneyed).

Bk. iii. pr. 10. 51. Cx. that the fader. (MSS. that this prince.) Caxton's
translation is closer; Lat. text, _patrem_.

Bk. iii. pr. 11. 116. Cx. slepen.

Bk. iii. pr. 11. 152. Cx. maistow (Thynne _has_ mayst thou) MS. C. _omits_
thou; and MS. A. is defective.

Bk. iii. pr. 12. 143. Cx. Parmenides.

Bk. iv. pr. 6. 52. Cx. be cleped.

Bk. iv. pr. 6. 188, 189. Cx. and some dispyse that they mowe not here
(_misprint for_ bere). MSS. C. and A. omit this clause.

Bk. v. pr. 1. 9, 10. Cx. assoilen to the the dette (where the former _the_
= thee).

Bk. v. pr. 3. 142. Cx. impetren.

In a few places, Caxton's text is somewhat fuller than that of the MSS.
Thus in Bk. ii. pr. 3. 8, Cx. has: thei ben herd _and sowne in eeres_ thei,
&c. However, the Lat. text has merely: 'cum audiuntur.' And again, only 9
lines lower (l. 17), Cx. inserts _and ajuste_ after _moeve_; but the Lat.
text has merely: 'admouebo.' In some cases, it is closer to the Latin text;
as, e. g. in Bk. i. met. 3. 9, where Cx. has _kaue_ (Lat. _antro_), whereas
MSS. C. and A. have the pl. _kaues_. In Bk. i. pr. 3. 41, where C. has the
E. form _Sorans_, Cx. preserves the Latin form _Soranos_.

It thus appears that a collation with Caxton's text is of considerable
service.

THYNNE. Thynne's edition of Chaucer, printed in 1532, contains Boethius. I
suspect that Thynne simply reprinted Caxton's text, without consulting any
other authority; for it is hard to detect any difference, except that his
spellings are somewhat less archaic. Hence this text, by a lucky accident,
is an extremely good one, and I have constantly referred to it in all cases
of difficulty. Readings from this edition are marked in the foot-notes with
the symbol 'Ed.'

The later black-letter copies are mere reprints of Thynne's text, each
being, as usual, a little worse than its predecessor, owing to the
introduction of misprints and later forms. I have consulted the editions of
1550 (undated) and 1561. Perhaps the most readable edition is that by
Chalmers, in vol. i. of his British Poets, as it is in Roman type. It
closely resembles the edition of 1561, and is therefore not very correct.


§ 27. THE PRESENT EDITION.

The present edition is, practically, the first in which the preparation of
the text has received adequate attention. Caxton's edition probably
represents a single MS., though a very good one; and all the black-letter
editions merely reproduce the same text, with various new errors. Dr.
Morris's edition was unfortunately founded on an inferior MS., as he
discovered before the printing of it was completed. Dr. Furnivall's text
reproduces the excellent MS. C., but collation was rightly refrained from,
as his object was to give the exact spellings of the MS. for the benefit of
students. Hence there are several passages, in both of these editions,
which do not afford the best sense; in a few places, they are less correct
than the black-letter editions. It is also a considerable drawback to the
reader, that they reproduce, of course intentionally and fully, the
troublesome and obscure punctuation-marks of the MSS.

Finding the ground thus clear, I have taken occasion to introduce the
following improvements. The text is founded on MS. C., certainly the best
extant authority, which it follows, on the whole, very closely. At the same
time, it has been carefully collated throughout with the text of MS. A.,
and (what is even more important) with the texts printed by Caxton and
Thynne and with the original Latin text (1) as given in the edition by
Obbarius (Jena 1843)[45] and (2) as existing in MS. C. The latter usually
gives the exact readings of the MS. used by Chaucer himself. By taking
these precautions, I have introduced a considerable number of necessary
corrections, so that we now possess a very close approximation to the
original text as it left Chaucer's hands. In all cases where emendations
are made, the various readings are given in the foot-notes, where 'C.' and
'A.' refer to the two chief MSS., and 'Ed.' refers to Thynne's first
edition (1532). But I have intentionally refrained from crowding these
foot-notes with inferior readings which are certainly false. Some readings
from the excellent MS. Ii. 1. 38 are given in the Notes; I now wish that I
had collated it throughout. I have introduced modern punctuation. As I am
here entirely responsible, the reader is at liberty to alter it, provided
that he is justified in so doing by the Latin text.

Wherever Chaucer has introduced explanatory words and phrases which are not
in the Latin text, I have printed them _in italics_; as in lines 6, 7, and
18 on page 1. However, these words and phrases are seldom original; they
are usually translated or adapted from some of the Latin glosses and notes
with which MS. C. abounds; as explained above, at p. xxxviii.

I have also adopted an entirely new system of numbering. In Dr. Morris's
edition, every line of the _printed_ text is numbered consecutively, from 1
up to 5219, which is the last line of the treatise. In Dr. Furnivall's
print of MS. C., a new numbering begins on every page, from 1 to 32, 33,
34, or 35. Both these methods are entirely useless for general reference.
The right method of reference is Tyrwhitt's, viz. to treat every chapter
separately. Thus a reference to 'Bk. 1. met. 2' serves for every edition;
but I have further taken occasion to number the lines of every chapter, for
greater convenience. Thus the word _acountinge_ occurs in Bk. i. met. 2.
10: and even in referring to a black-letter edition, the number 10 is of
some use, since it shews that the word occurs very nearly _in the middle_
of the Metre. The usual method of referring to editions _by the page_ is an
extremely poor and inconvenient makeshift; and it is really nearly time
that editors should learn this elementary lesson. Unfortunately, some
difficulty will always remain as to the numbering of the lines of _prose_
works, because the length of each line is indefinite. The longest chapter,
Bk. iv. pr. 6, here extends to 258 lines; the shortest, Bk. iii. met. 3,
has less than 7 lines.

I have also corrected the spelling of MS. C. in a large number of places,
but within very narrow limits. The use of the final _e_ in that MS. is
exceedingly correct, and has almost always been followed, except where
notice to the contrary is given in the notes. My corrections are chiefly
limited to the substitution of _in_ for _yn_, and of _i_ for short _y_, in
such words as _bygynnen_, for which I write _biginnen_; the substitution of
_y_ for long _i_, as in _whylom_, when the MS. has _whilom_; the use of _v_
for the MS. symbol _u_ (where necessary); the substitution of _sch_ or
_ssh_ for _ss_, when the sound intended is double _sh_; and the
substitution of _e_ and _o_ for _ee_ and _oo_ where the vowels are
obviously long by their position in the word. I also substitute _-eth_ and
_-ed_ for the variable _-eth_ or _-ith_, and _-ed_, _-id,_ or _-yd_ of the
MS. Such changes render the text more uniformly phonetic, and much more
readable, without really interfering with the evidence. Changes of a bolder
character are duly noted.

The introduction of these slight improvements will not really trouble the
reader. The trouble has been the editor's; for I found that the only
satisfactory way of producing a really good text was to rewrite the whole
of it. It seemed worth while to have a useful critical edition of
'Boethius' for general reference, because of the considerable use which
Chaucer himself made of his translation when writing many of his later
poems.

The Notes are all new, in the sense that no annotated edition of Chaucer's
text has hitherto appeared. But many of them are, necessarily, copied or
adapted from the notes to the Latin text in the editions by Vallinus and
Valpy.




INTRODUCTION TO TROILUS.


§ 1. DATE OF THE WORK. The probable date is about 1380-2, and can hardly
have been earlier than 1379 or later than 1383. No doubt it was in hand for
a considerable time. It certainly followed close upon the translation of
Boethius; see p. vii above.

§ 2. SOURCES OF THE WORK. The chief authority followed by Chaucer is
Boccaccio's poem named _Il Filostrato_, in 9 Parts or Books of very
variable length, and composed in ottava rima, or stanzas containing eight
lines each. I have used the copy in the Opere Volgari di G. Boccaccio;
Firenze, 1832.

Owing to the patient labours of Mr. W. M. Rossetti, who has collated the
_Filostrato_ with the _Troilus_ line by line, and published the results of
his work for the Chaucer Society in 1875, we are able to tell the precise
extent to which Chaucer is indebted to Boccaccio for this story. The
_Filostrato_ contains 5704 lines; and the _Troilus_ 8239 lines[46], if we
do not reckon in the 12 Latin lines printed below, at p. 404. Hence we
obtain the following result.

  Total of lines in _Troilus_       8239
  Adapted from the _Filostrato_
     (2730 lines, condensed into)   2583
                                    ----
         Balance due to Chaucer     5656

In other words, Chaucer's debt to Boccaccio amounts to _less than_
one-third of the whole poem; and there remains more than two-thirds of it
to be accounted for from other sources. But even after all deductions have
been made for passages borrowed from other authors, very nearly two-thirds
remain for which Chaucer is solely responsible. As in the case of the
Knightes Tale, close investigation shews that Chaucer is, after all, less
indebted to Boccaccio than might seem, upon a hasty comparison, to be the
case.

As it was found impracticable to give Mr. Rossetti's results in full, I
have drawn up lists of parallel passages in a somewhat rough way, which are
given in the Notes, at the beginning of every Book; see pp. 461, 467, 474,
484, 494. These lists are sufficiently accurate to enable the reader, in
general, to discover the passages which are in no way due to the
_Filostrato_.

§ 3. I have taken occasion, at the same time, to note _other_ passages for
which Chaucer is indebted to some other authors. Of these we may
particularly note the following. In Book I, lines 400-420 are translated
from Petrarch's 88th Sonnet, which is quoted at length at p. 464. In Book
III, lines 813-833, 1625-9, and 1744-1768 are all from the second Book of
Boethius (Prose 4, 86-120 and 4-10, and Metre 8). In Book IV, lines
974-1078 are from Boethius, Book V. In Book V, lines 1-14 and 1807-27 are
from various parts of Boccaccio's _Teseide_; and a part of the last stanza
is from Dante. On account of such borrowings, we may subtract about 220
lines more from Chaucer's 'balance'; which still leaves due to him nearly
5436 lines.

§ 4. Of course it will be readily understood that, in the case of these
5436 lines, numerous short quotations and allusions occur, most of which
are pointed out in the notes. Thus, in Book II, lines 402-3 are from Ovid,
Art. Amat. ii. 118; lines 716-8 are from Le Roman de la Rose[47]; and so
on. No particular notice need be taken of this, as similar hints are
utilised in other poems by Chaucer; and, indeed, by all other poets. But
there is one particular case of borrowing, of considerable importance,
which will be considered below, in § 9 (p. liii).

§ 5. It is, however, necessary to observe here that, in taking his story
from Boccaccio, Chaucer has so altered and adapted it as to make it
peculiarly his own; precisely as he has done in the case of the Knightes
Tale. Sometimes he translates very closely and even neatly, and sometimes
he takes a mere hint from a long passage. He expands or condenses his
material at pleasure; and even, in some cases, transposes the order of it.
It is quite clear that he gave himself a free hand.

The most important point is that he did not accept the characters of the
three chief actors, Troilus, Criseyde, and Pandarus, as pourtrayed by
Boccaccio; he did not even accept all the incidents which gave occasion for
their behaviour. Pandarus is no longer the cousin of Criseyde, a young and
dashing gallant, but her middle-aged uncle, with blunted perceptions of
what is moral and noble. In fact, Chaucer's Pandarus is a thorough and
perfect study of character, drawn with a dramatic skill not inferior to
that of Shakespeare, and worthy of the author of the immortal Prologue to
the Canterbury Tales. I must leave the fuller consideration of these points
to others; it is hardly necessary to repeat, at full length, the Prefatory
Remarks by Mr. Rossetti, whilst at the same time, if I begin to quote from
them, I shall hardly know where to stop. See also Ten Brink's English
Literature, and Morley's English Writers, vol. v.

§ 6. It has been observed that, whilst Chaucer carefully read and made very
good use of two of Boccaccio's works, viz. Il Filostrato and Il Teseide, he
nowhere mentions Boccaccio by name; and this has occasioned some surprise.
But we must not apply modern ideas to explain medieval facts, as is so
frequently done. When we consider how often MSS. of works by known authors
have no author's name attached to them, it becomes likely that Chaucer
obtained manuscript copies of these works unmarked by the author's name;
and though he must doubtless have been aware of it, there was no cogent
reason why he should declare himself indebted to one in whom Englishmen
were, as yet, quite uninterested. Even when he refers to Petrarch in the
Clerk's Prologue (E 27-35), he has to explain who he was, and to inform
readers of his recent death. In those days, there was much laxity in the
mode of citing authors.

§ 7. It will help us to understand matters more clearly, if we further
observe the haphazard manner in which quotations were often made. We know,
for example, that no book was more accessible than the Vulgate version of
the Bible; yet it is quite common to find the most curious mistakes made in
reference to it. The author of Piers Plowman (B. text, iii. 93-95)
attributes to Solomon a passage which he quotes from Job, and (B. vii. 123)
to St. Luke, a passage from St. Matthew; and again (B. vi. 240) to St.
Matthew, a passage from St. Luke. Chaucer makes many mistakes of a like
nature; I will only cite here his reference to Solomon (Cant. Tales, A
4330), as the author of a passage in Ecclesiasticus. Even in modern
dictionaries we find passages cited from 'Dryden' or 'Bacon' at large,
without further remark; as if the verification of a reference were of
slight consequence. This may help to explain to us the curious allusion to
_Zanzis_ as being the author of a passage which Chaucer must have known was
from his favourite Ovid (see note to Troil. iv. 414), whilst he was, at the
same time, well aware that Zanzis was not a poet, but a painter (Cant.
Tales, C 16); however, in this case we have probably to do with a piece of
our author's delicious banter, since he adds that Pandarus was speaking
'for the nonce.'

There is another point about medieval quotations which must by no means be
missed. They were frequently made, not from the authors themselves, but
from manuscript note-books which contained hundreds of choice passages,
from all sorts of authors, collected by diligent compilers. Thus it was, I
strongly suspect, that Albertano of Brescia was enabled to pour out such
quantities of quotations as those which Chaucer copied from him in his Tale
of Melibeus. Thus it was that borrowers of such note-books often trusted to
their strong memories for the words of a quotation, yet forgot or mistook
the author's name; as was readily done when a dozen such names occurred on
every page. A MS. of this character is before me now. It contains many
subjects in alphabetical order. Under _Fortitudo_ are given 17 quotations
which more or less relate to it, from Ambrose, Gregory, Chrysostom, and the
rest, all in less than a single page. And thus it was, without doubt, that
Chaucer made acquaintance with the three scraps of Horace which I shall
presently consider. It is obvious that Chaucer never saw Horace's works in
the complete state; if he had done so, he would have found a writer after
his own heart, and he would have quoted him even more freely than he has
quoted Ovid. 'Chaucer on Horace' would have been delightful indeed; but
this treat was denied, both to him and to us.

§ 8. The first and second scraps from Horace are hackneyed quotations.
'Multa renascentur' occurs in Troil. ii. 22 (see note, p. 468); and 'Humano
capiti' in Troil. ii. 1041 (note, p. 472). In the third case (p. 464),
there is no reason why we should hesitate to accept the theory, suggested
by Dr. G. Latham (_Athenæum_, Oct. 3, 1868) and by Professor Ten Brink
independently, that the well-known line (Epist. I, 2. 1)--

 'Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,'

was misunderstood by Chaucer (or by some one else who misled him) as
implying that Lollius was the name of a writer on the Trojan war. Those who
are best acquainted with the ways of medieval literature will least
hesitate to adopt this view. It is notorious that _first lines_ of a poem
are frequently quoted apart from their context, and repeated as if they
were complete; and, however amazing such a blunder may seem to us now,
there is really nothing very extraordinary about it.

We should also notice that Lollius was to Chaucer a mere name, which he
used, in his usual manner, as a sort of convenient embellishment; for he is
inconsistent in his use of it. In Book i. 394, 'myn autour called Lollius'
really means Petrarch; whereas in Book v. 1653, though the reference is to
the Filostrato, Bk. viii. st. 8, Chaucer probably meant no more than that
Lollius was an author whom the Italian poet might have followed[48]. Cf. my
note to the House of Fame, 1468, where the name occurs for the third time.
We may also notice that, in Book iii. 1325, Chaucer bears testimony to the
'excellence' of his 'auctor.' The statement, in Book ii. 14, that he took
the story 'out of Latin' is less helpful than it appears to be; for 'Latin'
may mean either Latin or Italian.

§ 9. I have spoken (§ 4) of 'a particular case of borrowing,' which I now
propose to consider more particularly. The discovery that Chaucer mainly
drew his materials from Boccaccio seems to have satisfied most enquirers;
and hence it has come to pass that one of Chaucer's sources has been little
regarded, though it is really of some importance. I refer to the Historia
Troiana of Guido delle Colonne[49], or, as Chaucer rightly calls him, Guido
de Columpnis, i.e. Columnis (House of Fame, 1469). Chaucer's obligations to
this author have been insufficiently explored.

When, in 1889, in printing the Legend of Good Women with an accuracy never
before attempted, I restored the MS. reading _Guido_ for the _Ouyde_ of all
previous editions in l. 1396, a clue was thus obtained to a new source for
some of Chaucer's work. It was thus made clear that the Legend of Hypsipyle
and Medea was primarily derived from this source; and further, that it was
from Guido that Chaucer derived his use of _Ilioun_ to mean the citadel of
Troy (Leg. of Good Women, 936, and note). In the Nonne Prestes Tale, B
4331, as was pointed out by Tyrwhitt long ago, the dream of Andromache is
taken from Guido. And I find in Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, ii. 315,
the significant but insufficient remark, that 'it was in Guido da (_sic_)
Colonna's work that Chaucer found the martial deeds of Troilus recounted in
full, the slaughter he wrought, and the terror he inspired.' Hence we
naturally come to the question, what incidents in Troilus are expressly due
to Guido?

§ 10. Before answering this question, it will be best to consider the
famous _crux_, as to the meaning of the word _Trophee_.

When Lydgate is speaking of his master's Troilus, viz. in his Prologue to
the Falls of Princes, st. 3, he says that Chaucer

         'made a translacion
  Of a boke which called is _Trophe_
  In Lumbarde tong,' &c.

No book or author is now known by that name; and, as Chaucer was in this
case much indebted to Boccaccio, critics have jumped to the conclusion that
_Trophee_ means either Boccaccio or the Filostrato; and this conclusion has
been supported by arguments so hopeless as to need no repetition. But it is
most likely that Lydgate, who does not seem to have known any Italian[50],
spoke somewhat casually; and, as Chaucer was to some extent indebted to
Guido, he may possibly have meant Guido.

So far, I have merely stated a supposition which is, in itself, possible;
but I shall now adduce what I believe to be reasonable and solid proof of
it.

We have yet another mention of _Trophee_, viz. in Chaucer himself! In the
Monkes Tale, B 3307, he says of Hercules--

 'At bothe the worldes endes, _seith Trophee_,
  In stede of boundes, he a piler sette.'

Whence, we may ask, is this taken? My answer is, _from Guido_.

§ 11. If we examine the sources of the story of Hercules in the Monkes
Tale, we see that all the supposed facts _except_ the one mentioned in the
two lines above quoted are taken from Boethius and Ovid (see the Notes).
Now the next most obvious source of information was Guido's work, since the
very first Book has a good deal about Hercules, and the Legend of Hypsipyle
clearly shews us that Chaucer was aware of this. And, although neither Ovid
(in Met. ix.) nor Boethius has any allusion to the Pillars of Hercules,
they are expressly mentioned by Guido. In the English translation called
the Gest Historiale of the Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson
(which I call, for brevity, the alliterative Troy-book), l. 308, we read:--

 'But the wonders that he wroght in this world here
  In yche cuntré ben knowen under Criste evyn.
  Tow pyllers he pight in a place lowe
  Vppon Gades groundes, that he gotton had.'

And again, further on, the Latin text has:--'Locus ille, in quo predicte
_Herculis columpne_ sunt affixe, dicitur Saracenica lingua Saphy.' To which
is added, that Alexander afterwards came to the same spot.

When Lydgate, in translating Guido, comes to this passage, he says:--

   'And of the pyllers that at Gades he set,
  Which Alexsaundre, of Macedone the kyng,
  That was so worthy here in his lyuynge,
  Rood in his conquest, as _Guydo_ list to write,
  With all his hoost proudely to visyte ...
  And these boundes named be of all
  Of Hercules, for he hymselfe theim set
  As for his markes, all other for to lette
  Ferther to passe, as _Guydo_ maketh mynde'; &c.
                            Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. B6.

We can now easily see that, when Lydgate speaks of the book 'which called
is Trophe in Lumbarde tong,' he is simply copying the name of the book from
Chaucer, though he seems also to have heard some rumour of its being so
called in Italy.

§ 12. _Why_ this particular book was so called, we have no means of
knowing[51]; but this does not invalidate the fact here pointed out. Of
course the Latin side-note in some of the MSS. of the Monkes Tale, which
explains 'Trophee' as referring to 'ille vates Chaldeorum Tropheus,' must
be due to some mistake, even if it emanated (as is possible) from Chaucer
himself. It is probable that, when the former part of the Monkes Tale was
written, Chaucer did not know much about Guido's work; for the account of
Hercules occurs in the very first chapter. Perhaps he confused the name of
Tropheus with that of Trogus, i.e. Pompeius Trogus the historian, whose
work is one of the authorities for the history of the Assyrian monarchy.

§ 13. It remains for me to point out some of the passages in Troilus which
are clearly due to Guido, and are not found in Boccaccio at all.

Book I. 145-7:--

 'But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,
  In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,
  Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.'

The reference here is simply to Guido's history, whence, and not at first
hand, both Chaucer and his readers could easily get the required
information. Guido constantly refers to these authors; and, although he
speaks disrespectfully of Homer[52], he professes to put great faith in
Dares and Dytes, whose names he frequently cites as being those of his best
authorities[53].

With the description of Troilus in ll. 1072-1085, it is interesting to
compare the words of Guido, in Book VIII. 'Troilus vero, licet multum fuit
corpore magnus, magis fuit tamen corde magnanimus; animosus multum, set
multam habuit in sua animositate temperiem; dilectus plurimum a puellis cum
ipse aliqualem seruando modestiam delectaretur in illis. In viribus et
strenuitate bellandi _uel fuit alius Hector uel secundus ab ipso_. In toto
eciam regno Troie iuuenis nullus fuit tantis viribus nec tanta audacia
gloriosus[54].' The latter part of this description should be compared with
Book II. 157-161, where the very phrase 'Ector the secounde' is used; see
also ll. 181-189.

§ 14. Book II. 618. 'The yate ... Of Dardanus.' The six gates of Troy are
named in Guido, Book IV, 'Quarum vna _Dardanides_, secunda Tymbrea, tercia
Helyas, quarta Chetas, quinta Troiana, vltima Anthenorides vocabantur.'

 'The furst and the fairest fourmet was Dardan.'
                                     Allit. Troy-book, l. 1557.

Lydgate keeps the form 'Dardanydes'; cap. xi. fol. F 5.

§ 15. Book IV. 204. 'For he was after traytour to the toun.' The treason of
Antenor is told by Guido at great length; see 'Boke xxviii' of the allit.
Troy-book, p. 364; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, Y 6, back. Cf. Dictys
Cretensis, lib. iv. c. 22.

Book IV. 1397, &c. 'For al Apollo and his clerkish lawes,' &c. Guido gives
rather a long account of the manner in which Criseyde upbraided her father
Chalcas at their meeting. Chaucer says nothing about this matter in Book V.
193, but he here introduces an account of the same speech, telling us that
Creseyde _intended_ to make it! I quote from Book XIX. 'Sane deceperunt te
Apollinis friuola responsa, a quo dicis te suscepisse mandatum vt tu
paternas Lares desereres, et tuos in tanta acerbitate Penates[55] sic tuis
specialiter hostibus adhereres. Sane non fuit ille deus Apollo, set, puto,
fuit comitiua infernalium Furiarum a quibus responsa talia recepisti.' Cf.
allit. Troy-book, 8103-40; and observe that Lydgate, in his Siege of Troye,
R 3, back, omits the speech of Criseyde to her father, on the ground that
it is given in Chaucer. Yet such is not the case, unless we allow the
present passage to stand for it. In Book V. 194, Chaucer (following
Boccaccio) expressly says that she was _mute_!

Book IV. 1695-1701. This last stanza is not in Boccaccio; but the general
sense of it is in Guido, Book XIX, where the interview ends thus:--'Set
diei Aurora quasi superueniente uicina, Troilus a Brisaida in multis
anxietatibus et doloribus discessit; et ea relicta ad sui palacii menia
properauit.' Lydgate, at this point, refers us to Chaucer; Siege of Troye,
fol. R 2, back. The allit. Troy-book actually does the same; l. 8054.

§ 16. Book V. 92-189. These fourteen stanzas are not in Boccaccio. The
corresponding passage in Guido (Book XIX) is as follows:--

'Troilus et Troiani redeunt, Grecis eam recipientibus in suo commeatu.
Inter quos dum esset Diomedes, et illam Diomedes inspexit, statim in ardore
veneris exarsit et eam vehementi desiderio concupiuit, qui collateralis
associando Brisaidam cum insimul equitarent, sui ardoris flammam continere
non valens Brisaide reuelat sui estuantis cordis amorem; quam in multis
affectuosis verbis et blandiciis necnon et promissionibus reuera magnificis
allicere satis humiliter est rogatus. Set Brisaida in primis monitis, vt
mulierum moris est, suum prestare recusauit assensum; nec tamen passa est
quin post multa Diomedis verba, ipsum nolens a spe sua deicere verbis
similibus dixit ei: "Amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec
admitto, cum cor meum non sit ad presens ita dispositum quod tibi possim
aliter respondere."'

Book V. 799-805[56]. The description of Diomede in Boccaccio (Fil. VI. 33)
is merely as follows:--

 'Egli era grande e bel della persona,
  Giovane fresco e piacevole assai,
  E forte e fier siccome si ragiona,
  E parlante quant'altro Greco mai,
  E ad amor la natura aveva prona.'

The account in Guido (Book VIII) is as follows:--'Diomedes vero multa fuit
proceritate, distensus amplo pectore, robustis scapulis, aspectu ferox; in
promissis fallax; in armis strenuus; victorie cupidus; timendus a multis,
cum multum esset iniuriosus; sermonibus sibi nimis impaciens, cum molestus
seruientibus nimis esset; libidinosus quidem multum, et qui multas traxit
angustias ob feruorem amoris.' Cf. allit. Troy-book, ll. 3794-3803;
Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. K 1, back.

Book V. 810. To gon y-tressed, &c. Perhaps suggested by the remark in Guido
(Book XIX) that Cressid's hair was unbound in her hour of deepest
sorrow:--'aureos crines suos a lege ligaminis absolutos a lactea sui
capitis cute diuellit.' Cf. IV. 736.

Book V. 827-840. Troilus is not described by Boccaccio. Guido's description
of him has already been quoted above; see remarks on Book I. 1072; pp. lvi,
lvii.

Book V. 1002-4. The parallel passage in Guido has already been quoted,
viz.: 'Amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec admitto.' See
remarks on l. 92; p. lviii.

Book V. 1013. Obviously from Guido; the passage follows soon after that
last quoted. 'Associauit [Diomedes] eam vsquequo Brisaida recipere in sui
patris tentoria se debebat. Et ea perueniente ibidem, ipse eam ab equo
descendentem promptus adiuit, et vnam de cirothecis[57], quam Brisaida
gerebat in manu, ab ea nullo percipiente furtiue subtraxit. Set cum ipsa
sola presensit, placitum furtum dissimulauit amantis.'

For this incident of the glove, cf. allit. Troy-book, l. 8092.

Book V. 1023-1099. This passage is not in Boccaccio. Several hints for it
seem to have been taken from Guido, Book XIX, whence I quote the following.

'Nondum dies illa ad horas declinauerat vespertinas, cum iam suas Brisaida
recentes mutauerat voluntates,' &c.. 'Et iam nobilis Troili amor ceperat in
sua mente tepescere, et sic repente subito facta volubilis se in omnibus
variauit. Quid est ergo quod dicitur de constancia mulierum,' &c.

'Tunc ilico Diomedes superuenit . . qui repente in Troilum irruit, ipsum ab
equo prosternit, ab eo auferens equum suum, quem per suum nuncium specialem
ad Brisaidam in exennium[58] destinauit, mandans nuncio suo predicto vt
Brisaide nunciet equum ipsum eius fuisse dilecti . . . . Brisaida vero
equum Troili recepit hilariter, et ipsi nuncio refert hec verba: "Dic
secure domino tuo quod ilium odio habere non possum, qui me tanta puritate
cordis affectat . . . . [Diomedes] Brisaidam accedit, et eam suplex
hortatur vt sibi consenciat in multitudine lacrimarum. Set illa, que multum
vigebat sagacitatis astucia, Diomedem sagacibus machinacionibus differre
procurat, ut ipsum afflictum amoris incendio magis affligat, et eius amoris
vehemenciam in maioris augmentum ardoris extollat. Vnde Diomedi suum amorem
non negat, etiam nec promittit."'

In l. 1039, read _he_, i. e. Diomede; see my note on the line, at p. 499.

In l. 1037, _the story_ means the Historia Troiana; and in l. 1044, _in the
stories elles-where_ means 'elsewhere in the same History.' The passage (in
Book XXV) is as follows:--

'Troilus autem tunc amorem Brisaide Diomedi obprobriosis verbis improperat;
set Greci Diomedem ... abstraxerunt' ...

'Interim Brisaida contra patris sui voluntatem videre Diomedem in lecto suo
iacentem ex vulnere sibi facto frequenter accedit, et licet sciuisset illum
a Troilo dudum dilecto suo sic vulneratum, multa tamen in mente sua
reuoluit; et dum diligenter attendit de se iungenda cum Troilo nullam sibi
superesse fiduciam, totum suum animum, tanquam varia et mutabilis, sicut
est proprium mulierum, in Diomedis declinat amorem.'

Cf. Troy-book, ll. 9942-59; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. U 4.

Book V. 1558-60. The treacherous slaughter of Hector by Achilles is in
Guido, near the end of Book XXV. See my note to l. 1558, at p. 503.

Book V. 1771. 'Read Dares.' This merely means that Guido cites Dares as his
authority for the mighty deeds of Troilus. In Book XXV, I find:--'_Scripsit
enim Dares_, quod illo die _mille_ milites interfecit [Troilus] ex Grecis';
cf. l. 1802 below. So in the allit. Troy-book, ll. 9877-9:--

 'As _Dares_ of his dedis duly me tellus,
  A thowsaund thro knightes throng he to dethe,
  That day with his dynttes, of the derffe Grekes.'

So Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. U 3, back:--

 'And, as _Dares_ wryteth specyally,
  A thousand knightes this Troyan champyowne
  That day hath slayne, rydyng vp and downe,
  As myne auctour Guydo lyst endyte;
  _Saue after hym_, I can no ferther wryte.'

I. e. he only knew of Dares through the medium of Guido. In fact, Dares
(capp. 29, 31, 32) has 'multos,' not 'mille.'

Book V. 1849-1855. The introduction of this stanza is quite irrelevant,
unless we remember that, in Guido, the story of Troy is completely mixed up
with invectives against idolatry. In Book X, there is a detailed account of
the heathen gods, the worship of which is attributed to the instigation of
fiends. See the long account in the allit. Troy-book, ll. 4257-4531,
concluding with the revelation by Apollo to Calchas of the coming fall of
Troy. Cf. Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. K 6. Of course, this notion of the
interference of the gods in the affairs of the Greeks and Trojans is
ultimately due to Homer.

§ 17. With regard to the statement in Guido, that Achilles slew Hector
_treacherously_, we must remember how much turns upon this assertion. His
object was to glorify the Trojans, the supposed ancestors of the Roman
race, and to depreciate the Greeks. The following passage from Guido, Book
XXV, is too characteristic to be omitted. 'Set o Homere, qui in libris tuis
Achillem tot laudibus, tot preconiis extulisti, _que probabilis racio_ te
induxit, vt Achillem tantis probitatis meritis vel titulis exultasses?'
Such was the general opinion about Homer in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries.

§ 18. This is not the place for a full consideration of the further
question, as to the sources of information whence Boccaccio and Guido
respectively drew their stories. Nor is it profitable to search the
supposed works of Dares and Dictys for the passages to which Chaucer
appears to refer; since he merely knew those authors by name, owing to
Guido's frequent appeals to them. Nevertheless, it is interesting to find
that Guido was quite as innocent as were Chaucer and Lydgate of any
knowledge of Dares and Dictys at first hand. He acquired his great
reputation in the simplest possible way, by stealing the whole of his
'History' bodily, from a French romance by Benoît de Sainte-More, entitled
_Le Roman de Troie_, which has been well edited and discussed by Mons. A.
Joly. Mons. Joly has shewn that the _Roman de Troie_ first appeared between
the years 1175 and 1185; and that Guido's _Historia Troiana_ is little more
than an adaptation of it, which was completed in the year 1287, without any
acknowledgment as to its true source.

Benoît frequently cites Dares (or Daires), and at the end of his poem, ll.
30095-6, says:--

 'Ce que dist Daires et Dithis
  I avons si retreit et mis.'

In his Hist. of Eng. Literature (E. version, ii. 113), Ten Brink remarks
that, whilst Chaucer prefers to follow Guido rather than Benoît in his
Legend of Good Women, he 'does the exact opposite to what he did in
Troilus.' For this assertion I can find but little proof. It is hard to
find anything in Benoît's lengthy Romance which he may not have taken, much
more easily, from Guido. There are, however, just a few such points in Book
V. 1037-1078. Thus, in l. 1038, Criseyde gives Diomede Troilus' horse; cf.
Benoît, l. 15046--'lo cheval Vos presterai.' L. 1043 is from the same, ll.
15102-4:--

 'La destre manche de son braz
  Bone et fresche de ciclaton
  Li done en leu de gonfanon.'

Ll. 1051-7 answer to the same, beginning at l. 20233; and l. 1074 is from
the same, l. 20308:--'Dex donge bien à Troylus!' I doubt if there is much
more.

For some further account of the works ascribed to Dares Phrygius and Dictys
Cretensis, both duly edited among the 'Delphin Classics,' I must refer the
reader to Smith's Classical Dictionary.

§ 19. The whole question of the various early romances that relate to Troy
is well considered in a work entitled 'Testi Inediti di Storia Trojana,
preceduti da uno studio sulla Leggenda Trojana in Italia, per Egidio Gorra;
Torino, 1887'; where various authorities are cited, and specimens of
several texts are given. At p. 136 are given the very lines of Benoît's
_Roman_ (ll. 795-6) where Guido found a reference to the columns of
Hercules:--

 'Et les bonnes ilec ficha
  Ou Alixandre les trova.'

This hint he has somewhat elaborated, probably because he took a personal
interest in 'columns,' on account of their reference to his own
name--'delle Colonne.' I believe that the notion of Alexander finding
Hercules' Pillars is due to a rather large blunder in geography. Hercules
set up his pillars 'at the end of the world,' viz. at the straits of
Gibraltar, whereas Alexander set up his at another 'end of the world,' viz.
at the furthest point of India which he succeeded in reaching. So says his
Romance; see Alexander and Dindimus, ed. Skeat, l. 1137; Wars of Alexander,
l. 5063. The setting up of pillars as boundary-marks seems to have been
common; cf. Vergil, Æn. xi. 262. Among the points noticed by Gorra, I may
mention the following:--

1. Some account (p. 7) of the Ephemeris Belli Troiani by Dictys Cretensis,
who, it was pretended, accompanied Idomeneus to the Trojan war. Achilles is
depicted in dark colours; he is treacherous towards Agamemnon; falls in
love with the Trojan princess, Polyxena; and slays Hector by a stratagem.
It appears to have been a work of invention, resting upon no Greek
original.

2. Some account (p. 17) of the Historia de Excidio Troiae of Dares
Phrygius, a work which (as was pretended) was discovered by Cornelius
Nepos. This also, in the opinion of most critics, was an original work. At
p. 115, there is a comparison of the lists of Greek leaders and the number
of their ships (cf. Homer, Il. ii.) as given by Dares, Benoît, and Guido.

3. At p. 123, there is an enumeration of points in which Guido varies from
Benoît.

4. At p. 152, is an account of some Italian prose versions of the story of
Troy. Such are: La Istorietta Trojana, with extracts from it at p. 371; a
romance by Binduccio dello Scelto, with extracts relating to 'Troilo e
Briseida' at p. 404; a version of Guido by Mazzeo Bellebuoni, with extracts
relating to 'Paride ed Elena' at p. 443; an anonymous version, with
extracts relating to 'Giasone e Medea' at p. 458; a version in the Venetian
dialect, with extracts relating to 'Ettore ed Ercole' at p. 481; another
anonymous version, with extracts at p. 493; and La 'Fiorita' of Armannino,
Giudice da Bologna, with extracts at p. 532.

5. At p. 265, is an account of Italian poetical versions, viz. Enfances
Hector, Poema d'Achille, Il Trojano di Domenico da Montechiello, Il Trojano
a stampa (i.e. a printed edition of Il Trojano), and L'Intelligenza. At p.
336, Boccaccio's Filostrato is discussed; followed by a brief notice of an
anonymous poem, also in ottava rima, called Il cantare di Insidoria. It
appears that Boccaccio followed some recension of the French text of
Benoît, but much of the work is his own invention. In particular, he
created the character of Pandaro, who resembles a Neapolitan courtier of
his own period.

The most interesting of the extracts given by Gorra are those from
Binduccio dello Scelto; at p. 411, we have the incident of Diomede
possessing himself of Briseida's glove, followed by the interview between
Briseida and her father Calcas. At p. 413, Diomede overthrows Troilus,
takes his horse from him and sends it to Briseida, who receives it
graciously; and at p. 417, Briseida gives Diomede her sleeve as a
love-token, after which a 'jousting' takes place between Diomede and
Troilus, in which the former is badly wounded.

For further remarks, we are referred, in particular, to H. Dunger's
Dictys-Septimius: über die ursprüngliche Abfassung und die Quellen der
Ephemeris belli Troiani; Dresden, 1878 (Programm des Vitzthumschen
Gymnasiums); to another essay by the same author on Die Sage vom
trojanischen Kriege, Leipzig, 1869; to Koerting's Dictys und Dares, &c.,
Halle, 1874; to A. Joly's Benoît de Sainte-More et le Roman de Troie,
Paris, 1871; and to an article by C. Wagener on Dares Phrygius, in
_Philologus_, vol. xxxviii. The student may also consult E. Meybrinck, Die
Auffassung der Antike bei Jacques Millet, Guido de Columna, und Benoît de
Ste-More, printed in Ausgaben und Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete für
Romanischen Philologie, Marburg, 1886; where the author concludes that
Millet was the originator of the story in France. Also W. Greif, Die
mittelalterlichen Bearbeitungen der Trojanersage; Marburg, 1886.

§ 20. A few words may be said as to the names of the characters. Troilus is
only once mentioned in Homer, where he is said to be one of the sons of
Priam, who were slain in battle, Iliad, xxiv. 257; so that his story is of
medieval invention, except as to the circumstance of his slayer being
Achilles, as stated by Vergil, Æn. i. 474, 475; cf. Horace, Carm. ii. 9.
16. Pandarus occurs as the name of two distinct personages; (1) a Lycian
archer, who wounded Menelaus; see Homer, Il. iv. 88, Vergil, Æn. 5. 496;
and (2) a companion of Æneas, slain by Turnus; see Vergil, Æn. ix. 672, xi.
396. Diomede is a well-known hero in the Iliad, but his love-story is of
late invention. The heroine of Benoît's poem is Briseida, of whom Dares (c.
13) has merely the following brief account: 'Briseidam formosam, alta
statura, candidam, capillo flauo et molli, superciliis junctis[59], oculis
venustis, corpore aequali, blandam, affabilem, uerecundam, animo simplici,
piam'; but he records nothing more about her. The name is simply copied
from Homer's [Greek: Brisêida], Il. i. 184, the accusative being taken (as
often) as a new nominative case; this Briseis was the captive assigned to
Achilles. But Boccaccio substitutes for this the form Griseida, taken from
the accusative of Homer's Chryseis, mentioned just two lines above, Il. i.
182. For this Italian form Chaucer substituted Criseyde, a trisyllabic
form, with the _ey_ pronounced as the _ey_ in _prey_. He probably was led
to this correction by observing the form Chryseida in his favourite author,
Ovid; see Remed. Amoris, 469. Calchas, in Homer, Il. i. 69, is a Grecian
priest; but in the later story he becomes a Trojan soothsayer, who,
foreseeing the destruction of Troy, secedes to the Greek side, and is
looked upon as a traitor. Cf. Vergil, Æn. ii. 176; Ovid, Art. Amat. ii.
737.

§ 21. In Anglia, xiv. 241, there is a useful comparison, by Dr. E. Köppel,
of the parallel passages in Troilus and the French Roman de la Rose, ed.
Méon, Paris, 1814, which I shall denote by 'R.' These are mostly pointed
out in the Notes. Köppel's list is as follows:--

Troilus. I. 635 (cf. III. 328).--Rom. Rose, 8041. 637.--R. 21819. 747.--R.
7595. 810.--R. 21145. 969--R. 12964.

II. 167.--R. 5684. 193.--R. 8757. 716.--R. 5765. 754.--R. 6676. 784 (cf.
III. 1035).--R. 12844. 1564.--R. 18498.

III. 294.--R. 7085. 328; _see_ I. 635. 1035; _see_ II. 784. 1634.--R. 8301.

IV. 7.--R. 8076. 519.--R. 6406. 1398.--R. 6941.

V. 365.--R. 18709.

Some of the resemblances are but slight; but others are obvious. The
numbers refer to the beginning of a passage; sometimes the really
coincident lines are found a little further on.

The parallel passages common to Troilus and Boethius are noted above, pp.
xxviii-xxx.

An excellent and exhaustive treatise on the Language of Chaucer's Troilus,
by Prof. Kitteredge, is now (1893) being printed for the Chaucer Society. A
Ryme-Index to the same, compiled by myself, has been published for the same
society, dated 1891.

§ 22. I have frequently alluded above to the alliterative 'Troy-book,' or
'Gest Historiale,' edited for the Early English Text Society, in 1869-74,
by Panton and Donaldson. This is useful for reference, as being a tolerably
close translation of Guido, although a little imperfect, owing to the loss
of some leaves and some slight omissions (probably) on the part of the
scribe. It is divided into 36 Books, which agree, very nearly, with the
Books into which the original text is divided. The most important passages
for comparison with Troilus are lines 3922-34 (description of Troilus);
3794-3803 (Diomede); 7268-89 (fight between Troilus and Diomede); 7886-7905
(Briseida and her dismissal from Troy); 8026-8181 (sorrow of Troilus and
Briseida, her departure, and the interviews between Briseida and Diomede,
and between her and Calchas her father); 8296-8317 (Diomede captures
Troilus' horse, and presents it to Briseida); 8643-60 (death of Hector);
9671-7, 9864-82, 9926-9 (deeds of Troilus); 9942-59 (Briseida visits the
wounded Diomede); 10055-85, 10252-10311 (deeds of Troilus, and his death);
10312-62 (reproof of Homer for his false statements).

At l. 8053, we have this remarkable allusion; speaking of Briseida and
Troilus, the translator says:--

 'Who-so wilnes to wit of thaire wo fir [futher],
  Turne hym to TROILUS, and talke[60] there ynoughe!'

I.e. whoever wishes to know more about their wo, let him turn to TROILUS,
and there find enough. This is a clear allusion to Chaucer's work by its
name, and helps to date the translation as being later than 1380 or 1382.
And, as the translator makes no allusion to Lydgate's translation of Guido,
the date of which is 1412-20, we see that he probably wrote between 1382
and 1420[61]; so that the date 'about 1400,' adopted in the New Eng.
Dictionary (s. v. _Bercelet_, &c.) cannot be far wrong[62].

§ 23. Another useful book, frequently mentioned above, is Lydgate's Siege
of Troye[61], of which I possess a copy printed in 1555. This contains
several allusions to Chaucer's Troilus, and more than one passage in praise
of Chaucer's poetical powers, two of which are quoted in Mr. Rossetti's
remarks on MS. Harl. 3943 (Chaucer Soc. 1875), pp. x, xi. These passages
are not very helpful, though it is curious to observe that he speaks of
Chaucer not only as 'my maister Chaucer,' but as 'noble Galfride, chefe
Poete of Brytaine,' and 'my maister Galfride.' The most notable passages
occur in cap. xv, fol. K 2; cap. xxv, fol. R 2, back; and near the end,
fol. Ee 2. Lydgate's translation is much more free than the preceding one,
and he frequently interpolates long passages, besides borrowing a large
number of poetical expressions from his 'maister.'

§ 24. Finally, I must not omit to mention the remarkable poem by Robert
Henrysoun, called the Testament and Complaint of Criseyde, which forms a
sequel to Chaucer's story. Thynne actually printed this, in his edition of
1532, as one of Chaucer's poems, immediately after Troilus; and all the
black-letter editions follow suit. Yet the 9th and 10th stanzas contain
these words, according to the edition of 1532:--

 'Of his distresse me nedeth nat reherse;
  For worthy Chaucer, in that same boke,
  In goodly termes, and in ioly verse,
  Compyled hath his cares, who wyl loke.
  To breke my slepe, another queare I toke,
  In whiche I founde the fatal desteny
  Of fayre Creseyde, whiche ended wretchedly.

  Who wot if al that Chaucer wrate was trewe?
  Nor I wotte nat if this narration
  Be authorysed, or forged of the newe
  Of some poete by his inuention,
  Made to reporte the lamentation
  And woful ende of this lusty Creseyde,
  And what distresse she was in or she deyde.'

§ 25. THE MANUSCRIPTS.

1. MS. CL.--The Campsall MS., on vellum, written before 1413; prepared for
Henry, Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry V, as shewn by his arms on leaf 2.
The poem occupies leaves 2-120; each page usually contains five stanzas.
Two pages have been reproduced by the autotype process for the Chaucer
Society; viz. leaf 1, recto, containing stanzas 1-5, and leaf 42, verso,
containing stanzas 249-251 of Book II, and stanza 1 of Book III. This is a
beautifully written MS., and one of the best; but it is disappointing to
find that it might easily have been much better. The scribe had a still
better copy before him, which he has frequently treated with supreme
carelessness; but it is some consolation to find that his mistakes are so
obvious that they can easily be corrected. Thus, in Book I, l. 27, he
writes _dorst_ for _dorste_, though it ruins the grammar and the metre; in
l. 31, he actually has _hym_ for _hem_, to the destruction of the sense; in
l. 69, he has _high_ (!) for _highte_; and so on. It therefore requires
careful control. In particular, the scribe gives many examples of the fault
of 'anticipation,' i.e. the fault whereby the mind, swifter than the pen,
has induced him to write down letters that belong to a _later_ syllable or
word, or to omit one or more letters. Thus in Book I. l. 80, he omits _u_
in _pryuely_, writing _pryely_; in l. 126, he omits _and_ before _hoom_; in
l. 198, he omits _lewede_; in l. 275, he omits _gan_; &c. But the faults of
'anticipation' appear most clearly in such startling forms as _addermost_
for _aldermost_, I. 248, where the former _d_ is due to the one that is
coming; _assent_ for _absent_, IV. 1642, for a like reason; _estal_ for
_estat_, because the next word is _royal_, I. 432; _þyn_ for _þyng_,
because the next word is _myn_, I. 683; _nat_ for _nas_, because the next
word is _not_, I. 738; _seynt_ for _seyn_, because the next word is _that_,
V. 369; _shad_ for _shal_, because the next word is _drede_, V. 385;
_liten_ for _litel_, because _weten_ follows, IV. 198; _make_ for _may_,
because the line ends with _wake_, III. 341; _fleld_ for _feld_, II. 195.
Sometimes, however, the scribe's mind reverts to something already written,
so that we find _Delphebus_ for _Delphicus_, because _Phebus_ precedes, I.
70; _bothen_ for _bothe_, because _deden_ precedes, I. 82; _falles_ for
_fallen_, after _unhappes_, II. 456; _daunder_ for _daunger_, III. 1321;
_tolle_ for _tolde_, III 802; &c. Downright blunders are not uncommon; as
_incocent_ for _innocent_ (where again the former _c_ is due to the
latter), II. 1723; _agarst_ for _agast_, III. 737; _right_ for _rit_, V.
60. We even find startling variations in the reading, as in III. 1408:--

 'Reson wil not that I speke of _shep_,
  For it accordeth nough[t] to my matere.'

Certainly, _shep_ (sheep) is irrelevant enough; however, Chaucer refers to
_sleep_. And again, the line in II. 1554, which should run--

  As for to bidde a wood man for to renne

appears in the startling form--

  As for to bydde a womman for to renne.

As all the variations of 'Cl.' from the correct text are given in the
foot-notes, it is not necessary to say more about these peculiarities. I
must add, however, that, as in Boethius, I have silently corrected _yn_ to
_in_ in such words as _thing_; besides altering _ee_ and _oo_ to _e_ and
_o_ in open syllables, writing _v_ for _u_, and the like. See above.

The Campsall MS., now in the possession of Mr. Bacon Frank, has been
printed in full, as written, for the Chaucer Society; and I have relied
upon the accuracy of this well-edited print.

2. MS. CP.--MS. No. 61 in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, described in
Nasmith's Catalogue, p. 40, as 'a parchment book in folio neatly written,
and ornamented with a frontispiece richly illuminated, containing Chaucer's
Troilus, in four [_error for_ five] books.' It is a fine folio MS., 12
inches by 8½. This MS., noticed by Warton, has not as yet been printed,
though the Chaucer Society have undertaken to print it, upon my
recommendation. It contains many pages that are left wholly or partially
blank, obviously meant to be supplied with illuminations; which shews that
it was written for some wealthy person. On the left margin, near the 83rd
stanza of Book IV, is a note of ownership, in a hand of the fifteenth
century--'neu_er_ foryeteth: Anne neuyll.' This probably refers to Anne
Neville, wife of Humphrey, duke of Buckingham (who was killed at
Northampton in 1460), and daughter of Ralph Neville, earl of Westmoreland,
and of Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt. That is, she was John of
Gaunt's granddaughter; and it seems reasonable to infer that the MS. was
actually written for one of John of Gaunt's family. This probability is a
very interesting one, when we consider how much Chaucer owed to John of
Gaunt's favour and protection.

The MS. is slightly deficient, owing to the omission of a few stanzas; but
not much is missing. It is of a type closely resembling the preceding, and
gives excellent readings. I have therefore taken the opportunity of
founding the text upon a close collation of Cl. and Cp., taking Cl. as the
foundation, but correcting it by Cp. throughout, without specifying more
than the rejected reading of Cl. in passages where these MSS. differ. In
this way the numerous absurdities of Cl. (as noted above) have been easily
corrected, and the resulting text is a great improvement upon all that have
hitherto appeared. In a few places, as shewn by the foot-notes, the
readings of other MSS. have been preferred.

3. MS. H.--MS. Harl. 2280, in the British Museum. An excellent MS., very
closely related to both the preceding. Printed in full for the Chaucer
Society, and collated throughout in the present edition. It was taken as
the basis of the text in Morris's Aldine edition, which in many passages
closely resembles the present text. It is certainly the third best MS. One
leaf is missing (Bk. V. 1345-1428; twelve stanzas).

4. MS. CM.--MS. Gg. 4. 27, in the Cambridge University Library; the same
MS. as that denoted by 'Cm.' in the foot-notes to the Canterbury Tales, and
by 'C.' in the foot-notes to the Legend of Good Women. A remarkable MS.,
printed in full for the Chaucer Society. It exhibits _a different type_ of
text from that found in Cl., Cp., and H. The most noteworthy differences
are as follows. In Bk. ii. 734, 5, this MS. has quite a different couplet,
viz.:

  Men louyn women þ_our_ al þis tou_n_ aboute;
  Be þey þe wers? whi, nay, w_i_t_h_-outyn doute.

Bk. ii. 792 runs thus:--

  How ofte tyme may men rede and se.

Bk. iv. 309-15 (stanza 45) runs thus:--

  What shulde ye don but, for myn disconfort,
  Stondyn for nought, and wepyn out youre ye?
  Syn sche is queynt that wont was yow disport[63],
  In vayn from this forth have I seyn twye;
  For[64] medycyn youre vertu is a-weye;
  O crewel eyen, sythyn that youre dispyt
  Was al to sen Crisseydes eyen bryght.

Bk. iv. 638 runs thus:--

  Pandare answerde, of that be as be may.

After Bk. iv. 735, MS. Cm. introduces the following stanza, which, in the
present text, appears a little later (ll. 750-6) in a slightly altered
form.

  The salte teris fro_m_ hyre ey[gh]yn tweyn
  Out ran, as scho_ur_ of aprille, ful swythe;
  Hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne,
  Aftyr the deth cryede a thousent sithe,
  Syn he that wonyt was hir wo for to lythe,
  Sche mot forgon; for which disauenture
  Sche held hire-selue a for-lost creature.

Bk. iv. 806-33 (four stanzas) are omitted; so also are the 18 stanzas
referring to Free-Will, viz. Bk. iv. 953-1078. Bk. v. 230-1 runs thus:--

  To whom for eu_er_emor myn herte is holde:
  And thus he pleynyd, and ferth_er_e-more he tolde.

We cannot believe that Bk. iv. 309-15, as here given, can be genuine[65];
but it seems possible that some of the other readings may be so. The
stanza, Bk. iv. 750-6, as here given, seems to represent the first draft of
these lines, which were afterwards altered to the form in which they appear
in the text, whilst at the same time the stanza was shifted down. However,
this is mere speculation; and it must be confessed that, in many places,
this MS. is strangely corrupted. Several stanzas have only six lines
instead of seven, and readings occur which set all ideas of rime at
defiance. Thus, in I. 1260, _paste_ (riming with _caste_) appears as
_passede_; in I. 1253, _ryde_ (riming with _aspyde_) appears as _rydende_;
in III. 351, _hayes_ (riming with _May is_) appears as _halis_; &c.

Yet the MS. is worth collating, as it gives, occasionally, some excellent
readings. For example, in Bk. i. 143, it preserves the word _here_, which
other MSS. wrongly omit; and, in the very next line, rightly has _to longe
dwelle_, not _to longe to dwelle_.

The MS. has been, at some time, shamefully maltreated by some one who has
cut out several leaves, no doubt for the sake of their illuminated
initials. Hence the following passages do not appear: I. 1-70; I. 1037--II.
84; III. 1-56; III. 1807--IV. 112; IV. 1667--V. 35; V. 1702--_end_
(_together with a piece at the beginning of the_ Canterbury Tales).

5. MS. H2.--Harleian MS. 3943, in the British Museum. Printed in full for
the Chaucer Society in 1875, together with a most valuable line by line
collation with Boccaccio's Filostrato, by Wm. Michael Rossetti. Referred to
in Prof. Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, i. 398, as 'much the worst that
has been printed,' where his object is to depreciate its authority. Yet it
is well worth a careful study, and it must be particularly borne in mind
that it consists of two parts, written at different dates, and of different
value. In Bell's Chaucer, we read of it:--'Unfortunately it is imperfect.
The first few leaves, and the whole of the latter part of the poem, appear
to have been destroyed, and the deficiency supplied by a later copyist.'
The late hand occurs in I. 1-70, 498-567, III. 1429-1638, IV. 197--_end_,
and Book V.; and thus occupies a large portion of the MS. Moreover, two
leaves are lost after leaf 59, comprising III. 1289-1428; these are
supplied in Dr. Furnivall's edition from Harl. 1239, which accounts for the
extraordinary disorder in which these stanzas are arranged. The MS. also
omits III. 1744-1771, and some other stanzas occasionally.

This is one of those curious MSS. which, although presenting innumerable
corrupt readings (the worst being _Commodious_ for _Commeveden_ in III.
17), nevertheless have some points of contact with an excellent source. All
editors must have observed a few such cases. Thus, in II. 615, it happily
restores the right reading _latis_, where the ordinary reading _gates_ is
ludicrously wrong. In III. 49, it supplies the missing word _gladnes_. In
V. 8, it has 'The Auricomus tressed Phebus hie on lofte,' instead of 'The
golden tressed'; and this reading, though false, lets us into the secret of
the origin of this epithet, viz. that it translates the Latin _auricomus_;
see note to the line. In the very next line, V. 9, it preserves the correct
reading _bemes shene_[66], riming with _grene_, _quene_, where other MSS.
have _bemes clere_, a reminiscence of the opening line of Book III. Hence I
have carefully collated this MS., and all readings of value are given in
the Notes. See, e. g. III. 28, 49, 136, 551, 1268, 1703, &c.

6. MS. Harl. 1239 (B. M.). 'It is an oblong folio, written from the
beginning in a small, clear character, which ceases at an earlier place
[III. 231] than the change occurs in MS. 3943 [IV. 197], leaving the
remainder comparatively useless as an authority.'--Bell. Dr. Furnivall has
printed the passages in III. 1289-1428, and III. 1744-1771, from this MS.
to supply the gaps in H 2 (see above); we thus see that it transposes
several of the stanzas, and is but a poor authority.

7. MS. Harl. 2392 (B. M.).  A late MS. on paper, not very correct; once the
property of Sir H. Spelman. As an example of a strange reading, observe 'O
mortal Gower,' in V. 1856. Still, it has the correct reading _sheene_ in V.
9; and in III. 49, supplies the rare reading _gladnesse_, which is
necessary to the sense.

This MS. has a large number of notes and glosses. Some are of small
interest, but others are of value, and doubtless proceeded from the author
himself, as they furnish useful references and explanations. I here notice
the best of them.

II. 8. 'Cleo: domina eloquencie.' This view of Clio explains the context.

II. 784. Side-note: 'nota mendacium.' A remarkable comment.

II. 1238-9. 'Leuis impressio, leuis recessio.' Clearly, a proverb.

III. 933. 'Dulcarnon: i. fuga miserorum.' This proves that Chaucer confused
the 47th proposition of Euclid with the 5th; see note.

III. 1177. 'Beati misericordes'; from Matt. v. 7.

III. 1183. 'Petite et accipi[e]tis'; a remarkable comment.

III. 1415. 'Gallus vulgaris astrologus; Alanus, de Planctu Nature'; see
note.

III. 1417. 'Lucifera: Stella matutina.'

III. 1466. 'Aurora: amica solis'; shewing the confusion of _Tithonus_ with
_Titan_.

IV. 22. 'Herine (_sic_), furie infernales; unde Lucanus, me pronuba duxit
Herinis.' This proves that Chaucer really took the name from Lucan, Phars.
viii. 90, q. v.

IV. 32. 'Sol in Leone'; i. e. the sun was in Leo; see note.

IV. 600. 'Audaces fortuna iuuat'; error for 'Audentes'; see note.

IV. 790. 'Vmbra subit terras,' &c.; Ovid, Met. xi. 61.

IV. 836. 'Extrema gaudii luctus'; see note.

IV. 1138. 'Flet tamen, et tepide,' &c.; Ovid, Met. x. 500.

IV. 1504. 'Non est bonum perdere substantiam propter accidens.'

IV. 1540. 'Styx, puteus infernalis.' Chaucer's mistake.

V. 8. 'The gold-tressed Phebus,' glossed 'Auricomus Sol'; which is from
Valerius Flaccus; see note.

V. 319. Reference to Ovid's Metamorphoses; see note.

V. 655. 'Latona, i. luna'; shewing that 'Latona' is mis-written for
'Lucina.' Cf. IV. 1591.

V. 664. Reference to Ovid, Metam. ii. See note.

V. 1039. For 'she,' MS. has 'he,' correctly (see note); side-note, 'Nota,
de donis c. d.', i. e. of Criseyde to Diomede.

V. 1107. 'Laurigerus'; see note.

V. 1110. 'Nisus,' glossed 'rex'; 'douhter,' glossed 'alauda'; see note.

V. 1548. 'Parodye: duracio'; see note.

V. 1550. 'Vnbodye: decorporare.'

There are many more such glosses, of lesser interest.

8. MS. Harl. 4912 (B. M.). On vellum; rather large pages, with wide
margins; five stanzas on the page. Imperfect; ends at IV. 686. A poor copy.
In III. 49, it retains the rare reading 'gladnes,' but miswritten as
'glanes.'

9. MS. Addit. 12044 (B. M.). On vellum; five stanzas to the page. Last leaf
gone; ends at V. 1820. Not a good copy. In III. 17, it has 'Comeued hem,'
an obvious error for 'Comeueden,' which is the true reading. In V. 8, it
has 'golden dressed,' error for 'golden tressed.' Note this correct form
'golden'; for it is miswritten as 'gold' or 'golde' in nearly all other
copies.

The next four are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

10. Arch. Seld. B. 24 is the Scottish MS., dated 1472, described in the
Introduction to the Minor Poems, where it is denoted by 'Ar.,' and fully
collated throughout the Legend of Good Women, where it appears in the
foot-notes as 'A.' It seems to be the best of the Oxford MSS., and has some
good readings. In III. 17, it has 'Co_m_meued tham' for Commeueden,' which
is near enough for a MS. that so freely drops inflexions; and the line ends
with 'and amoreux tham made.' In III. 49, it correctly preserves
'gladness.'

11. MS. Rawlinson, Poet. 163. Not a very good copy. It omits the Prologue
to Book III. At the end is the colophon:--

              { Heer endith the book of }
 'Tregentyll {                         } Chaucer.'
              { Troylus and of Cresseyde}

I take 'Tregentyll' to be the scribe's name[67]. Besides the 'Troilus,' the
MS. contains, on a fly-leaf, the unique copy of the Balade to Rosemounde,
beneath which is written (as in the former case) 'tregentil' to the left of
the page, and 'chaucer' to the right; connected by a thin stroke. See my
'Twelve Facsimiles of Old English MSS.'; Plate XII.

12. MS. Arch. Seld. supra 56. Small quarto, 8 inches by 5½, on paper;
vellum binding; writing clear. A poor copy. The grammar shews a Northern
dialect.

13. MS. Digby 181. Incomplete; nearly half being lost. It ends at III.
532--'A certayn houre in which she come sholde.' A poor copy, closely
allied to the preceding. Thus, in III. 17, both have _moreux_ for
_amoreux_; in III. 2, both have _Adornes_; in III. 6, both absurdly have
_Off_ (_Of_) for _O_; and so on.

14. MS. L. 1, in St. John's College, Cambridge. A fair MS., perhaps earlier
than 1450. Subjoined to the Troilus is a sixteenth century copy of the
Testament of Creseide. Quarto; on vellum; 10 inches by 6½; in 10 sheets of
12 leaves each. Leaf g 12 is cut out, and g 11 is blank, but nothing seems
to be lost. It frequently agrees with Cp., as in I. 5, fro ye; 21, be this;
36, desespeyred; 45, fair ladys so; 70, Delphicus; 308, kan thus. In I.
272, it correctly has: p_er_cede; in 337, nou_n_c_er_teyne. In II. 734, it
agrees with H.; 735 runs--'And whan hem list no lenger, lat hem leue'; a
good line. In II. 894, it has 'mosten axe,' the very reading which I give;
and in II. 968, stalkes.

15. MS. Phillipps 8252; the same MS. as that described in my preface to the
C. text of Piers the Plowman, p. xix, where it is numbered XXVIII.

16. A MS. in the Library of Durham Cathedral, marked V. ii. 13. A single
stanza of Troilus, viz. I. 631-7, occurs in MS. R. 3. 20, in Trinity
College Library, Cambridge; and three stanzas, viz. III. 302-322, in MS.
Ff. 1. 6, leaf 150, in the Cambridge University Library; all printed in Odd
Texts of Chaucer's Minor Poems, ed. F. J. Furnivall, Chaucer Society, 1880,
pp. x-xii. In 1887, Dr. Stephens found two vellum strips in the cover of a
book, containing fragments of a MS. of Troilus (Book V. 1443-1498); see
Appendix to the Report of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, May 24, 1887;
pp. 331-5.

The MSS. fall, as far as I can tell, into two main families. The larger
family is that which resembles Cl., Cp., and H. Of the smaller, Cm. may be
taken as the type. The description of Cm. shews some of the chief
variations. Observe that many MSS. omit I. 890-6; in the John's MS., it is
inserted in a much later hand. The stanza is obviously genuine.

§ 26. THE EDITIONS. 'Troilus' was first printed by Caxton, about 1484; but
without printer's name, place, or date. See the description in Blades' Life
of Caxton, p. 297. There is no title-page. Each page contains five stanzas.
Two copies are in the British Museum; one at St. John's College, Oxford;
and one (till lately) was at Althorp. The second edition is by Wynkyn de
Worde, in 1517. The third, by Pynson, in 1526. These three editions present
Troilus as a separate work. After this, it was included in Thynne's edition
of 1532, and in all the subsequent editions of Chaucer's Works.

Of these, the only editions accessible to me have been Thynne's (1532), of
which there is a copy in the Cambridge University Library; also the
editions of 1550 (or thereabouts) and 1561, of both of which I possess
copies.

Thynne's edition was printed from so good a MS. as to render it an
excellent authority. In a few places, I fear he has altered the text for
the worse, and his errors have been carefully followed and preserved by
succeeding editors. Thus he is responsible for altering _io_ (= _jo_) into
_go_, III. 33; for creating the remarkable 'ghost-word' _gofysshe_, III.
584; and a few similar curiosities. But I found it worth while to collate
it throughout; and readings from it are marked 'Ed.' The later black-letter
copies are mere reproductions of it.

§ 27. THE PRESENT EDITION. The present edition has the great advantage of
being founded upon Cl. and Cp., neither of which have been previously made
use of, though they are the two best. Bell's text is founded upon the
Harleian MSS. numbered 1239, 2280, and 3943, in separate fragments; hence
the text is neither uniform nor very good. Morris's text is much better,
being founded upon H. (closely related to Cl. and Cp.), with a few
corrections from other unnamed sources.

Thanks to the prints provided by the Chaucer Society, I have been able to
produce a text which, I trust, leaves but little to be desired. I point out
some of the passages which now appear in a correct form for the first time,
as may be seen by comparison with the editions by Morris and Bell, which I
denote by M. and B.

I. 136; _derre_, dearer; M. B. dere (no rime). 285. _meninge_, i. e.
intention; _and so in_ l. 289; M. B. mevynge. 388. M. B. insert a semicolon
after _arten_. 465. _fownes_ (see note);  M. B. fantasye (line too long).
470 _felle_, fell, pl. adj.; M. B. fille, i. e. fell (verb). 590. _no
comfort_; M. comfort; B. eny comfort. 786. _Ticius_ (see note); M.
Syciphus; B. Siciphus. 896. _Thee oughte_; M. To oght (no sense); B. The
oght (will not scan). 1026. See note; put as a question in M. B.; B. even
inserts _not_ before _to done_. 1050. _me asterte_; M. may sterte; B. me
stert (better).

II. 41. _seyde_, i. e. if that they seyde; M. B. seyinge (will not scan).
138. _were_ (would there be); M. B. is. 180. _wight_; M. B. knyght (but see
l. 177). 808. _looth_; M. B. leve. 834. _Ye_; M. B. The. 1596. _For for_;
M. B. For.

III. 17. _Comeveden_ (see note); M. Comeneden; B. Commodious. _him_; M. B.
hem. 33. _io_ (= _jo_); M. B. go. 49. M. B. omit _gladnes_. 572. _Yow
thurfte_; M. Thow thruste; B. Yow durst. 584. _goosish_; M. goofish; B.
gofisshe. 674. M. Thei voide [_present_], dronke [_past_], and traveres
drawe [_present_] anon; B. They voyded, and drunk, and travars drew anone.
Really, _dronke_ and _drawe_ are both past participles; see note. 725.
_Cipris_; M. Cyphes; B. Ciphis. 1231. _Bitrent and wryth_, i. e. winds
about and wreathes itself; M. Bytrent and writhe is; B. Bitrent and writhen
is. _Wryth_ is short for _writheth_; not a pp. 1453. _bore_, i. e. hole; M.
boure; B. bowre. 1764. _to-hepe_, i. e. together; M. B. to kepe.

IV. 538. _kyth_; M. B. right (no sense). 696. _thing is_; M. B. thynges is.
 818. _martyre_; M. B. matere (neither sense nor rime).

V. 49. _helpen_; M. B. holpen. 469. _howve_; M. B. howen. 583. _in my_; M.
B. omit _my_. 927. _wight_; M. B. with. 1208. _trustinge_; M. B. trusten
(against grammar). 1266. _bet_; M. B. beste. 1335, 6. _wyte The teres_,
i. e. blame the tears; M. B. wite With teres. 1386. _Commeve_; M. Com in
to; B. Can meven. 1467. _She_; M. B. So. 1791. _pace_; M. B. space (see
note).

It is curious to find that such remarkable words as _commeveden_, _io_,
_voidee_, _goosish_, _to-hepe_, appear in no Chaucerian glossary; they are
only found in the MSS., being ignored in the editions.

A large number of lines are now, for the first time, spelt with forms that
comply with grammar and enable the lines to be scanned. For example, M. and
B. actually give _wente_ and _wonte_ in V. 546, instead of _went_ and
_wont_; _knotles_ for _knotteles_ in V. 769, &c.

I have also, for the first time, numbered the lines and stanzas correctly.
In M., Books III. and IV. are both misnumbered, causing much trouble in
reference. Dr. Furnivall's print of the Campsall MS. omits I. 890-6; and
his print of MS. Harl. 3943 counts in the Latin lines here printed at p.
404.

§ 28. It is worth notice that Troilus contains about fifty lines in which
the first foot consists of a single syllable. Examples in Book I are:--

  That | the hot-e fyr of lov' him brende: 490.
  Lov' | ayeins the which who-so defendeth: 603.
  Twen | ty winter that his lady wiste: 811.
  Wer' | it for my suster, al thy sorwe: 860.
  Next | the foule netle, rough and thikke: 948.
  Now | Pandar', I can no mor-e seye: 1051.
  Al | derfirst his purpos for to winne: 1069.

So also II. 369, 677, 934, 1034, 1623 (and probably 1687); III. 412, 526,
662, 855 (perhaps 1552), 1570; IV. 176, 601, 716, 842, 1328, 1676; V. 67
(perhaps 311), 334, 402, 802, 823, 825, 831, 880, 887, 949, 950, 1083,
1094, 1151, 1379, 1446, 1454, 1468, 1524.

It thus appears that deficient lines of this character are by no means
confined to the poems in 'heroic verse,' but occur in stanzas as well.
Compare the Parlement of Foules, 445, 569.

§ 29. PROVERBS. Troilus contains a considerable number of proverbs and
proverbial phrases or similes. See, e. g., I. 257, 300, 631, 638, 694, 708,
731, 740, 946-952, 960, 964, 1002, 1024; II. 343, 398, 403, 585, 784, 804,
807, 861, 867, 1022, 1030, 1041, 1238, 1245, 1332, 1335, 1380, 1387, 1553,
1745; III. 35, 198, 294, 308, 329, 405, 526, 711, 764, 775, 859, 861, 931,
1625, 1633; IV. 184, 415, 421, 460, 588, 595, 622, 728, 836, 1098, 1105,
1374, 1456, 1584; V. 484, 505, 784, 899, 971, 1174, 1265, 1433.

§ 30. A translation of the first two books of Troilus into Latin verse, by
Sir Francis Kinaston, was printed at Oxford in 1635. The volume also
contains a few notes, but I do not find in them anything of value. The
author tries to reproduce the English stanza, as thus:--

 'Dolorem Troili duplicem narrare,
  Qui Priami Regis Trojae fuit gnatus,
  Vt primùm illi contigit amare,
  Vt miser, felix, et infortunatus
  Erat, decessum ante sum conatus.
  Tisiphone, fer opem recensere
  Hos versus, qui, dum scribo, visi flere.'

For myself, I prefer the English.

§ 31. Hazlitt's Handbook to Popular Literature records the following
title:--'A Paraphrase vpon the 3 first bookes of Chaucer's Troilus and
Cressida. Translated into modern English ... by J[onathan] S[idnam]. About
1630. Folio; 70 leaves; in 7-line stanzas.'

_Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi._

  Allas! I, weping, am constreined to biginnen vers of sorowful
  matere, that whylom in florisching studie made delitable ditees.
  For lo! rendinge Muses of poetes endyten to me thinges to be
  writen; and drery vers of wrecchednesse weten my face with
  verray teres. At the leeste, no drede ne mighte overcomen tho           5
  Muses, that they ne weren felawes, and folweden my wey, _that is
  to seyn, whan I was exyled_; they that weren glorie of my youthe,
  whylom weleful and grene, comforten now the sorowful werdes of
  me, olde man. For elde is comen unwarly upon me, hasted by
  the harmes that I have, and sorow hath comaunded his age to be         10
  in me. Heres hore ben shad overtymeliche upon myn heved,
  and the slake skin trembleth upon myn empted body. Thilke
  deeth of men is weleful that ne cometh not in yeres that ben
  swete, but cometh to wrecches, often y-cleped.

  Allas! allas! with how deef an ere deeth, cruel, torneth awey          15
  fro wrecches, and naiteth to closen wepinge eyen! Whyl Fortune,
  unfeithful, favorede me with lighte goodes, the sorowful houre,
  _that is to seyn, the deeth_, hadde almost dreynt myn heved. But
  now, for Fortune cloudy hath chaunged hir deceyvable chere to
  me-ward, myn unpitous lyf draweth a-long unagreable dwellinges         20
  _in me_. O ye, my frendes, what or wherto avauntede ye me to
  ben weleful? for he that hath fallen stood nat in stedefast

PROSE I.

_Hec dum mecum tacitus ipse reputarem._

  Whyle that I stille recordede thise thinges with my-self, and
  markede my weeply compleynte with office of pointel, I saw,
  stondinge aboven the heighte of myn heved, a woman of ful greet
  reverence by semblaunt, hir eyen brenninge and cleer-seinge over
  the comune might of men; with a lyfly colour, and with swich            5
  vigour and strengthe that it ne mighte nat ben empted; al were it
  so that she was ful of so greet age, that men ne wolde nat trowen,
  in no manere, that she were of oure elde. The stature of hir was
  of a doutous Iugement; for som-tyme she constreinede and shronk
  hir-selven lyk to the comune mesure of men, and sum-tyme it            10
  semede that she touchede the hevene with the heighte of hir
  heved; and whan she heef hir heved hyer, she percede the
  selve hevene, so that the sighte of men looking was in ydel. Hir
  clothes weren maked of right delye thredes and subtil crafte, of
  perdurable matere; the whiche clothes she hadde woven with hir         15
  owene hondes, as I knew wel after by hir-self, declaringe and
  shewinge to me the beautee; the whiche clothes a derknesse of a
  forleten and dispysed elde hadde dusked and derked, as it is wont
  to derken bi-smokede images.

  In the nethereste hem or bordure of thise clothes men redden,          20
  y-woven in, a Grekissh P, _that signifyeth the lyf Actif_; and aboven
  that lettre, in the heyeste bordure, a Grekissh T, _that signifyeth
  the lyf Contemplatif_. And bi-twixen these two lettres ther weren
  seyn degrees, nobly y-wroght in manere of laddres; by whiche
  degrees men mighten climben fro the nethereste lettre to the           25
  uppereste. Natheles, handes of some men hadde corven that cloth
  by violence and by strengthe; and everiche man of hem hadde
  born awey swiche peces as he mighte geten. And forsothe, this
  forseide woman bar smale bokes in hir right hand, and in hir left
  hand she bar a ceptre.                                                 30

  And whan she say thise poetical Muses aprochen aboute my
  bed, and endytinge wordes to my wepinges, she was a litel
  amoved, and glowede with cruel eyen. 'Who,' quod she, 'hath
  suffred aprochen to this syke man thise comune strompetes of
  swich a place that men clepen the theatre? The whiche nat              35
  only ne asswagen nat hise sorwes with none remedies, but they
  wolden feden and norisshen hem with swete venim. Forsothe,
  thise ben tho that with thornes and prikkinges of talents or
  affecciouns, whiche that ne ben no-thing fructefyinge nor
  profitable, destroyen the corn plentevous of fruites of resoun;        40
  for they holden the hertes of men in usage, but they ne delivere
  nat folk fro maladye. But if ye Muses hadden withdrawen fro
  me, with your flateryes, any uncunninge and unprofitable man, as
  men ben wont to finde comunly amonges the poeple, I wolde
  wene suffre the lasse grevously; for-why, in swiche an unprofitable    45
  man, myn ententes ne weren no-thing endamaged. But ye withdrawen
  me this man, that hath be norisshed in the studies or
  scoles of Eleaticis and of Achademicis _in Grece_. But goth now
  rather awey, ye mermaidenes, whiche that ben swete til it be at
  the laste, and suffreth this man to be cured and heled by myne         50
  Muses,' _that is to seyn, by noteful sciences_.

  And thus this companye of Muses y-blamed casten wrothly the
  chere dounward to the erthe; and, shewinge by reednesse hir
  shame, they passeden sorowfully the threshfold.

  And I, of whom the sighte, plounged in teres, was derked so            55
  that I ne mighte not knowen what that womman was, of so
  imperial auctoritee, I wex al abaisshed and astoned, and caste my
  sighte doun to the erthe, and bigan stille for to abyde what she
  wolde don afterward. Tho com she ner, and sette hir doun up-on
  the uttereste corner of my bed; and she, biholdinge my chere,          60
  that was cast to the erthe, hevy and grevous of wepinge, compleinede,
  with thise wordes that I shal seyen, the perturbacioun
  of my thought.

  be now alderfirst assailed in perils by folk of wikkede maneres?
  Have I nat striven with ful greet stryf, in olde tyme, bifore the

  the same Plato livinge, his maister Socrates deservede victorie of     20
  unrightful deeth in my presence. The heritage of which Socrates--_the
  heritage is to seyn the doctrine of the whiche Socrates in his
  opinioun of Felicitee, that I clepe welefulnesse_--whan that the

  hem to go ravisshe everich man for his part--_that is to seyn,         25

  In whiche _Epicuriens and Stoiciens_, for as moche as ther semede
  some traces or steppes of myn habite, the folye of men, weninge
  tho _Epicuriens and Stoiciens_ my famuleres, perverted (_sc.

  Socrates, ne the tourments of Zeno, for they weren straungeres:
  yit mightestow han knowen the Senecciens and the Canios and            40

PROSE IV.

_Sentisne, inquit, hec._

  'Felestow,' quod she, 'thise thinges, and entren they aught in
  thy corage? Artow lyke an asse to the harpe? Why wepestow,
  why spillestow teres? Yif thou abydest after help of thy leche,
  thee bihoveth discovere thy wounde.'

  Tho I, that hadde gadered strengthe in my corage, answerede             5
  and seide: 'And nedeth it yit,' quod I, 'of rehersinge or of
  amonicioun; and sheweth it nat y-nough by him-self the sharpnesse
  of Fortune, that wexeth wood ayeins me? Ne moeveth it
  nat thee to seen the face or the manere of this place (_i. prisoun_)?
  Is this the librarie whiche that thou haddest chosen for a right       10
  certein sete to thee in myn hous, ther-as thou desputedest ofte
  with me of the sciences of thinges touchinge divinitee and touchinge
  mankinde? Was thanne myn habite swich as it is now?
  Was than my face or my chere swiche as now (_quasi diceret, non_),
  whan I soughte with thee secrets of nature, whan thou enformedest      15
  my maneres and the resoun of alle my lyf to the ensaumple of
  the ordre of hevene? Is nat this the guerdoun that I referre to
  thee, to whom I have be obeisaunt? Certes, thou confermedest,
  by the mouth of Plato, this sentence, _that is to seyn_, that comune
  thinges or comunalitees weren blisful, yif they that hadden studied    20
  al fully to wisdom governeden thilke thinges, or elles yif it so
  bifille that the governoures of comunalitees studieden to geten
  wisdom.

  Thou seidest eek, by the mouth of the same Plato, that it was
  a necessarie cause, wyse men to taken and desire the governaunce       25
  of comune thinges, for that the governements of citees, y-left
  in the handes of felonous tormentours citizenes, ne sholde nat
  bringe in pestilence and destruccioun to gode folk. And therfor
  I, folwinge thilke auctoritee (_sc. Platonis_), desired to putten forth
  in execucioun and in acte of comune administracioun thilke             30
  thinges that I hadde lerned of thee among my secree resting-whyles.
  Thou, and god that putte thee in the thoughtes of wyse
  folk, ben knowinge with me, that no-thing ne broughte me to
  maistrie or dignitee, but the comune studie of alle goodnesse.
  And ther-of comth it that bi-twixen wikked folk and me han ben         35
  grevous discordes, that ne mighten ben relesed by preyeres; for
  this libertee hath the freedom of conscience, that the wratthe of
  more mighty folk hath alwey ben despysed of me for savacioun of
  right.

  How ofte have I resisted and withstonde thilke man that highte         40
  Conigaste, that made alwey assautes ayeins the prospre fortunes of
  pore feble folk? How ofte eek have I put of or cast out him,
  Trigwille, provost of the kinges hous, bothe of the wronges that he
  hadde bigunne to don, and eek fully performed? How ofte have
  I covered and defended by the auctoritee of me, put ayeins perils--    45
  _that is to seyn, put myn auctoritee in peril for_--the wrecched
  pore folk, that the covetyse of straungeres unpunished tourmenteden
  alwey with miseyses and grevaunces out of noumbre? Never man
  ne drow me yit fro right to wronge. Whan I say the fortunes and
  the richesses of the poeple of the provinces ben harmed or             50
  amenused, outher by privee ravynes or by comune tributes or
  cariages, as sory was I as they that suffreden the harm.

  GLOSSA.  _Whan that Theodoric, the king of Gothes, in a dere
  yere, hadde hise gerneres ful of corn, and comaundede that no man
  ne sholde byen no corn til his corn were sold, and that at a grevous   55
  dere prys, Boece withstood that ordinaunce, and over-com it, knowinge
  al this the king him-self._

  TEXTUS. Whan it was in the soure hungry tyme, ther was
  establisshed or cryed grevous and inplitable coempcioun, that men
  sayen wel it sholde greetly turmenten and endamagen al the             60
  province of Campaigne, I took stryf ayeins the provost of the pretorie
  for comune profit. And, the king knowinge of it, I overcom
  it, so that the coempcioun ne was not axed ne took effect.

  [GLOSSA.] _Coempcioun, that is to seyn, comune achat or bying
  to-gidere, that were establisshed up-on the poeple by swiche a manere  65
  imposicioun, as who-so boughte a busshel corn, he moste yeve the king
  the fifte part._

  [TEXTUS.] Paulin, a counseiller of Rome, the richesses of the
  whiche Paulin the houndes of the palays, _that is to seyn, the
      officeres_,
  wolden han devoured by hope and covetise, yit drow I him out of        70
  the Iowes (_sc. faucibus_) of hem that gapeden. And for as moche
  as the peyne of the accusacioun aiuged biforn ne sholde nat
  sodeinly henten ne punisshen wrongfully Albin, a counseiller of
  Rome, I putte me ayeins the hates and indignaciouns of the
  accusor Ciprian. Is it nat thanne y-nough y-seyn, that I have          75
  purchased grete discordes ayeins my-self? But I oughte be the
  more assured ayeins alle othre folk (_s. Romayns_), that for the love
  of rightwisnesse I ne reserved never no-thing to my-self to hem-ward
  of the kinges halle, _sc. officers_, by the whiche I were the more
  siker. But thorugh tho same accusers accusinge, I am condempned.       80
  Of the noumbir of the whiche accusers oon Basilius,
  that whylom was chased out of the kinges service, is now compelled
  in accusinge of my name, for nede of foreine moneye.
  Also Opilion and Gaudencius han accused me, al be it so that the
  Iustice regal hadde whylom demed hem bothe to go in-to exil for        85
  hir trecheryes and fraudes withoute noumbir. To whiche Iugement
  they nolden nat obeye, but defendeden hem by the sikernesse
  of holy houses, _that is to seyn, fledden into seintuaries_; and
  whan this was aperceived to the king, he comaundede, that but
  they voidede the citee of Ravenne by certein day assigned, that        90
  men sholde merken hem on the forheved with an hoot yren and
  chasen hem out of the toune. Now what thing, semeth thee,
  mighte ben lykned to this crueltee? For certes, thilke same day
  was received the accusinge of my name by thilke same accusers.
  What may ben seid her-to? (_quasi diceret, nichil_). Hath my           95
  studie and my cunninge deserved thus; or elles the forseide dampnacioun
  _of me_, made that hem rightful accusers or no? (_quasi
  diceret, non_). Was not Fortune ashamed of this? Certes, al
  hadde nat Fortune ben ashamed that innocence was accused, yit
  oughte she han had shame of the filthe of myne accusours.             100

  But, axestow in somme, of what gilt I am accused, men seyn
  that I wolde save the companye of the senatours. And desirest
  thou to heren in what manere? I am accused that I sholde han
  destourbed the accuser to beren lettres, by whiche he sholde han
  maked the senatoures gilty ayeins the kinges real maiestee. O         105
  maistresse, what demestow of this? Shal I forsake this blame,
  that I ne be no shame to thee? (_quasi diceret, non_). Certes, I have
  wold it, _that is to seyn, the savacioun of the senat_, ne I shal never
  leten to wilne it, and that I confesse and am aknowe; but the
  entente of the accuser to be destourbed shal cese. For shal I         110
  clepe it thanne a felonie or a sinne that I have desired the
  savacioun of the ordre of the senat? (_quasi diceret, dubito quid_).
  And certes yit hadde thilke same senat don by me, thorugh hir
  decrets and hir Iugements, as though it were a sinne or a felonie;
  _that is to seyn, to wilne the savacioun of hem_ (_sc. senatus_). But 115
  folye, that lyeth alwey to him-self, may not chaunge the merite
  of thinges. Ne I trowe nat, by the Iugement of Socrates, that
  it were leveful to me to hyde the sothe, ne assente to lesinges.
  But certes, how so ever it be of this, I putte it to gessen or
  preisen to the Iugement of thee and of wyse folk. Of whiche           120
  thing al the ordinaunce and the sothe, for as moche as folk that
  ben to comen after our dayes shullen knowen it, I have put it
  in scripture and in remembraunce. For touching the lettres falsly
  maked, by whiche lettres I am accused to han hoped the fredom
  of Rome, what aperteneth me to speke ther-of? Of whiche               125
  lettres the fraude hadde ben shewed apertly, yif I hadde had
  libertee for to han used and ben at the confessioun of myne
  accusours, the whiche thing in alle nedes hath greet strengthe.
  For what other fredom may men hopen? Certes, I wolde that
  som other fredom mighte ben hoped. I wolde thanne han                 130
  answered by the wordes of a man that highte Canius; for whan
  he was accused by Gaius Cesar, Germeynes sone, that he
  (_Canius_) was knowinge and consentinge of a coniuracioun
  y-maked ayeins him (_sc. Gaius_), this Canius answerede thus:
  "Yif I hadde wist it, thou haddest nat wist it." In which thing       135
  sorwe hath nat so dulled my wit, that I pleyne only that shrewede
  folk aparailen felonies ayeins vertu; but I wondre greetly how
  that they may performe thinges that they hadde hoped for to
  don. For-why, to wilne shrewednesse, that comth peraventure
  of oure defaute; but it is lyk a monstre and a mervaille, how         140
  that, in the present sighte of god, may ben acheved and performed
  swiche thinges as every felonous man hath conceived in his
  thought ayeins innocents. For which thing oon of thy famileres
  nat unskilfully axed thus: "Yif god is, whennes comen wikkede
  thinges? And yif god ne is, whennes comen gode thinges?"              145
  But al hadde it ben leveful that felonous folk, that now desiren
  the blood and the deeth of alle gode men and eek of alle the
  senat, han wilned to gon destroyen me, whom they han seyen
  alwey batailen and defenden gode men and eek al the senat,
  yit had I nat desserved of the faderes, _that is to seyn, of the      150
  senatoures_, that they sholden wilne my destruccioun.

  Thou remembrest wel, as I gesse, that whan I wolde doon or
  seyen any thing, thou thyself, alwey present, rewledest me. At
  the city of Verone, whan that the king, gredy of comune slaughter,
  caste him to transporten up al the ordre of the senat the gilt of     155
  his real maiestee, of the whiche gilt that Albin was accused, with
  how gret sikernesse of peril to me defendede I al the senat!
  Thou wost wel that I seye sooth, ne I ne avauntede me never
  in preysinge of my-self. For alwey, whan any wight receiveth
  precious renoun in avauntinge him-self of his werkes, he amenuseth    160
  the secree of his conscience. But now thou mayst wel seen to
  what ende I am comen for myne innocence; I receive peyne
  of fals felonye for guerdon of verray vertu. And what open
  confessioun of felonye hadde ever Iuges so acordaunt in crueltee,
  _that is to seyn, as myn accusinge hath_, that either errour of
      mannes                                                            165
  wit or elles condicioun of Fortune, that is uncertein to alle mortal
  folk, ne submittede some of hem, _that is to seyn, that it ne enclynede
  som Iuge to han pitee or compassioun_? For al-thogh I hadde ben
  accused that I wolde brenne holy houses, and strangle preestes
  with wikkede swerde, or that I hadde greythed deeth to al gode        170
  men, algates the sentence sholde han punisshed me, present,
  confessed, or convict. But now I am remewed fro the citee _of
  Rome_ almost fyve hundred thousand pas, I am with-oute defence
  dampned to proscripcioun and to the deeth, for the studie and
  bountees that I have doon to the senat. But O, wel ben they           175
  worthy of merite (_as who seith, nay_), ther mighte never yit non
  of hem be convict of swiche a blame as myne is! Of whiche
  trespas, myne accusours sayen ful wel the dignitee; the whiche
  dignitee, for they wolden derken it with medeling of som felonye,
  they baren me on hand, and lyeden, that I hadde polut and             180
  defouled my conscience with sacrilege, for coveitise of dignitee.
  And certes, thou thy-self, that are plaunted in me, chacedest
  out of the sege of my corage al coveitise of mortal thinges; ne
  sacrilege hadde no leve to han a place in me biforn thyne eyen.
  For thou droppedest every day in myne eres and in my thought          185
  thilke comaundement of Pictagoras, _that is to seyn_, men shal
  serve to godde, _and not to goddes_. Ne it was nat convenient,
  _ne no nede_, to taken help of the foulest spirites; I, that thou
  hast ordeined and set in swiche excellence that thou makedest
  me lyk to god. And over this, the right clene secree chaumbre         190
  of myne hous, _that is to seyn, my wyf_, and the companye of
  myn honest freendes, and my wyves fader, as wel holy as worthy
  to ben reverenced thorugh his owne dedes, defenden me from
  alle suspecioun of swich blame. But O malice! For they that
  accusen me taken of thee, _Philosophie_, feith of so gret blame!      195
  For they trowen that I have had affinitee to malefice _or enchauntement_,
  by-cause that I am replenisshed and fulfilled with thy
  techinges, and enformed of thy maneres. And thus it suffiseth
  not only, that thy reverence ne availe me not, but-yif that thou,
  of thy free wille, rather be blemished with myn offencioun. But       200
  certes, to the harmes that I have, ther bitydeth yit this
  encrees of harm, that the gessinge and the Iugement of moche
  folk ne looken no-thing to the desertes of thinges, but only
  to the aventure of fortune; and iugen that only swiche thinges
  ben purveyed of god, whiche that temporel welefulnesse commendeth.    205

  GLOSE. _As thus: that, yif a wight have prosperitee, he is a
  good man and worthy to han that prosperitee; and who-so hath
  adversitee, he is a wikked man, and god hath forsake him, and
  he is worthy to han that adversitee. This is the opinioun of some     210
  folk._

  And ther-of comth that good gessinge, first of alle thing, forsaketh
  wrecches: certes, it greveth me to thinke right now the
  dyverse sentences that the poeple seith of me. And thus moche
  I seye, that the laste charge of contrarious fortune is this: that,   215
  whan that any blame is leyd upon a caitif, men wenen that he
  hath deserved that he suffreth. And I, that am put awey fro
  gode men, and despoiled of dignitees, and defouled of my name
  by gessinge, have suffred torment for my gode dedes. Certes,
  me semeth that I see the felonous covines of wikked men               220
  habounden in Ioye and in gladnesse. And I see that every
  lorel shapeth him to finde out newe fraudes for to accuse gode
  folk. And I see that gode men beth overthrowen for drede
  of my peril; and every luxurious tourmentour dar doon alle
  felonye unpunisshed and ben excited therto by yiftes; and             225
  innocents ne ben not only despoiled of sikernesse but of defence;
  and therfore me list to cryen _to god_ in this wyse:--

METRE V.

_O stelliferi conditor orbis._

  O thou maker of the whele that bereth the sterres, which that
  art y-fastned to thy perdurable chayer, and tornest the hevene
  with a ravisshing sweigh, and constreinest the sterres to suffren
  thy lawe; so that the mone som-tyme shyning with hir ful hornes,
  meting with alle the bemes of the sonne hir brother, hydeth the         5
  sterres that ben lesse; and somtyme, whan the mone, pale with
  hir derke hornes, approcheth the sonne, leseth hir lightes; and
  that the eve-sterre Hesperus, whiche that in the firste tyme of
  the night bringeth forth hir colde arysinges, cometh eft ayein
  hir used cours, and is pale _by the morwe_ at the rysing of the        10
  sonne, and is thanne cleped Lucifer. Thou restreinest the day
  by shorter dwelling, in the tyme of colde winter that maketh
  the leves to falle. Thou dividest the swifte tydes of the night,
  whan the hote somer is comen. Thy might atempreth the
  variaunts sesons of the yere; so that Zephirus the deboneir            15
  wind bringeth ayein, _in the first somer sesoun_, the leves that
  the wind that highte Boreas hath reft awey _in autumpne, that
  is to seyn, in the laste ende of somer_; and the sedes that the
  sterre that highte Arcturus saw, ben waxen heye cornes whan the
  sterre Sirius eschaufeth hem. Ther nis no-thing unbounde from          20
  his olde lawe, ne forleteth the werke of his propre estat.

  O thou governour, governinge alle thinges by certein ende, why
  refusestow only to governe the werkes of men by dewe manere?
  Why suffrest thou that slydinge fortune torneth so grete entrechaunginges
  of thinges, so that anoyous peyne, that sholde dewely                  25
  punisshe felouns, punissheth innocents? And folk of wikkede
  maneres sitten in heye chayres, and anoyinge folk treden, and

PROSE V.

_Hic ubi continuato dolore delatraui._

  Whan I hadde, with a continuel sorwe, sobbed or borken out
  thise thinges, she with hir chere pesible, and no-thing amoeved
  with my compleintes, seide thus: 'Whan I say thee,' quod she,
  'sorweful and wepinge, I wiste anon that thou were a wrecche
  and exiled; but I wiste never how fer thyne exile was, yif thy          5
  tale ne hadde shewed it to me. But certes, al be thou fer fro thy
  contree, thou nart nat put out of it; but thou hast failed of thy
  weye and gon amis. And yif thou hast lever for to wene that
  thou be put out of thy contree, than hast thou put out thy-self
  rather than any other wight hath. For no wight but thy-self ne         10
  mighte never han don that to thee. For yif thou remembre of
  what contree thou art born, it nis nat governed by emperours, ne
  by governement of multitude, as weren the contrees of hem of
  Athenes; but oo lord and oo king, _and that is god, that is lord of
  thy contree_, whiche that reioyseth him of the dwelling of hise        15
  citezenes, and nat for to putte hem in exil; of the whiche lorde
  it is a soverayne fredom to be governed by the brydel of him and
  obeye to his Iustice. Hastow foryeten thilke right olde lawe of thy
  citee, in the whiche citee it is ordeined and establisshed, that for
  what wight that hath lever founden ther-in his sete or his hous than   20
  elles-wher, he may nat be exiled by no right from that place? For
  who-so that is contened in-with the palis and the clos of thilke citee,
  ther nis no drede that he may deserve to ben exiled. But who-so
  that leteth the wil for to enhabite there, he forleteth also to deserve
  to ben citezein of thilke citee. So that I sey, that the face of this  25
  place ne moveth me nat so mochel as thyne owne face. Ne I
  axe nat rather the walles of thy librarie, aparayled and wrought
  with yvory and with glas, than after the sete of thy thought. In
  whiche I putte nat whylom bokes, but I putte that that maketh
  bokes worthy of prys or precious, that is to seyn, the sentence of     30
  my bokes. And certeinly of thy desertes, bistowed in comune
  good, thou hast seid sooth, but after the multitude of thy gode
  dedes, thou hast seid fewe; and of the honestee or of the falsnesse
  of thinges that ben aposed ayeins thee, thou hast remembred
  thinges that ben knowen to alle folk. And of the felonyes and          35
  fraudes of thyne accusours, it semeth thee have y-touched it forsothe
  rightfully and shortly, al mighten tho same thinges betere
  and more plentivousely ben couth in the mouthe of the poeple
  that knoweth al this.

  Thou hast eek blamed gretly and compleined of the wrongful             40
  dede of the senat. And thou hast sorwed for my blame, and thou
  hast wopen for the damage of thy renoun that is apayred; and thy
  laste sorwe eschaufede ayeins fortune, and compleinest that guerdouns
  ne ben nat evenliche yolden to the desertes of folk. And
  in the latere ende of thy wode Muse, thou preyedest that thilke        45
  pees that governeth the hevene sholde governe the erthe. But
  for that manye tribulaciouns of affecciouns han assailed thee, and
  sorwe and ire and wepinge to-drawen thee dyversely; as thou art
  now feble of thought, mightier remedies ne shullen nat yit touchen
  thee, for whiche we wol usen somdel lighter medicines: so that         50
  thilke passiouns that ben woxen harde in swellinge, by perturbaciouns
  flowing in-to thy thought, mowen wexen esy and softe,
  to receiven the strengthe of a more mighty and more egre
  medicine, by an esier touchinge.

PROSE VI.

_Primum igitur paterisne me pauculis rogacionibus._

  First woltow suffre me to touche and assaye the estat of thy
  thought by a fewe demaundes, so that I may understonde what
  be the manere of thy curacioun?'

  'Axe me,' quod I, 'at thy wille, what thou wolt, and I shal
  answere.'                                                               5

  Tho seide she thus: 'Whether wenestow,' quod she, 'that
  this world be governed by foolish happes and fortunous, or
  elles that ther be in it any governement of resoun?'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'I ne trowe nat in no manere, that so
  certein thinges sholde be moeved by fortunous fortune; but I           10
  wot wel that god, maker and mayster, is governour of his werk.
  Ne never nas yit day that mighte putte me out of the sothnesse
  of that sentence.'

  'So is it,' quod she; 'for the same thing songe thou a litel
  her-biforn, and biweyledest and biweptest, that only men weren         15
  put out of the cure of god. For of alle other thinges thou
  ne doutedest nat that they nere governed by resoun. But owh!
  (_i. pape!_) I wondre gretly, certes, why that thou art syk, sin
  that thou art put in so holsom a sentence. But lat us seken
  depper; I coniecte that ther lakketh I not nere what. But              20
  sey me this: sin that thou ne doutest nat that this world be
  governed by god, with whiche governailes takestow hede that
  it is governed?'

  'Unnethe,' quod I, 'knowe I the sentence of thy questioun;
  so that I ne may nat yit answeren to thy demaundes.'                   25

  'I nas nat deceived,' quod she, 'that ther ne faileth somwhat,
  by whiche the maladye of thy perturbacioun is crept into
  thy thought, so as the strengthe of the palis chyning is open.
  But sey me this: remembrest thou what is the ende of thinges,
  and whider that the entencioun of alle kinde tendeth?'                 30

  'I have herd it told som-tyme,' quod I; 'but drerinesse hath
  dulled my memorie.'

  'Certes,' quod she, 'thou wost wel whennes that alle thinges
  ben comen and procedeth?'

  'I wot wel,' quod I, and answerede, that 'god is beginning             35
  of al.'

  'And how may this be,' quod she, 'that, sin thou knowest
  the beginning of thinges, that thou ne knowest nat what is the
  ende of thinges? But swiche ben the customes of perturbaciouns,
  and this power they han, that they may moeve a                         40
  man out of his place, _that is to seyn, fro the stablenes and perfeccioun
  of his knowinge_; but, certes, they may nat al arace
  him, ne aliene him in al. But I wolde that thou woldest
  answere to this: remembrestow that thou art a man?'

  'Why sholde I nat remembre that?' quod I.                              45

  'Maystow nat telle me thanne,' quod she, 'what thing is a man?'

  'Axestow me nat,' quod I, 'whether that I be a resonable
  mortal beest? I woot wel, and I confesse wel that I am it.'

  'Wistestow never yit that thou were any other thing?' quod
  she.                                                                   50

  'No,' quod I.

  'Now woot I,' quod she, 'other cause of thy maladye, and
  that right grete. Thou hast left for to knowen thy-self, what
  thou art; thorugh whiche I have pleynly founden the cause of
  thy maladye, or elles the entree of recoveringe of thyn hele.          55
  For-why, for thou art confounded with foryeting of thy-self, for-thy
  sorwestow that thou art exiled of thy propre goodes. And
  for thou ne wost what is the ende of thinges, for-thy demestow
  that felonous and wikked men ben mighty and weleful. And
  for thou hast foryeten by whiche governements the world is             60
  governed, for-thy wenestow that thise mutaciouns of fortune
  fleten with-oute governour. Thise ben grete causes not only
  to maladye, but, certes, grete causes to deeth. But I thanke
  the auctor and the maker of hele, that nature hath not al
  forleten thee. I have grete norisshinges of thyn hele, and that        65
  is, the sothe sentence of governaunce of the worlde; that thou
  bilevest that the governinge of it nis nat subiect ne underput
  to the folie of thise happes aventurous, but to the resoun of
  god. And ther-for doute thee no-thing; for of this litel spark
  thyn hete of lyf shal shyne.                                           70

  But for as moche as it is nat tyme yit of faster remedies, and
  the nature of thoughtes deceived is this, that as ofte as they
  casten awey sothe opiniouns, they clothen hem in false opiniouns,
  of which false opiniouns the derkenesse of perturbacioun wexeth
  up, that confoundeth the verray insighte: and that derkenesse          75
  shal I assaye som-what to maken thinne and wayk by lighte
  and meneliche remedies; so that, after that the derkenesse of
  deceivinge desiringes is don awey, thou mowe knowe the shyninge
  of verray light.

PROSE I.

_Postea paulisper conticuit._

  After this she stinte a litel; and, after that she hadde gadered
  by atempre stillenesse myn attencioun, she seide thus: (_As who
  mighte seyn thus: After thise thinges she stinte a litel; and whan
  she aperceived by atempre stillenesse that I was ententif to herkene
  hir, she bigan to speke in this wyse_): 'Yif I,' quod she, 'have        5
  understonden and knowen outrely the causes and the habit of
  thy maladye, thou languissest and art defeted for desyr and
  talent of thy rather fortune. She, that ilke Fortune only, that
  is chaunged, as thou feynest, to thee-ward, hath perverted the
  cleernesse and the estat of thy corage. I understonde the              10
  fele-folde colours and deceites of thilke merveilous monstre
  Fortune, and how she useth ful flateringe familaritee with hem
  that she enforceth to bigyle; so longe, til that she confounde
  with unsufferable sorwe hem that she hath left in despeyr unpurveyed.
  And yif thou remembrest wel the kinde, the maneres,                    15
  and the desert of thilke Fortune, thou shalt wel knowe that,
  as in hir, thou never ne haddest ne hast y-lost any fair thing.
  But, as I trowe, I shal nat gretly travailen to do thee remembren
  on thise thinges. For thou were wont to hurtelen and despysen
  hir, with manly wordes, whan she was blaundissinge and present,        20
  and pursewedest hir with sentences that were drawen out of myn
  entree, _that is to seyn, out of myn informacioun_. But no sodein
  mutacioun ne bitydeth nat with-oute a manere chaunginge of
  corages; and so is it befallen that thou art a litel departed
  fro the pees of thy thought.                                           25

  But now is tyme that thou drinke and ataste some softe and
  delitable thinges; so that, whan they ben entred with-in thee,
  it mowe maken wey to strengere drinkes of medicynes. Com
  now forth therfore the suasioun of swetenesse rethorien, whiche
  that goth only the right wey, whyl she forsaketh nat myne estatuts.    30
  And with Rhetorice com forth Musice, a damisel of our hous,
  that singeth now lighter moedes _or prolaciouns_, now hevyer.
  What eyleth thee, man? What is it that hath cast thee in-to
  morninge and in-to wepinge? I trowe that thou hast seyn
  som newe thing and uncouth. Thou wenest that Fortune be                35
  chaunged ayein thee; but thou wenest wrong, yif thou that
  wene. Alwey tho ben hir maneres; she hath rather kept, as
  to thee-ward, hir propre stablenesse in the chaunginge of hir-self.
  Right swich was she whan she flatered thee, and deceived               40
  thee with unleveful lykinges of fals welefulnesse. Thou
  hast now knowen and ataynt the doutous or double visage of
  thilke blinde goddesse Fortune. She, that yit covereth hir and
  wimpleth hir to other folk, hath shewed hir every-del to thee.
  Yif thou aprovest hir and thenkest that she is good, use hir
  maneres and pleyne thee nat. And yif thou agrysest hir false           45
  trecherye, despyse and cast awey hir that pleyeth so harmfully;
  for she, that is now cause of so muche sorwe to thee, sholde
  ben cause to thee of pees and of Ioye. She hath forsaken
  thee, forsothe; the whiche that never man may ben siker that
  she ne shal forsake him.                                               50

  GLOSE. _But natheles, some bokes han the text thus_: For sothe,
  she hath forsaken thee, ne ther nis no man siker that she ne
  hath nat forsaken.

  Holdestow than thilke welefulnesse precious to thee that shal
  passen? And is present Fortune dereworthe to thee, which that          55
  nis nat feithful for to dwelle; and, whan she goth awey, that
  she bringeth a wight in sorwe? For sin she may nat ben withholden

_Vellem autem pauca tecum._

  Certes, I wolde pleten with thee a fewe thinges, usinge the
  wordes of Fortune; tak hede now thy-self, yif that she axeth
  right. "O thou man, wher-fore makest thou me gilty by thyne
  every-dayes pleyninges? What wrong have I don thee? What
  goodes have I bireft thee that weren thyne? Stryf or plete              5
  with me, bifore what Iuge that thou wolt, of the possessioun
  of richesses or of dignitees. And yif thou mayst shewen me
  that ever any mortal man hath received any of tho thinges to
  ben hise in propre, than wol I graunte frely that alle thilke
  thinges weren thyne whiche that thou axest. Whan that nature           10
  broughte thee forth out of thy moder wombe, I receyved thee
  naked and nedy of alle thinges, and I norisshede thee with my
  richesses, and was redy and ententif through my favour to
  susteyne thee; and that maketh thee now inpacient ayeins me;
  and I envirounde thee with alle the aboundance and shyninge            15
  of alle goodes that ben in my right. Now it lyketh me to
  with-drawen my hand; thou hast had grace as he that hath
  used of foreine goodes: thou hast no right to pleyne thee, as
  though thou haddest outrely for-lorn alle thy thinges. Why
  pleynest thou thanne? I have done thee no wrong. Richesses,            20
  honours, and swiche other thinges ben of my right. My servauntes
  knowen me for hir lady; they comen with me, and departen
  whan I wende. I dar wel affermen hardily, that yif tho thinges,
  of which thou pleynest that thou hast forlorn, hadde ben thyne,
  thou ne haddest not lorn hem. Shal I thanne only ben defended          25
  to usen my right?

  Certes, it is leveful to the hevene to make clere dayes, and,
  after that, to coveren tho same dayes with derke nightes. The
  yeer hath eek leve to apparailen the visage of the erthe, now
  with floures and now with fruit, and to confounden hem som-tyme        30
  with reynes and with coldes. The see hath eek his right
  to ben som-tyme calme and blaundishing with smothe water,
  and som-tyme to ben horrible with wawes and with tempestes.
  But the covetise of men, that may nat ben stanched, shal it
  binde me to ben stedefast, sin that stedefastnesse is uncouth          35
  to my maneres? Swich is my strengthe, and this pley I pleye
  continuely. I torne the whirlinge wheel with the torning cercle;
  I am glad to chaungen the lowest to the heyest, and the heyest
  to the lowest. Worth up, if thou wolt, so it be by this lawe,
  that thou ne holde nat that I do thee wronge thogh thou                40
  descende adoun, whan the resoun of my pley axeth it.

  Wistest thou nat how Cresus, the king of Lydiens, of whiche
  king Cyrus was ful sore agast a litel biforn, that this rewliche
  Cresus was caught of Cyrus and lad to the fyr to ben brent,
  but that a rayn descendede doun fro hevene that rescowede              45
  him? And is it out of thy minde how that Paulus, consul of
  Rome, whan he hadde taken the king of Perciens, weep pitously
  for the captivitee of the self kinge? What other thing biwailen

  with an unwar stroke overtorneth realmes of grete nobley?              50
  GLOSE. _Tragedie is to seyn, a ditee of a prosperitee for a tyme,

  Lernedest nat thou _in Greke_, whan thou were yonge, that

_Hiis igitur si pro se tecum Fortuna loqueretur._

  Therfor, yif that Fortune spake with thee for hir-self in this
  manere, for-sothe thou ne haddest nat what thou mightest answere.
  And, if thou hast any-thing wherwith, thou mayest rightfully defenden
  thy compleint, it behoveth thee to shewen it; and I wol
  yeven thee space to tellen it.'                                         5

  'Certeynly,' quod I thanne, 'thise beth faire thinges, and
  enointed with hony swetenesse of rethorike and musike; and
  only whyl they ben herd they ben delicious. But to wrecches is
  a depper felinge of harm; _this is to seyn, that wrecches felen the
  harmes that they suffren more grevously than the remedies or the       10
  delites of thise wordes mowen gladen or comforten hem_; so that,
  whan thise thinges stinten for to soune in eres, the sorwe that is
  inset greveth the thought.'

  'Right so is it,' quod she. 'For thise ne ben yit none remedies
  of thy maladye; but they ben a maner norisshinges of thy sorwe,        15
  yit rebel ayein thy curacioun.  For whan that tyme is, I shal
  moeve swiche thinges that percen hem-self depe. But natheles,
  that thou shalt not wilne to leten thy-self a wrecche, hast thou
  foryeten the noumber and the manere of thy welefulnesse? I
  holde me stille, how that the soverayne men of the citee token         20
  thee in cure and kepinge, whan thou were orphelin of fader and
  moder, and were chosen in affinitee of princes of the citee; and
  thou bigunne rather to be leef and dere than forto ben a neighbour;
  the whiche thing is the most precious kinde of any propinquitee
  or alyaunce that may ben. Who is it that ne seide tho                  25
  that thou were right weleful, with so grete a nobleye of thy
      fadres-in-lawe,
  and with the chastitee of thy wyf, and with the oportunitee
  and noblesse of thy masculin children, _that is to seyn, thy sones_?
  And over al this--me list to passen the comune thinges--how
  thou haddest in thy youthe dignitees that weren werned to olde         30
  men. But it delyteth me to comen now to the singuler uphepinge
  of thy welefulnesse. Yif any fruit of mortal thinges may han any
  weighte or prys of welefulnesse, mightest thou ever foryeten, for
  any charge of harm that mighte bifalle, the remembraunce of
  thilke day that thou saye thy two sones maked conseileres, and         35
  y-lad to-gedere fro thyn house under so greet assemblee of
  senatoures and under the blythenesse of poeple; and whan thou
  saye hem set in the court in here chayeres of dignitees? Thou,
  rethorien or pronouncere of kinges preysinges, deservedest glorie
  of wit and of eloquence, whan thou, sittinge bitwene thy two sones,    40
  conseileres, in the place that highte Circo, fulfuldest the abydinge
  of the multitude of poeple that was sprad abouten thee, with so large
  preysinge and laude, as men singen in victories. Tho yave thou
  wordes to Fortune, as I trowe, _that is to seyn, tho feffedest thou
  Fortune with glosinge wordes and deceivedest hir_, whan she acoyede    45
  thee and norisshede thee as hir owne delyces. Thou bere away of
  Fortune a yifte, _that is to seyn, swiche guerdoun_, that she never yaf
  to privee man. Wilt thou therfor leye a rekeninge with Fortune?
  She hath now twinkled first upon thee with a wikkede eye. Yif
  thou considere the noumbre and the manere of thy blisses and           50
  of thy sorwes, thou mayst nat forsaken that thou art yit blisful.
  For if thou therfor wenest thy-self nat weleful, for thinges that

  al maat and overcomen by wepinge and sorwe for desyr of thee,
  in the whiche thing only I moot graunten that thy welefulnesse is      30
  amenused. What shal I seyn eek of thy two sones, conseilours,
  of whiche, as of children of hir age, ther shyneth the lyknesse of
  the wit of hir fader or of hir elder fader? And sin the sovereyn
  cure of alle mortel folk is to saven hir owen lyves, O how weleful
  art thou, yif thou knowe thy goodes! For yit ben ther                  35
  thinges dwelled to thee-ward, that no man douteth that they ne
  ben more dereworthe to thee than thyn owen lyf. And for-thy
  drye thy teres, for yit nis nat everich fortune al hateful to thee-ward,
  ne over greet tempest hath nat yit fallen upon thee, whan
  that thyn ancres cleven faste, that neither wolen suffren the          40
  counfort of this tyme present ne the hope of tyme cominge to
  passen ne to faylen.'

  'And I preye,' quod I, 'that faste moten they halden; for
  whyles that they halden, how-so-ever that thinges ben, I shal wel
  fleten forth and escapen; but thou mayst wel seen how grete            45
  aparayles and aray that me lakketh, that ben passed away fro
  me.'

  'I have som-what avaunsed and forthered thee,' quod she, 'yif
  that thou anoye nat or forthinke nat of al thy fortune: _as who
  seith, I have som-what comforted thee, so that thou tempest thee nat   50
  thus with al thy fortune, sin thou hast yit thy beste thinges_. But
  I may nat suffren thy delices, that pleynest so wepinge and
  anguissous, for that ther lakketh som-what to thy welefulnesse.
  For what man is so sad or of so parfit welefulnesse, that he ne
  stryveth and pleyneth on som halve ayen the qualitee of his            55
  estat? For-why ful anguissous thing is the condicioun of mannes
  goodes; for either it cometh nat al-togider to a wight, or elles it
  last nat perpetuel. For sum man hath grete richesses, but he is
  ashamed of his ungentel linage; and som is renowned of noblesse
  of kinrede, but he is enclosed in so grete anguisshe of nede           60
  of thinges, that him were lever that he were unknowe. And
  som man haboundeth both in richesse and noblesse, but yit he
  bewaileth his chaste lyf, for he ne hath no wyf. And som man is
  wel and selily y-maried, but he hath no children, and norissheth
  his richesses to the eyres of strange folkes. And som man is           65
  gladed with children, but he wepeth ful sory for the trespas of
  his sone or of his doughter. And for this ther ne acordeth no
  wight lightly to the condicioun of his fortune; for alwey to every
  man ther is in som-what that, unassayed, he ne wot nat; or elles
  he dredeth that he hath assayed. And adde this also, that every        70
  weleful man hath a ful delicat felinge; so that, but-yif alle thinges
  bifalle at his owne wil, for he is impacient, or is nat used to han
  non adversitee, anon he is throwen adoun for every litel thing.
  And ful litel thinges ben tho that withdrawen the somme or the
  perfeccioun of blisfulnesse fro hem that ben most fortunat. How        75
  many men, trowest thou, wolden demen hem-self to ben almost in
  hevene, yif they mighten atayne to the leest party of the remnaunt
  of thy fortune? This same place that thou clepest exil, is
  contree to hem that enhabiten heer, and forthy nothing [is]
  wrecched but whan thou wenest it: _as who seith, thou thy-self, ne     80
  no wight elles, nis a wrecche, but whan he weneth him-self a wrecche
  by reputacioun of his corage_. And ayeinward, alle fortune is blisful
  to a man by the agreabletee or by the egalitee of him that
  suffreth it.

  What man is that, that is so weleful, that nolde changen his           85
  estat whan he hath lost pacience? The swetnesse of mannes
  welefulnesse is sprayned with many biternesses; the whiche welefulnesse,
  al-though it seme swete and ioyful to hem that useth it,
  yit may it nat ben with-holden that it ne goth away whan it wole.
  Thanne is it wel sene, how wrecched is the blisfulnesse of mortal      90
  thinges, that neither it dureth perpetuel with hem that every
  fortune receiven agreablely or egaly, ne it delyteth nat in al to
  hem that ben anguissous. O ye mortal folk, what seke ye thanne
  blisfulnesse out of your-self, whiche that is put in your-self?
  Errour and folye confoundeth yow.                                      95

  I shal shewe thee shortely the poynt of sovereyne blisfulnesse.
  Is ther any-thing more precious to thee than thy-self? Thou
  wolt answere, "nay." Thanne, yif it so be that thou art mighty
  over thy-self, _that is to seyn, by tranquillitee of thy sowle_, than
      hast
  thou thing in thy power that thou noldest never lesen, ne Fortune     100
  ne may nat beneme it thee. And that thou mayst knowe that
  blisfulnesse ne may nat standen in thinges that ben fortunous
  and temporel, now understonde and gader it to-gidere thus:
  Yif blisfulnesse be the sovereyn good of nature that liveth by
  resoun, ne thilke thing nis nat sovereyn good that may be taken       105
  awey in any wyse, (for more worthy thing and more digne is
  thilke thing that may nat ben taken awey); than sheweth it wel,
  that the unstablenesse of fortune may nat atayne to receiven
  verray blisfulnesse. And yit more-over: what man that this
  toumbling welefulnesse ledeth, either he woot that it is chaungeable, 110
  or elles he woot it nat. And yif he woot it nat, what blisful
  fortune may ther be in the blindnesse of ignorance? And yif he
  woot that it is chaungeable, he moot alwey ben adrad that he ne
  lese that thing that he ne doubteth nat but that he may lesen it;
  _as who seith, he mot ben alwey agast, lest he lese that he wot wel
      he                                                                115
  may lese it_. For which, the continuel dreed that he hath ne
  suffreth him nat to ben weleful. Or yif he lese it, he weneth to
  be dispysed and forleten. Certes eek, that is a ful litel good that
  is born with evene herte whan it is lost; _that is to seyn, that men
  do no more fors of the lost than of the havinge_. And for as moche    120
  as thou thy-self art he, to whom it hath ben shewed and proved
  by ful manye demonstraciouns, as I wot wel, that the sowles of
  men ne mowe nat deyen in no wyse; and eek sin it is cleer and
  certein, that fortunous welefulnesse endeth by the deeth of the
  body; it may nat ben douted that, yif that deeth may take awey        125
  blisfulnesse, that alle the kinde of mortal thinges ne descendeth
  in-to wrecchednesse by the ende of the deeth. And sin we knowen
  wel, that many a man hath sought the fruit of blisfulnesse nat
  only with suffringe of deeth, but eek with suffringe of peynes and
  tormentes; how mighte than this present lyf maken men blisful,        130
  sin that, whan thilke selve lyf is ended, it ne maketh folk no
  wrecches?

PROSE V.

_Set cum rationum iam in te._

  But for as moche as the norisshinges of my resouns descenden
  now in-to thee, I trowe it were tyme to usen a litel strenger
  medicynes. Now understond heer, al were it so that the yiftes of
  Fortune ne were nat brutel ne transitorie, what is ther in hem
  that may be thyn in any tyme, or elles that it nis foul, yif that it    5
  be considered and loked perfitly? Richesses, ben they precious
  by the nature of hem-self, or elles by the nature of thee? What is
  most worth of richesses? Is it nat gold or might of moneye
  assembled? Certes, thilke gold and thilke moneye shyneth and
  yeveth betere renoun to hem that despenden it thanne to thilke         10
  folk that mokeren it; for avarice maketh alwey mokereres to ben
  hated, and largesse maketh folk cleer of renoun. For sin that
  swich thing as is transferred fram o man to another ne may nat
  dwellen with no man; certes, thanne is thilke moneye precious
  whan it is translated into other folk and stenteth to ben had, by      15
  usage of large yevinge _of him that hath yeven it_. And also: yif
  that al the moneye that is over-al in the worlde were gadered
  toward o man, it sholde maken alle other men to ben nedy as of that.
  And certes a voys al hool, _that is to seyn, with-oute amenusinge_,
  fulfilleth to-gidere the hering of moche folk; but certes, youre       20
  richesses ne mowen nat passen in-to moche folke with-oute
  amenusinge. And whan they ben apassed, nedes they maken
  hem pore that for-gon the richesses.

  O! streite and nedy clepe I this richesse, sin that many folk
  ne may nat han it al, ne al may it nat comen to o man with-outen       25
  povertee of alle other folk! And the shyninge of gemmes, _that
  I clepe precious stones_, draweth it nat the eyen of folk to hem-ward,
  _that is to seyn, for the beautee_? But certes, yif ther were
  beautee or bountee in the shyninge of stones, thilke cleernesse is
  of the stones hem-self, and nat of men; for whiche I wondre            30
  gretly that men mervailen on swiche thinges. For-why, what
  thing is it, that yif it wanteth moeving and Ioynture of sowle and
  body, that by right mighte semen a fair creature to him that hath
  a sowle of resoun? For al be it so that gemmes drawen to hem-self
  a litel of the laste beautee of the world, through the entente of      35
  hir creatour and through the distinccioun of hem-self; yit, for as
  mochel as they ben put under youre excellence, they ne han nat
  deserved by no wey that ye sholden mervailen on hem. And
  the beautee of feldes, delyteth it nat mochel un-to yow?'

  _Boece._ 'Why sholde it nat delyten us, sin that it is a right fair    40
  porcioun of the right faire werke, _that is to seyn, of this world_?
  And right so ben we gladed som-tyme of the face of the see
  whan it is cleer; and also mervailen we on the hevene and on the
  sterres, and on the sonne and on the mone.'

  _Philosophye._ 'Aperteneth,' quod she, 'any of thilke thinges to       45
  thee? Why darst thou glorifyen thee in the shyninge of any
  swiche thinges? Art thou distingwed and embelised by the
  springinge floures of the first somer sesoun, or swelleth thy
  plentee in the fruites of somer? Why art thou ravisshed with
  ydel Ioyes? Why embracest thou straunge goodes as they weren           50
  thyne? Fortune ne shal never maken that swiche thinges ben
  thyne, that nature of thinges hath maked foreine fro thee. Sooth
  is that, with-outen doute, the frutes of the erthe owen to ben to
  the norissinge of bestes. And yif thou wolt fulfille thy nede after
  that it suffyseth to nature, than is it no nede that thou seke after   55
  the superfluitee of fortune. For with ful fewe things and with ful
  litel thinges nature halt hir apayed; and yif thou wolt achoken
  the fulfillinge of nature with superfluitees, certes, thilke thinges
  that thou wolt thresten or pouren in-to nature shullen ben unioyful
  to thee, or elles anoyous. Wenest thou eek that it be a fair           60
  thing to shyne with dyverse clothinge? Of whiche clothinge yif
  the beautee be agreeable to loken up-on, I wol mervailen on the
  nature of the matere of thilke clothes, or elles on the werkman
  that wroughte hem. But also a long route of meynee, maketh
  that a blisful man? The whiche servants, yif they ben vicious of       65
  condiciouns, it is a great charge and a distruccioun to the hous,
  and a greet enemy to the lord him-self. And yif they ben goode
  men, how shal straunge or foreine goodnesse ben put in the
  noumbre of thy richesse? So that, by all these forseide thinges,
  it is clearly y-shewed, that never oon of thilke thinges that thou     70
  acountedest for thyne goodes nas nat thy good. In the whiche
  thinges, yif ther be no beautee to ben desyred, why sholdest thou
  ben sory yif thou lese hem, or why sholdest thou reioysen thee
  to holden hem? For yif they ben faire of hir owne kinde, what
  aperteneth that to thee? For al so wel sholden they han ben            75
  faire by hem-selve, though they weren departed fram alle thyne
  richesses. Forwhy faire ne precious ne weren they nat, for that
  they comen among thy richesses; but, for they semeden faire and
  precious, ther-for thou haddest lever rekne hem amonges thy
  richesses.                                                             80

  But what desirest thou of Fortune with so grete a noise, and
  with so grete a fare? I trowe thou seke to dryve awey nede with
  habundaunce of thinges; but certes, it torneth to you al in the
  contrarie. Forwhy certes, it nedeth of ful manye helpinges to
  kepen the diversitee of precious ostelments. And sooth it is,          85
  that of manye thinges han they nede that manye thinges han; and
  ayeinward, of litel nedeth hem that mesuren hir fille after the nede
  of kinde, and nat after the outrage of coveityse. Is it thanne so,
  that ye men ne han no proper good y-set in you, for which
  ye moten seken outward youre goodes in foreine and subgit              90
  thinges? So is thanne the condicioun of thinges torned up-so-down,
  that a man, that is a devyne beest by merite of his resoun,
  thinketh that him-self nis neither faire ne noble, but-yif it be
  thorugh possessioun of ostelments that ne han no sowles. And
  certes, al other thinges ben apayed of hir owne beautee; but ye        95
  men, that ben semblable to god by your resonable thought,
  desiren to aparailen your excellent kinde of the lowest thinges;
  ne ye understonden nat how greet a wrong ye don to your
  creatour. For he wolde that mankinde were most worthy and
  noble of any othre erthely thinges; and ye threste adoun your         100
  dignitees benethe the lowest thinges. For yif that al the good of
  every thinge be more precious than is thilke thing whos that
  the good is: sin ye demen that the fouleste thinges ben youre
  goodes, thanne submitten ye and putten your-selven under tho
  fouleste thinges by your estimacioun; and certes, this tydeth nat     105
  with-oute youre desertes. For certes, swiche is the condicioun of
  alle mankinde, that only whan it hath knowinge of it-selve, than
  passeth it in noblesse alle other thinges; and whan it forleteth the
  knowinge of it-self, than is it brought binethen alle beestes. For-why
  al other livinge beestes han of kinde to knowe nat hem-self;          110
  but whan that men leten the knowinge of hemself, it cometh hem
  of vice. But how brode sheweth the errour and the folye of yow
  men, that wenen that any thing may ben aparailed with straunge
  aparailements! But for sothe that may nat ben doon. For yif
  a wight shyneth with thinges that ben put to him, _as thus, if        115
  thilke thinges shynen with which a man is aparailed_, certes, thilke
  thinges ben comended and preysed with which he is aparailed;
  but natheles, the thing that is covered and wrapped under that
  dwelleth in his filthe.

  And I denye that thilke thing be good that anoyeth him that           120
  hath it. Gabbe I of this?. Thou wolt seye "nay." Certes,
  richesses han anoyed ful ofte hem that han tho richesses; sin that
  every wikked shrewe, (and for his wikkednesse the more gredy
  after other folkes richesses, wher-so ever it be in any place, be it
  gold or precious stones), weneth him only most worthy that hath       125
  hem. Thou thanne, that so bisy dredest now the swerd and now
  the spere, yif thou haddest entred in the path of this lyf a voide
  wayferinge man, than woldest thou singe beforn the theef; _as
  who seith, a pore man, that berth no richesse on him by the weye,
  may boldely singe biforn theves, for he hath nat wherof to ben        130
  robbed_. O precious and right cleer is the blisfulnesse of mortal
  richesses, that, whan thou hast geten it, than hast thou lorn thy
  sikernesse!

PROSE VI.

_Quid autem de dignitatibus._

  But what shal I seye of dignitees and of powers, the whiche
  ye men, that neither knowen verray dignitee ne verray power,
  areysen hem as heye as the hevene? The whiche dignitees and
  powers, yif they comen to any wikked man, they don as grete
  damages and destrucciouns as doth the flaumbe of the mountaigne         5
  Ethna, whan the flaumbe walweth up; ne no deluge ne doth so
  cruel harmes. Certes, thee remembreth wel, as I trowe, that
  thilke dignitee that men clepen the imperie of consulers, the
  whiche that whylom was biginninge of fredom, youre eldres
  coveiteden to han don away that dignitee, for the pryde of the         10
  consulers. And right for the same pryde your eldres, biforn that
  tyme, hadden don awey, out of the citee of Rome, the kinges
  name; _that is to seyn, they nolde han no lenger no king_. But
  now, yif so be that dignitees and powers be yeven to goode men,
  the whiche thing is ful selde, what agreable thing is ther in tho      15
  dignitees or powers but only the goodnesse of folkes that usen
  hem? And therfor it is thus, that honour ne comth nat to vertu
  for cause of dignitee, but ayeinward honour comth to dignitee for
  cause of vertu. But whiche is thilke youre dereworthe power,
  that is so cleer and so requerable? O ye ertheliche bestes,            20
  considere ye nat over which thinge that it semeth that ye han
  power? Now yif thou saye a mous amonges other mys, that
  chalaunged to him-self-ward right and power over alle other mys,
  how greet scorn woldest thou han of it! GLOSA. _So fareth it by
  men; the body hath power over the body._ For yif thou loke wel         25
  up-on the body of a wight, what thing shall thou finde more
  freele than is mankinde; the whiche men wel ofte ben slayn with
  bytinge of smale flyes, or elles with the entringe of crepinge
  wormes in-to the privetees of mannes body? But wher shal man
  finden any man that may exercen or haunten any right up-on             30
  another man, but only up-on his body, or elles up-on thinges
  that ben lowere than the body, the whiche I clepe fortunous
  possessiouns? Mayst thou ever have any comaundement over
  a free corage? Mayst thou remuen fro the estat of his propre
  reste a thought that is clyvinge to-gidere in him-self by stedefast    35
  resoun? As whylom a tyraunt wende to confounde a free man
  of corage, and wende to constreyne him by torment, to maken
  him discoveren and acusen folk that wisten of a coniuracioun,
  _which I clepe a confederacie_, that was cast ayeins this tyraunt;
  but this free man boot of his owne tonge and caste it in the           40
  visage of thilke wode tyraunt; so that the torments that this
  tyraunt wende to han maked matere of crueltee, this wyse man
  maked it matere of vertu.

  But what thing is it that a man may don to another man, that
  he ne may receyven the same thing of othre folk in him-self:           45
  _or thus, what may a man don to folk, that folk ne may don him the
  same?_ I have herd told of Busirides, that was wont to sleen his
  gestes that herberweden in his hous; and he was sleyn him-self
  of Ercules that was his gest. Regulus hadde taken in bataile
  many men of Affrike and cast hem in-to feteres; but sone after         50
  he moste yeve his handes to ben bounde with the cheynes of
  hem that he hadde whylom overcomen. Wenest thou thanne
  that he be mighty, that hath no power to don a thing, that othre
  ne may don in him that he doth in othre? And yit more-over,
  yif it so were that thise dignitees or poweres hadden any propre       55
  or natural goodnesse in hem-self, never nolden they comen to
  shrewes. For contrarious thinges ne ben nat wont to ben
  y-felawshiped to-gidere. Nature refuseth that contrarious thinges
  ben y-ioigned. And so, as I am in certein that right wikked folk
  han dignitees ofte tyme, than sheweth it wel that dignitees and        60
  powers ne ben nat goode of hir owne kinde; sin that they suffren
  hem-self to cleven or ioinen hem to shrewes. And certes, the
  same thing may I most digneliche iugen and seyn of alle the
  yiftes of fortune that most plentevously comen to shrewes; of
  the whiche yiftes, I trowe that it oughte ben considered, that no      65
  man douteth that he nis strong in whom he seeth strengthe; and
  in whom that swiftnesse is, sooth it is that he is swift. Also
  musike maketh musiciens, and phisike maketh phisiciens, and
  rethorike rethoriens. For-why the nature of every thing maketh
  his propretee, ne it is nat entremedled with the effects of the        70
  contrarious thinges; and, as of wil, it chaseth out thinges that
  ben to it contrarie. But certes, richesse may not restreyne
  avarice unstaunched; ne power ne maketh nat a man mighty
  over him-self, whiche that vicious lustes holden destreyned with
  cheynes that ne mowen nat be unbounden. And dignitees that             75
  ben yeven to shrewede folk nat only ne maketh hem nat digne,
  but it sheweth rather al openly that they ben unworthy and
  undigne. And why is it thus? Certes, for ye han Ioye to clepen
  thinges with false names that beren hem alle in the contrarie;
  the whiche names ben ful ofte reproeved by the effecte of the          80
  same thinges; so that thise ilke richesses ne oughten nat by
  right to ben cleped richesses; ne swich power ne oughte nat
  ben cleped power; ne swich dignitee ne oughte nat ben cleped
  dignitee.

  And at the laste, I may conclude the same thing of alle the            85
  yiftes of Fortune, in which ther nis nothing to ben desired, ne
  that hath in him-self naturel bountee, as it is ful wel y-sene. For
  neither they ne ioignen hem nat alwey to goode men, ne maken
  hem alwey goode to whom that they ben y-ioigned.

_Nouimus quantas dederit ruinas._

  We han wel knowen how many grete harmes and destrucciouns
  weren don _by the emperor Nero_. He leet brenne the citee of
  Rome, and made sleen the senatoures. And he, cruel, whylom
  slew his brother; and he was maked moist with the blood of
  his moder; _that is to seyn, he leet sleen and slitten the body of      5
  his moder, to seen wher he was conceived_; and he loked on every
  halve up-on her colde dede body, ne no tere ne wette his face, but
  _he was so hard-herted that_ he mighte ben domes-man or Iuge of
  hir dede beautee. And natheles, yit governede this _Nero_ by
  ceptre alle the poeples that Phebus the sonne may seen, cominge        10
  from his outereste arysinge til he hyde his bemes under the
  wawes; _that is to seyn, he governed alle the poeples by ceptre imperial
  that the sonne goth aboute, from est to west_. And eek _this
  Nero governed by ceptre_ alle the poeples that ben under the
  colde sterres that highten "septem triones"; _this is to seyn, he      15
  governede alle the poeples that ben under the party of the north_.
  And eek _Nero governed_ alle the poeples that the violent wind
  Nothus scorkleth, and baketh the brenning sandes by his drye
  hete; _that is to seyn, alle the poeples in the south_. But yit ne
  mighte nat al his hye power torne the woodnesse of this wikked         20

PROSE VII.

_Tum ego, scis, inquam._

  Thanne seyde I thus: 'Thou wost wel thy-self that the coveitise
  of mortal thinges ne hadde never lordshipe of me; but
  I have wel desired matere of thinges to done, _as who seith, I
  desire to han matere of governaunce over comunalitees_, for vertu,
  stille, ne sholde nat elden;' _that is to seyn, that [him] leste that,  5
  or he wex olde, his vertu, that lay now ful stille, ne should nat
  perisshe unexercised in governaunce of comune; for which men
  mighten speken or wryten of his goode governement_.

  _Philosophye._ 'For sothe,' quod she, 'and that is a thing that
  may drawen to governaunce swiche hertes as ben worthy and              10
  noble of hir nature; but natheles, it may nat drawen or tollen
  swiche hertes as ben y-brought to the fulle perfeccioun of vertu,
  that is to seyn, coveitise of glorie and renoun to han wel administred
  the comune thinges or don gode desertes to profit of the
  comune. For see now and considere, how litel and how voide of          15
  alle prys is thilke glorie. Certein thing is, as thou hast lerned by
  the demonstracioun of astronomye, that al the environinge of the
  erthe aboute ne halt nat but the resoun of a prikke at regard of the
  greetnesse of hevene; that is to seyn, that yif ther were maked
  comparisoun of the erthe to the greetnesse of hevene, men wolden       20
  iugen in al, that the erthe ne helde no space. Of the whiche litel
  regioun of this worlde, the ferthe partye is enhabited with livinge
  bestes that we knowen, as thou thyself hast y-lerned by Tholomee
  that proveth it. And yif thou haddest with-drawen and abated in
  thy thought fro thilke ferthe partye as moche space as the see and     25
  the mareys contenen and over-goon, and as moche space as the
  regioun of droughte over-streccheth, _that is to seyn, sandes and
  desertes_, wel unnethe sholde ther dwellen a right streit place to
  the habitacioun of men. And ye thanne, that ben environed and
  closed with-in the leste prikke of thilke prikke, thinken ye to        30
  manifesten your renoun and don youre name to ben born forth?
  But your glorie, that is so narwe and so streite y-throngen in-to so
  litel boundes, how mochel coveiteth it in largesse and in greet
  doinge? And also sette this there-to: that many a nacioun,
  dyverse of tonge and of maneres and eek of resoun of hir livinge,      35
  ben enhabited in the clos of thilke litel habitacle; to the whiche
  naciouns, what for difficultee of weyes and what for dyversitee of
  langages, and what for defaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of
  marchaundise, nat only the names of singuler men ne may nat
  strecchen, but eek the fame of citees ne may nat strecchen. At         40
  the laste, certes, in the tyme of Marcus Tullius, as him-self writ in
  his book, that the renoun of the comune of Rome ne hadde nat
  yit passed ne cloumben over the mountaigne that highte Caucasus;
  and yit was, thilke tyme, Rome wel waxen and greetly redouted of
  the Parthes and eek of other folk enhabitinge aboute. Seestow          45
  nat thanne how streit and how compressed is thilke glorie that ye
  travailen aboute to shewe and to multiplye? May thanne the
  glorie of a singuler Romaine strecchen thider as the fame of the
  name of Rome may nat climben ne passen? And eek, seestow nat
  that the maneres of dyverse folk and eek hir lawes ben discordaunt     50
  among hem-self; so that thilke thing that som men
  iugen worthy of preysinge, other folk iugen that it is worthy of
  torment? And ther-of comth it that, though a man delyte him in
  preysinge of his renoun, he may nat in no wyse bringen forth ne
  spreden his name to many maner poeples. There-for every man            55
  oughte to ben apayed of his glorie that is publisshed among his
  owne neighbours; and thilke noble renoun shal ben restreyned
  within the boundes of o manere folke. But how many a man,
  that was ful noble in his tyme, hath the wrecched and nedy
  foryetinge of wryteres put out of minde and don awey! Al be            60
  it so that, certes, thilke wrytinges profiten litel; the whiche
  wrytinges long and derk elde doth awey, bothe hem and eek hir
  autours. But ye men semen to geten yow a perdurabletee, whan
  ye thenken that, in tyme to-cominge, your fame shal lasten. But
  natheles, yif thou wolt maken comparisoun to the endeles spaces        65
  of eternitee, what thing hast thou by whiche thou mayst reioysen
  thee of long lastinge of thy name? For yif ther were maked comparisoun
  of the abydinge of a moment to ten thousand winter,
  for as mochel as bothe the spaces ben ended, yit hath the
  moment som porcioun of it, al-though it litel be. But natheles,        70
  thilke selve noumbre of yeres, and eek as many yeres as
  ther-to may be multiplyed, ne may nat, certes, ben comparisoned
  to the perdurabletee that is endeles; for of thinges that han ende
  may be maked comparisoun, but of thinges that ben with-outen
  ende, to thinges that han ende, may be maked no comparisoun.           75
  And forthy is it that, al-though renoun, of as long tyme as ever
  thee list to thinken, were thought to the regard of eternitee, that
  is unstaunchable and infinit, it ne sholde nat only semen litel, but
  pleynliche right naught. But ye men, certes, ne conne don
  nothing a-right, but-yif it be for the audience of poeple and for      80
  ydel rumours; and ye forsaken the grete worthinesse of conscience
  and of vertu, and ye seken your guerdouns of the smale wordes of
  straunge folk.

  Have now heer and understonde, in the lightnesse of swich
  pryde and veine glorie, how a man scornede festivaly and merily        85
  swich vanitee. Whylom ther was a man that hadde assayed
  with stryvinge wordes another man, the whiche, nat for usage of
  verray vertu but for proud veine glorie, had taken up-on him
  falsly the name of a philosophre. This rather man. _that I spak
  of_ thoughte he wolde assaye, wher he, thilke, were a philosophre      90
  or no; that is to seyn, yif that he wolde han suffred lightly in
  pacience the wronges that weren don un-to him. This feynede
  philosophre took pacience a litel whyle, and, whan he hadde
  received wordes of outrage, he, as in stryvinge ayein and reioysinge
  of him-self, seyde at the laste right thus: "understondest             95
  thou nat that I am a philosophre?" That other man answerde
  ayein ful bytingly, and seyde: "I hadde wel understonden it, yif
  thou haddest holden thy tonge stille." But what is it to thise
  noble worthy men (for, certes, of swiche folke speke I) that seken
  glorie with vertu? What is it?' quod she; 'what atteyneth fame        100
  to swiche folk, whan the body is resolved by the deeth at the
  laste? For yif it so be that men dyen in al, _that is to seyn, body
  and sowle_, the whiche thing our resoun defendeth us to bileven,
  thanne is ther no glorie in no wyse. _For what sholde thilke glorie
  ben_, whan he, of whom thilke glorie is seyd to be, nis right naught  105
  in no wyse? And yif the sowle, whiche that hath in it-self science
  of goode werkes, unbounden fro the prison of the erthe, wendeth
  frely to the hevene, despyseth it nat thanne alle erthely occupacioun;
  and, being in hevene, reioyseth that it is exempt fro alle
  erthely thinges? _As who seith, thanne rekketh the sowle of no        110

_Set ne me inexorabile contra fortunam._

  'But for as mochel as thou shalt nat wenen', quod she, 'that I
  bere untretable bataile ayeins fortune, yit som-tyme it bifalleth that
  she, deceyvable, deserveth to han right good thank of men; and
  that is, whan she hir-self opneth, and whan she descovereth hir
  frount, and sheweth hir maneres. Peraventure yit understondest          5
  thou nat that I shal seye. It is a wonder that I desire to telle,
  and forthy unnethe may I unpleyten my sentence with wordes; for
  I deme that contrarious Fortune profiteth more to men than
  Fortune debonaire. For alwey, whan Fortune semeth debonaire,
  than she lyeth falsly in bihetinge the hope of welefulnesse; but       10
  forsothe contrarious Fortune is alwey soothfast, whan she sheweth
  hir-self unstable thorugh hir chaunginge. The amiable Fortune
  deceyveth folk; the contrarie Fortune techeth. The amiable
  Fortune bindeth with the beautee of false goodes the hertes of
  folk that usen hem; the contrarie Fortune unbindeth hem by the         15
  knowinge of freele welefulnesse. The amiable Fortune mayst
  thou seen alwey windinge and flowinge, and ever misknowinge of
  hir-self; the contrarie Fortune is atempre and restreyned, and wys
  thorugh exercise of hir adversitee. At the laste, amiable Fortune
  with hir flateringes draweth miswandringe men fro the sovereyne        20
  good; the contrarious Fortune ledeth ofte folk ayein to soothfast
  goodes, and haleth hem ayein as with an hooke. Wenest thou
  thanne that thou oughtest to leten this a litel thing, that this aspre
  and horrible Fortune hath discovered to thee the thoughtes of thy
  trewe freendes? For-why this ilke Fortune hath departed and uncovered  25
  to thee bothe the certein visages and eek the doutous
  visages of thy felawes. Whan she departed awey fro thee, she
  took awey hir freendes, and lafte thee thyne freendes. Now whan
  thou were riche and weleful, as thee semede, with how mochel
  woldest thou han bought the fulle knowinge of this, _that is to seyn,  30
  the knowinge of thy verray freendes_? Now pleyne thee nat thanne
  of richesse y-lorn, sin thou hast founden the moste precious kinde
  of richesses, that is to seyn, thy verray freendes.

_Iam cantum illa finierat._

  By this she hadde ended hir song, whan the sweetnesse of hir
  ditee hadde thorugh-perced me that was desirous of herkninge,
  and I astoned hadde yit streighte myn eres, _that is to seyn, to
  herkne the bet what she wolde seye_; so that a litel here-after I
  seyde thus: 'O thou that art sovereyn comfort of anguissous             5
  corages, so thou hast remounted and norisshed me with the
  weighte of thy sentences and with delyt of thy singinge; so that
  I trowe nat now that I be unparigal to the strokes of Fortune:

  wel defende me fro hir_. And tho remedies whiche that thou             10
  seydest her-biforn weren right sharpe, nat only that I am nat
  a-grisen of hem now, but I, desirous of heringe, axe gretely to
  heren the remedies.'

  Than seyde she thus: 'That felede I ful wel,' quod she, 'whan
  that thou, ententif and stille, ravisshedest my wordes; and I          15
  abood til that thou haddest swich habite of thy thought as thou

  'That wole I gladly don,' quod she, 'for the cause of thee;

PROSE II.

_Tunc defixo paullulum uisu._

  Tho fastnede she a litel the sighte of hir eyen, and with-drow
  hir right as it were in-to the streite sete of hir thought; and bigan
  to speke right thus: 'Alle the cures,' quod she, 'of mortal folk,
  whiche that travaylen hem in many maner studies, goon certes by
  diverse weyes, but natheles they enforcen hem alle to comen only        5
  to oon ende of blisfulnesse. And blisfulnesse is swiche a good,
  that who-so that hath geten it, he ne may, over that, no-thing
  more desyre. And this thing is forsothe the sovereyn good that
  conteyneth in him-self alle maner goodes; to the whiche good yif
  ther failede any thing, it mighte nat ben cleped sovereyn good:        10
  for thanne were ther som good, out of this ilke sovereyn good, that
  mighte ben desired. Now is it cleer and certein thanne, that
  blisfulnesse is a parfit estat by the congregacioun of alle goodes;
  the whiche blisfulnesse, as I have seyd, alle mortal folk enforcen
  hem to geten by diverse weyes. For-why the coveitise of verray         15
  good is naturelly y-plaunted in the hertes of men; but the miswandringe
  errour mis-ledeth hem in-to false goodes. Of the
  whiche men, som of hem wenen that sovereyn good be to liven
  with-oute nede of any thing, and travaylen hem to be haboundaunt
  of richesses. And som other men demen that sovereyn good be,           20
  for to ben right digne of reverence; and enforcen hem to ben
  reverenced among hir neighbours by the honours that they han
  y-geten. And some folk ther ben that holden, that right heigh
  power be sovereyn good, and enforcen hem for to regnen, or elles
  to ioignen hem to hem that regnen. And it semeth to some other         25
  folk, that noblesse of renoun be the sovereyn good; and hasten
  hem to geten glorious name by the arts of werre and of pees.
  And many folk mesuren and gessen that sovereyn good be Ioye
  and gladnesse, and wenen that it be right blisful thing to ploungen
  hem in voluptuous delyt. And ther ben folk that entrechaungen          30
  the causes and the endes of thise forseyde goodes, as they that
  desiren richesses to han power and delytes; or elles they desiren
  power for to han moneye, or for cause of renoun. In thise thinges,
  and in swiche othre thinges, is torned alle the entencioun of
  desiringes and of werkes of men; as thus: noblesse and favour          35
  of people, whiche that yeveth to men, as it semeth hem, a maner
  cleernesse of renoun; and wyf and children, that men desiren for
  cause of delyt and of merinesse. But forsothe, frendes ne sholden
  nat be rekned a-mong the godes of fortune, but of vertu; for it is
  a ful holy maner thing. Alle thise othre thinges, forsothe, ben        40
  taken for cause of power or elles for cause of delyt.

  Certes, now am I redy to referren the goodes of the body to
  thise forseide thinges aboven; for it semeth that strengthe and
  gretnesse of body yeven power and worthinesse, and that beautee
  and swiftnesse yeven noblesses and glorie of renoun; and hele of       45
  body semeth yeven delyt. In alle thise thinges it semeth only
  that blisfulnesse is desired. For-why thilke thing that every man
  desireth most over alle thinges, he demeth that it be the sovereyn
  good; but I have defyned that blisfulnesse is the sovereyn good;
  for which every wight demeth, that thilke estat that he desireth       50
  over alle thinges, that it be blisfulnesse.

  Now hast thou thanne biforn thyn eyen almest al the purposed
  forme of the welefulnesse of man-kinde, that is to seyn, richesses,
  honours, power, and glorie, and delyts. The whiche delyt only
  considerede Epicurus, and iuged and establisshed that delyt is         55
  the sovereyn good; for as moche as alle othre thinges, as him
  thoughte, bi-refte awey Ioye and mirthe fram the herte. But I
  retorne ayein to the studies of men, of whiche men the corage
  alwey reherseth and seketh the sovereyn good, al be it so that
  it be with a derked memorie; but he not by whiche path, right          60
  as a dronken man not nat by whiche path he may retorne him to
  his hous. Semeth it thanne that folk folyen and erren that
  enforcen hem to have nede of nothing? Certes, ther nis non other
  thing that may so wel performe blisfulnesse, as an estat plentivous
  of alle goodes, that ne hath nede of non other thing, but that is      65
  suffisaunt of himself unto him-self. And folyen swiche folk thanne,
  that wenen that thilke thing that is right good, that it be eek right
  worthy of honour and of reverence? Certes, nay. For that thing
  nis neither foul ne worthy to ben despised, that wel neigh al the
  entencioun of mortal folk travaylen for to geten it. And power,        70
  oughte nat that eek to ben rekened amonges goodes? What
  elles? For it is nat to wene that thilke thing, that is most worthy
  of alle thinges, be feble and with-oute strengthe. And cleernesse
  of renoun, oughte that to ben despised? Certes, ther may no
  man forsake, that al thing that is right excellent and noble, that it
      ne                                                                 75
  semeth to ben right cleer and renomed. For certes, it nedeth nat
  to seye, that blisfulnesse be [nat] anguissous ne drery, ne subgit to
  grevaunces ne to sorwes, sin that in right litel thinges folk seken
  to have and to usen that may delyten hem. Certes, thise ben
  the thinges that men wolen and desiren to geten. And for this          80
  cause desiren they richesses, dignitees, regnes, glorie, and delices.
  For therby wenen they to han suffisaunce, honour, power, renoun,
  and gladnesse. Than is it good, that men seken thus by so many
  diverse studies. In whiche desyr it may lightly ben shewed how
  gret is the strengthe of nature; for how so that men han diverse       85
  sentences and discordinge, algates men acorden alle in lovinge the
  ende of good.

_Vos quoque, o terrena animalia._

  Certes also ye men, that ben ertheliche beestes, dremen alwey
  youre beginninge, al-though it be with a thinne imaginacioun;
  and by a maner thoughte, al be it nat cleerly ne parfitly, ye loken
  fram a-fer to thilke verray fyn of blisfulnesse; and ther-fore naturel
  entencioun ledeth you to thilke verray good, but many maner             5
  errours mis-torneth you ther-fro. Consider now yif that by thilke

  that he may comen to thilke ende that he weneth to come by
  nature. For yif that moneye or honours, or thise other forseyde
  thinges bringen to men swich a thing that no good ne fayle hem         10
  ne semeth fayle, certes than wole I graunte that they ben maked

  thilke thinges ne mowen nat performen that they bi-heten, and
  that ther be defaute of manye goodes, sheweth it nat thanne
  cleerly that fals beautee of blisfulnesse is knowen and ateint in      15
  thilke thinges? First and forward thou thy-self, that haddest
  habundaunces of richesses nat long agon, I axe yif that, in the
  habundaunce of alle thilke richesses, thou were never anguissous

  'And was nat that,' quod she, 'for that thee lakked som-what

  'Right so is it,' quod I.

  'Thanne desiredest thou the presence of that oon and the

  'Forsothe,' quod she, 'than nedeth ther som-what that every
  man desireth?'

  'Ye, ther nedeth,' quod I.

  'Certes,' quod she, 'and he that hath lakke or nede of aught
  nis nat in every wey suffisaunt to himself?'                           35

  'No,' quod I.

  'And thou,' quod she, 'in al the plentee of thy richesses haddest
  thilke lakke of suffisaunse?'

  'What elles?' quod I.

  'Thanne may nat richesses maken that a man nis nedy, ne that           40
  he be suffisaunt to him-self; and that was it that they bi-highten,
  as it semeth. And eek certes I trowe, that this be gretly to

  ne may ben bi-nomen of hem that han it, maugre hem?'

  'I bi-knowe it wel,' quod I.                                           45

  'Why sholdest thou nat bi-knowen it,' quod she, 'whan every
  day the strenger folk bi-nemen it fro the febler, maugre hem?
  For whennes comen elles alle thise foreyne compleyntes or
  quereles of pletinges, but for that men axen ayein here moneye
  that hath ben bi-nomen hem by force or by gyle, and alwey              50

  'Right so is it,' quod I.

  'Than,' quod she, 'hath a man nede to seken him foreyne

  'Who may sey nay?' quod I.                                             55

  'Certes,' quod she; 'and him nedede non help, yif he ne hadde
  no moneye that he mighte lese?'

  'That is douteles,' quod I.

  'Than is this thinge torned in-to the contrarye,' quod she.
  'For richesses, that men wenen sholde make suffisaunce, they           60
  maken a man rather han nede of foreyne help! Which is
  the manere or the gyse,' quod she, 'that richesse may dryve awey
  nede? Riche folk, may they neither han hunger ne thurst?
  Thise riche men, may they fele no cold on hir limes on winter?
  But thou wolt answeren, that riche men han y-now wher-with they        65
  may staunchen hir hunger, slaken hir thurst, and don a-wey cold.
  In this wyse may nede be counforted by richesses; but certes,
  nede ne may nat all outrely ben don a-wey. For though this nede,
  that is alwey gapinge and gredy, be fulfild with richesses, and axe

  holde me stille, and telle nat how that litel thing suffiseth to

_Set dignitates._

  But dignitees, to whom they ben comen, maken they him
  honorable and reverent? Han they nat so gret strengthe, that
  they may putte vertues in the hertes of folk that usen the lordshipes
  of hem? Or elles may they don a-wey the vyces? Certes, they
  ne be nat wont to don awey wikkednesse, but they ben wont               5
  rather to shewen wikkednesse. And ther-of comth it that I have
  right grete desdeyn, that dignitees ben yeven ofte to wikked
  men; for which thing Catullus cleped _a consul of Rome, that
  highte_ Nonius, "postum" or "boch"; _as who seyth, he cleped him
  a congregacioun of vyces in his brest, as a postum is ful of
      corupcioun_,                                                       10
  al were this Nonius set in a chayre of dignitee. Seest thou nat
  thanne how gret vilenye dignitees don to wikked men? Certes,
  unworthinesse of wikked men sholde be the lasse y-sene, yif they
  nere renomed of none honours. Certes, thou thyself ne mightest
  nat ben brought with as manye perils as thou mightest suffren          15
  that thou woldest beren the magistrat with Decorat; _that is to
  seyn, that for no peril that mighte befallen thee by offence of the king
  Theodorike, thou noldest nat be felawe in governaunce with Decorat_;
  whan thou saye that he hadde wikked corage of a likerous shrewe
  and of an accuser. Ne I ne may nat, for swiche honours, iugen          20
  hem worthy of reverence, that I deme and holde unworthy to han
  thilke same honours. Now yif thou saye a man that were fulfild
  of wisdom, certes, thou ne mightest nat deme that he were unworthy
  to the honour, or elles to the wisdom of which he is
  fulfild?'--'No,' quod I.--'Certes, dignitees,' quod she, 'apertienen   25
  proprely to vertu; and vertu transporteth dignitee anon to
  thilke man to which she hir-self is conioigned. And for as moche
  as honours of poeple ne may nat maken folk digne of honour, it
  is wel seyn cleerly that they ne han no propre beautee of dignitee.
  And yit men oughten taken more heed in this. For yif it so be          30
  that a wikked wight be so mochel the foulere and the more out-cast,
  that he is despysed of most folk, so as dignitee ne may nat
  maken shrewes digne of reverence, the which shrewes dignitee
  sheweth to moche folk, thanne maketh dignitee shrewes rather so
  moche more despysed than preysed; and forsothe nat unpunisshed:        35
  _that is for to seyn, that shrewes revengen hem ayeinward
  up-on dignitees_; for they yilden ayein to dignitees as gret guerdoun,
  whan they bi-spotten and defoulen dignitees with hir
  vilenye. And for as mochel as thou mowe knowe that thilke
  verray reverence ne may nat comen by thise shadewy transitorie         40
  dignitees, undirstond now thus: yif that a man hadde used and
  had many maner dignitees of consules, and were comen peraventure
  amonge straunge naciouns, sholde thilke honour maken
  him worshipful and redouted of straunge folk? Certes, yif that
  honour of poeple were a naturel yift to dignitees, it ne mighte        45
  never cesen nowher amonges no maner folk to don his office,
  right as fyr in every contree ne stinteth nat to eschaufen and to
  ben hoot. But for as moche as for to ben holden honourable or
  reverent ne cometh nat to folk of hir propre strengthe of nature,
  but only of the false opinioun of folk, _that is to seyn, that wenen   50
  that dignitees maken folk digne of honour_; anon therfore whan
  that they comen ther-as folk ne knowen nat thilke dignitees, hir
  honours vanisshen awey, and that anon. But that is amonges
  straunge folk, mayst thou seyn; but amonges hem ther they
  weren born, ne duren nat thilke dignitees alwey? Certes, the           55
  dignitee of the provostrie of Rome was whylom a gret power;
  now is it nothing but an ydel name, and the rente of the senatorie
  a gret charge. And yif a wight whylom hadde the office to taken
  hede to the vitailes of the poeple, as of corn and other thinges, he
  was holden amonges grete; but what thing is now more out-cast          60
  thanne thilke provostrie? And, as I have seyd a litel her-biforn,
  that thilke thing that hath no propre beautee of him-self receiveth
  som-tyme prys and shyninge, and som-tyme leseth it by the
  opinioun of usaunces. Now yif that dignitees thanne ne mowen
  nat maken folk digne of reverence, and yif that dignitees wexen        65
  foule of hir wille by the filthe of shrewes, and yif that dignitees
  lesen hir shyninge by chaunginge of tymes, and yif they wexen
  foule by estimacioun of poeple: what is it that they han in hem-self
  of beautee that oughte ben desired? _as who seyth, non_;
  thanne ne mowen they yeven no beautee of dignitee to non other.        70

_An vero regna regumque familiaritas._

  But regnes and familiaritees of kinges, may they maken a
  man to ben mighty? How elles, whan hir blisfulnesse dureth
  perpetuely? But certes, the olde age of tyme passed, and eek
  of present tyme now, is ful of ensaumples how that kinges ben
  chaunged in-to wrecchednesse out of hir welefulnesse. O! a              5
  noble thing and a cleer thing is power, that is nat founden
  mighty to kepen it-self! And yif that power of reaumes be
  auctour and maker of blisfulnesse, yif thilke power lakketh on
  any syde, amenuseth it nat thilke blisfulnesse and bringeth in
  wrecchednesse? But yit, al be it so that the reaumes of mankinde       10
  strecchen brode, yit mot ther nede ben moche folk, over
  whiche that every king ne hath no lordshipe ne comaundement.
  And certes, up-on thilke syde that power faileth, which that
  maketh folk blisful, right on that same syde noun-power entreth
  under-nethe, that maketh hem wrecches; in this manere thanne           15
  moten kinges han more porcioun of wrecchednesse than of
  welefulnesse. A tyraunt, _that was king of Sisile_, that hadde
  assayed the peril of his estat, shewede by similitude the dredes
  of reaumes by gastnesse of a swerd that heng over the heved
  _of his familier_. What thing is thanne this power, that may nat       20
  don awey the bytinges of bisinesse, ne eschewe the prikkes of
  drede? And certes, yit wolden they liven in sikernesse, but
  they may nat; and yit they glorifye hem in hir power. Holdest
  thou thanne that thilke man be mighty, that thou seest that
  he wolde don that he may nat don? And holdest thou thanne              25
  him a mighty man, that hath envirownede his sydes with men
  of armes or seriaunts, and dredeth more hem that he maketh
  agast than they dreden him, and that is put in the handes of
  his servaunts for he sholde seme mighty?  But of familieres
  or servaunts of kinges what sholde I telle thee anything, sin          30
  that I myself have shewed thee that reaumes hem-self ben
  ful of gret feblesse? The whiche familieres, certes, the ryal
  power of kinges, in hool estat and in estat abated, ful ofte
  throweth adown. Nero constreynede Senek, his familier and
  his mayster, to chesen on what deeth he wolde deyen. Antonius          35
  comaundede that knightes slowen with hir swerdes Papinian
  _his familier_, which Papinian hadde ben longe tyme ful mighty
  amonges hem of the court. And yit, certes, they wolden bothe
  han renounced hir power; of whiche two Senek enforcede him
  to yeven to Nero his richesses, and also to han gon in-to              40
  solitarie exil. But whan the grete weighte, _that is to seyn_, of
  _lordes power or of fortune_, draweth hem that shullen falle,
  neither of hem ne mighte do that he wolde. What thing is
  thanne thilke power, that though men han it, yit they ben agast;
  and whanne thou woldest han it, thou nart nat siker; and               45
  yif thou woldest forleten it, thou mayst nat eschuen it? But
  whether swiche men ben frendes at nede, as ben conseyled by
  fortune and nat by vertu? Certes, swiche folk as weleful
  fortune maketh freendes, contrarious fortune maketh hem
  enemys. And what pestilence is more mighty for to anoye a              50
  wight than a familier enemy?

_Gloria uero quam fallax saepe._

  But glorie, how deceivable and how foul is it ofte! For

  glorie," quod he, "thou art nothing elles to thousandes of folkes
  but a greet sweller of eres!" For manye han had ful greet               5
  renoun by the false opinioun of the poeple, and what thing
  may ben thought fouler than swiche preysinge? For thilke folk
  that ben preysed falsly, they moten nedes han shame of hir
  preysinges. And yif that folk han geten hem thonk or preysinge
  by hir desertes, what thing hath thilke prys eched or                  10
  encresed to the conscience of wyse folk, that mesuren hir good,
  nat by the rumour of the poeple, but by the soothfastnesse of
  conscience? And yif it seme a fair thing, a man to han
  encresed and spred his name, than folweth it that it is demed
  to ben a foul thing, yif it ne be y-sprad and encresed. But,           15
  as I seyde a litel her-biforn that, sin ther mot nedes ben many
  folk, to whiche folk the renoun of a man ne may nat comen,
  it befalleth that he, that thou wenest be glorious and renomed,
  semeth in the nexte partie of the erthes to ben with-oute glorie
  and with-oute renoun.                                                  20

  And certes, amonges thise thinges I ne trowe nat that the

  thanne moten they nedes be gentil that ben preysed. For
  which thing it folweth, that yif thou ne have no gentilesse of
  thy-self, _that is to seyn, preyse that comth of thy deserte_, foreine
  gentilesse ne maketh thee nat gentil. But certes, yif ther be

_Nihil igitur dubium est._

  harmes thise forseyde weyes ben enlaced, I shal shewe thee
  shortly. For-why yif thou enforcest thee to asemble moneye,             5
  thou most bireven him his moneye that hath it. And yif
  thou wolt shynen with dignitees, thou most bisechen and

  thorugh humblesse of axinge. Yif thou desirest power, thou             10
  shalt by awaytes of thy subgits anoyously ben cast under manye

  leden thy lyf in delices, every wight shal despisen thee and
  forleten thee, as thou that art thral to thing that is right foul      15
  and brotel; that is to seyn, servaunt to thy body. Now is it
  thanne wel seen, how litel and how brotel possessioun they
  coveiten, that putten the goodes of the body aboven hir owne
  resoun. For mayst thou sormounten thise olifaunts in gretnesse
  or weight of body? Or mayst thou ben stronger than the bole?           20
  Mayst thou ben swifter than the tygre? Bihold the spaces and
  the stablenesse and the swifte cours of the hevene, and stint
  som-tyme to wondren on foule thinges; the which hevene, certes,
  nis nat rather for thise thinges to ben wondred up-on, than for
  the resoun by which it is governed. But the shyning of thy             25
  forme, _that is to seyn, the beautee of thy body_, how swiftly passinge
  is it, and how transitorie; certes, it is more flittinge than the
  mutabilitee of flowers of the somer-sesoun. For so Aristotle
  telleth, that yif that men hadden eyen of a beest that highte

  thinges that with-stonden it, who-so loked thanne in the entrailes
  of the body of Alcibiades, that was ful fayr in the superfice
  with-oute, it shold seme right foul. And forthy, yif thou semest
  fayr, thy nature maketh nat that, but the desceivaunce of the
  feblesse of the eyen that loken. But preyse the goodes of the          35

  that, what-so it be, _that is to seyn, of the goodes of thy body_,
  which that thou wondrest up-on, may ben destroyed or dissolved
  by the hete of a fevere of three dayes. Of alle whiche forseyde

_Eheu! quae miseros tramite deuios._

  Allas! which folye and which ignoraunce misledeth wandringe
  wrecches fro the path of verray goode!

  Certes, ye ne seken no gold in grene trees, ne ye ne gaderen
  nat precious stones in the vynes, ne ye ne hyden nat your

  ye ne gon nat to the fordes of the water that highte Tyrene.
  And over this, men knowen wel the crykes and the cavernes

PROSE IX.

_Hactenus mendacis formam._

  It suffyseth that I have shewed hider-to the forme of false
  welefulnesse, so that, yif thou loke now cleerly, the order of
  myn entencioun requireth from hennes-forth to shewen thee the
  verray welefulnesse.'

  'For sothe,' quod I, 'I see wel now that suffisaunce may nat            5
  comen by richesses, ne power by reames, ne reverence by
  dignitees, ne gentilesse by glorie, ne Ioye by delices.'

  'And hast thou wel knowen the causes,' quod she, 'why it is?'

  'Certes, me semeth,' quod I, 'that I see hem right as though
  it were thorugh a litel clifte; but me were levere knowen hem          10
  more openly of thee.'

  'Certes,' quod she, 'the resoun is al redy. For thilke thing
  that simply is o thing, with-outen any devisioun, the errour
  and folye of mankinde departeth and devydeth it, and misledeth
  it and transporteth from verray and parfit good to goodes that         15
  ben false and unparfit. But sey me this. Wenest thou that
  he, that hath nede of power, that him ne lakketh no-thing?'

  'Nay,' quod I.

  'Certes,' quod she, 'thou seyst a-right. For yif so be that
  ther is a thing, that in any partye be febler of power, certes,        20
  as in that, it mot nedes ben nedy of foreine help.'

  'Right so is it,' quod I.

  'Suffisaunce and power ben thanne of o kinde?'

  'So semeth it,' quod I.

  'And demest thou,' quod she, 'that a thing that is of this             25
  manere, _that is to seyn, suffisaunt and mighty_, oughte ben
  despysed, or elles that it be right digne of reverence aboven
  alle thinges?'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'it nis no doute, that it is right worthy to
  ben reverenced.'                                                       30

  'Lat us,' quod she, 'adden thanne reverence to suffisaunce
  and to power, so that we demen that thise three thinges ben
  al o thing.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'lat us adden it, yif we wolen graunten the
  sothe.'                                                                35

  'What demest thou thanne?' quod she; 'is that a derk thing
  and nat noble, _that is suffisaunt, reverent, and mighty_, or elles that
  it is right noble and right cleer by celebritee of renoun? Consider
  thanne,' quod she, 'as we han graunted her-biforn, that he that
  ne hath nede of no-thing, and is most mighty and most digne            40
  of honour, yif him nedeth any cleernesse of renoun, which
  cleernesse he mighte nat graunten of him-self, so that, for lakke
  of thilke cleernesse, he mighte seme the febeler on any syde
  or the more out-cast?' GLOSE. _This is to seyn, nay; for who-so
  that is suffisaunt, mighty, and reverent, cleernesse of renoun folweth 45
  of the forseyde thinges; he hath it al redy of his suffisaunce._

  _Boece._ 'I may nat,' quod I, 'denye it; but I mot graunte
  as it is, that this thing be right celebrable by cleernesse of renoun
  and noblesse.'

  'Thanne folweth it,' quod she, 'that we adden cleernesse of            50
  renoun to the three forseyde thinges, so that ther ne be amonges
  hem no difference?'

  'This is a consequence,' quod I.

  'This thing thanne,' quod she, 'that ne hath nede of no
  foreine thing, and that may don alle thinges by hise strengthes,       55
  and that is noble and honourable, nis nat that a mery thing
  and a Ioyful?'

  'But whennes,' quod I, 'that any sorwe mighte comen to this
  thing that is swiche, certes, I may nat thinke.'

  'Thanne moten we graunte,' quod she, 'that this thing be               60
  ful of gladnesse, yif the forseyde thinges ben sothe; and certes,
  also mote we graunten that suffisaunce, power, noblesse, reverence,
  and gladnesse ben only dyverse by names, but hir substaunce
  hath no diversitee.'

  'It mot needly been so,' quod I.                                       65

  'Thilke thing thanne,' quod she, 'that is oon and simple
  in his nature, the wikkednesse of men departeth it and devydeth
  it; and whan they enforcen hem to geten partye of a thing
  that ne hath no part, they ne geten hem neither thilke partye that
  nis non, ne the thing al hool that they ne desire nat.'                70

  'In which manere?' quod I.

  'Thilke man,' quod she, 'that secheth richesses to fleen
  povertee, he ne travaileth him nat for to gete power; for he
  hath levere ben derk and vyl; and eek withdraweth from
  him-self many naturel delyts, for he nolde lese the moneye that        75
  he hath assembled. But certes, in this manere he ne geteth
  him nat suffisaunce that power forleteth, and that molestie
  prikketh, and that filthe maketh out-cast, and that derkenesse
  hydeth. And certes, he that desireth only power, he wasteth
  and scatereth richesse, and despyseth delyts, and eek honour           80
  that is with-oute power, ne he ne preyseth glorie no-thing.
  Certes, thus seest thou wel, that manye thinges faylen to him;
  for he hath som-tyme defaute of many necessitees, and many
  anguisshes byten him; and whan he ne may nat don tho defautes
  a-wey, he forleteth to ben mighty, and that is the thing that          85
  he most desireth. And right thus may I maken semblable
  resouns of honours, and of glorie, and of delyts. For so as
  every of thise forseyde thinges is the same that thise other
  thinges ben, _that is to seyn, al oon thing_, who-so that ever
  seketh to geten that oon of thise, and nat that other, he ne           90
  geteth nat that he desireth.'

  _Boece._ 'What seyst thou thanne, yif that a man coveiteth
  to geten alle thise thinges to-gider?'

  _Philosophie._ 'Certes,' quod she, 'I wolde seye, that he wolde
  geten him sovereyn blisfulnesse; but that shal he nat finde in         95
  tho thinges that I have shewed, that ne mowen nat yeven that
  they beheten.'

  'Certes, no,' quod I.

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'ne sholden men nat by no wey seken
  blisfulnesse in swiche thinges as men wene that they ne mowen         100
  yeven but o thing senglely of alle that men seken.'

  'I graunte wel,' quod I; 'ne no sother thing ne may ben
  sayd.'

  'Now hast thou thanne,' quod she, 'the forme and the causes
  of false welefulnesse. Now torne and flitte the eyen of thy           105
  thought; for ther shalt thou sen anon thilke verray blisfulnesse
  that I have bihight thee.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'it is cleer and open, thogh it were to
  a blinde man; and that shewedest thou me ful wel a litel her-biforn,
  whan thou enforcedest thee to shewe me the causes                     110
  of the false blisfulnesse. For but-yif I be bigyled, thanne
  is thilke the verray blisfulnesse parfit, that parfitly maketh a
  man suffisaunt, mighty, honourable, noble, and ful of gladnesse.
  And, for thou shalt wel knowe that I have wel understonden
  thise thinges with-in my herte, I knowe wel that thilke blisfulnesse, 115
  that may verrayly yeven oon of the forseyde thinges, sin
  they ben al oon, I knowe, douteles, that thilke thing is the
  fulle blisfulnesse.'

  _Philosophie._ 'O my norie,' quod she, 'by this opinioun I
  seye that thou art blisful, yif thou putte this ther-to that I        120
  shal seyn.'

  'What is that?' quod I.

  'Trowest thou that ther be any thing in thise erthely mortal
  toumbling thinges that may bringen this estat?'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'I trowe it naught; and thou hast shewed            125
  me wel that over thilke good ther nis no-thing more to ben
  desired.'

  'Thise thinges thanne,' quod she, '_that is to sey, erthely
  suffisaunce and power and swiche thinges_, either they semen
  lykenesses of verray good, or elles it semeth that they yeve to       130
  mortal folk a maner of goodes that ne ben nat parfit; but thilke
  good that is verray and parfit, that may they nat yeven.'

  'I acorde me wel,' quod I.

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'for as mochel as thou hast knowen
  which is thilke verray blisfulnesse, and eek whiche thilke thinges    135
  ben that lyen falsly blisfulnesse, _that is to seyn, that by deceite
  semen verray goodes_, now behoveth thee to knowe whennes and
  where thou mowe seke thilke verray blisfulnesse.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'that desire I greetly, and have abiden longe
  tyme to herknen it.'                                                  140

  'But for as moche,' quod she, 'as it lyketh to my disciple
  Plato, in his book of "in Timeo," that in right litel thinges men
  sholden bisechen the help of god, what iugest thou that be now
  to done, so that we may deserve to finde the sete of thilke
  verray good?'                                                         145

  'Certes,' quod I, 'I deme that we shollen clepen the fader
  of alle goodes; for with-outen him nis ther no-thing founden
  a-right.'

  'Thou seyst a-right,' quod she; and bigan anon to singen
  right thus:--                                                         150

PROSE X.

_Quoniam igitur quae sit imperfecti._

  For as moche thanne as thou hast seyn, which is the forme
  of good that nis nat parfit, and which is the forme of good that
  is parfit, now trowe I that it were good to shewe in what this
  perfeccioun of blisfulnesse is set. And in this thing, I trowe
  that we sholden first enquere for to witen, yif that any swiche         5
  maner good as thilke good that thou has diffinisshed a litel
  heer-biforn, _that is to seyn, soverein good_, may ben founde in the
  nature of thinges; for that veyn imaginacioun of thought ne
  deceyve us nat, and putte us out of the sothfastnesse of thilke
  thing that is summitted unto us. But it may nat ben deneyed            10
  that thilke good ne is, and that it nis right as welle of alle
  goodes. For al thing that is cleped inparfit is proeved inparfit
  by the amenusinge of perfeccioun or of thing that is parfit.
  And ther-of comth it, that in every thing general, yif that men
  sen any-thing that is inparfit, certes, in thilke general ther mot     15
  ben som-thing that is parfit; for yif so be that perfeccioun is
  don awey, men may nat thinke ne seye fro whennes thilke
  thing is that is cleped inparfit. For the nature of thinges ne
  took nat hir beginninge of thinges amenused and inparfit, but
  it procedeth of thinges that ben al hoole and absolut, and             20
  descendeth so doun in-to outterest thinges, and in-to thinges
  empty and with-outen frut. But, as I have y-shewed a litel
  her-biforn, that yif ther be a blisfulnesse that be freele and
  veyn and inparfit, ther may no man doute that ther nis som
  blisfulnesse that is sad, stedefast, and parfit.'                      25

  _Boece._ 'This is concluded,' quod I, 'fermely and sothfastly.'

  _Philosophie._ 'But considere also,' quod she, 'in wham this
  blisfulnesse enhabiteth. The comune acordaunce and conceite
  of the corages of men proeveth and graunteth, that god, prince
  of alle thinges, is good. For, so as nothing ne may ben thought        30
  bettre than god, it may nat ben douted thanne that he, that
  nothing nis bettre, that he nis good. Certes, resoun sheweth
  that god is so good, that it proveth by verray force that parfit
  good is in him. For yif god ne is swich, he ne may nat ben
  prince of alle thinges; for certes som-thing possessing in it-self     35
  parfit good, sholde ben more worthy than god, and it sholde
  semen that thilke thing were first, and elder than god. For
  we han shewed apertly that alle thinges that ben parfit ben
  first or thinges that ben unparfit; and for-thy, for as moche as
  that my resoun or my proces ne go nat a-wey with-oute an               40
  ende, we owen to graunten that the soverein god is right ful
  of soverein parfit good. And we han establisshed that the
  soverein good is verray blisfulnesse: thanne mot it nedes be,
  that verray blisfulnesse is set in soverein god.'

  'This take I wel,' quod I, 'ne this ne may nat ben withseid            45
  in no manere.'

  'But I preye,' quod she, 'see now how thou mayst proeven,
  holily and with-oute corupcioun, this that I have seyd, that the
  soverein god is right ful of soverein good.'

  'In which manere?' quod I.                                             50

  'Wenest thou aught,' quod she, 'that this prince of alle
  thinges have y-take thilke soverein good any-wher out of him-self,
  of which soverein good men proveth that he is ful, right
  as thou mightest thinken that god, that hath blisfulnesse in
  him-self, and thilke blisfulnesse that is in him, weren dyvers in      55
  substaunce? For yif thou wene that god have received thilke
  good out of him-self, thou mayst wene that he that yaf thilke
  good to god be more worthy than is god. But I am bi-knowen
  and confesse, and that right dignely, that god is right worthy
  aboven alle thinges; and, yif so be that this good be in him           60
  by nature, but that it is dyvers fro him by weninge resoun,
  sin we speke of god prince of alle thinges: feigne who-so
  feigne may, who was he that hath conioigned thise dyverse
  thinges to-gider? And eek, at the laste, see wel that a thing
  that is dyvers from any thing, that thilke thing nis nat that          65
  same thing fro which it is understonden to ben dyvers. Thanne
  folweth it, that thilke thing that by his nature is dyvers fro
  soverein good, that that thing nis nat soverein good; but certes,
  that were a felonous corsednesse to thinken that of him that
  nothing nis more worth. For alwey, of alle thinges, the nature         70
  of hem ne may nat ben bettre than his biginning; for which
  I may concluden, by right verray resoun, that thilke that is
  biginning of alle thinges, thilke same thing is soverein good
  in his substaunce.'

  _Boece._ 'Thou hast seyd rightfully,' quod I.                          75

  _Philosophie._ 'But we han graunted,' quod she, 'that the
  soverein good is blisfulnesse.'

  'And that is sooth,' quod I.

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'moten we nedes graunten and confessen
  that thilke same soverein good be god.'                                80

  'Certes,' quod I, 'I ne may nat denye ne withstonde the
  resouns purposed; and I see wel that it folweth by strengthe
  of the premisses.'

  'Loke now,' quod she, 'yif this be proved yit more fermely
  thus: that ther ne mowen nat ben two soverein goodes that              85
  ben dyverse amonge hem-self. For certes, the goodes that
  ben dyverse amonges hem-self, that oon nis nat that that other
  is; thanne ne [may] neither of hem ben parfit, so as either of
  hem lakketh to other. But that that nis nat parfit, men may
  seen apertly that it nis nat soverein. The thinges, thanne, that       90
  ben sovereinly goode, ne mowen by no wey ben dyverse. But
  I have wel concluded that blisfulnesse and god ben the soverein
  good; for whiche it mot nedes ben, that soverein blisfulnesse
  is soverein divinitee.'

  'Nothing,' quod I, 'nis more soothfast than this, ne more              95
  ferme by resoun; ne a more worthy thing than god may nat
  ben concluded.'

  'Up-on thise thinges thanne,' quod she, 'right as thise geometriens,
  whan they han shewed hir proposiciouns, ben wont
  to bringen in thinges that they clepen porismes, _or declaraciouns    100
  of forseide thinges_, right so wole I yeve thee heer as a corollarie,
  _or a mede of coroune_. For-why, for as moche as by the getinge
  of blisfulnesse men ben maked blisful, and blisfulnesse is
  divinitee: thanne is it manifest and open, that by the getinge
  of divinitee men ben maked blisful. Right as by the getinge           105
  of Iustice [they ben maked iust], and by the getinge of sapience
  they ben maked wyse: right so, nedes, by the semblable resoun,
  whan they han geten divinitee, they ben maked goddes. Thanne
  is every blisful man god; but certes, by nature, ther nis but
  o god; but, by the participacioun of divinitee, ther ne let ne        110
  desturbeth nothing that ther ne ben manye goddes.'

  'This is,' quod I, 'a fair thing and a precious, clepe it as
  thou wolt; be it porisme or corollarie,' _or mede of coroune or
  declaringes_.

  'Certes,' quod she, 'nothing nis fayrer than is the thing that        115
  by resoun sholde ben added to thise forseide thinges.'

  'What thing?' quod I.

  'So,' quod she, 'as it semeth that blisfulnesse conteneth many
  thinges, it were for to witen whether that alle thise thinges maken
  or conioignen as a maner body of blisfulnesse, by dyversitee of       120
  parties or of membres; or elles, yif that any of alle thilke thinges
  be swich that it acomplisshe by him-self the substaunce of
  blisfulnesse, so that alle thise othre thinges ben referred and
  brought to blisfulnesse,' _that is to seyn, as to the cheef of hem_.

  'I wolde,' quod I, 'that thou makedest me cleerly to understonde      125
  what thou seyst, and that thou recordedest me the forseyde
  thinges.'

  'Have I nat iuged,' quod she, 'that blisfulnesse is good?'

  'Yis, forsothe,' quod I; 'and that soverein good.'

  'Adde thanne,' quod she, 'thilke good, _that is maked blisfulnesse_,  130
  to alle the forseide thinges; for thilke same blisfulnesse
  that is demed to ben soverein suffisaunce, thilke selve is soverein
  power, soverein reverence, soverein cleernesse _or noblesse_, and
  soverein delyt. CONCLUSIO. What seyst thou thanne of alle thise
  thinges, that is to seyn, suffisaunce, power, and this othre thinges; 135
  ben they thanne as membres of blisfulnesse, or ben they referred
  and brought to soverein good, right as alle thinges that ben brought
  to the chief of hem?'

  'I understonde wel;' quod I, 'what thou purposest to seke;
  but I desire for to herkne that thou shewe it me.'                    140

  'Tak now thus the discrecioun of this questioun,' quod she.
  'Yif alle thise thinges,' quod she, 'weren membres to felicitee,
  than weren they dyverse that oon from that other; and swich is
  the nature of parties or of membres, that dyverse membres compounen
  a body.'                                                              145

  'Certes,' quod I, 'it hath wel ben shewed heer-biforn, that alle
  thise thinges ben alle o thing.'

  'Thanne ben they none membres,' quod she; 'for elles it
  sholde seme that blisfulnesse were conioigned al of on membre
  allone; but that is a thing that may nat be don.'                     150

  'This thing,' quod I, 'nis nat doutous; but I abyde to herknen
  the remnaunt of thy questioun.'

  'This is open and cleer,' quod she, 'that alle othre thinges ben
  referred and brought to good. For therefore is suffisaunce requered,
  for it is demed to ben good; and forthy is power requered,            155
  for men trowen also that it be good; and this same thing mowen
  we thinken and coniecten of reverence, and of noblesse, and of
  delyt. Thanne is soverein good the somme and the cause of al
  that aughte ben desired; for-why thilke thing that with-holdeth
  no good in it-self, ne semblaunce of good, it ne may nat wel in       160
  no manere be desired ne requered. And the contrarie: for
  thogh that thinges by hir nature ne ben nat goode, algates, yif
  men wene that ben goode, yit ben they desired as though that
  they weren verrayliche goode. And therfor is it that men oughten
  to wene by right, that bountee be the soverein fyn, and the cause     165
  of alle the thinges that ben to requeren. But certes, thilke that
  is cause for which men requeren any thing, it semeth that thilke
  same thing be most desired. As thus: yif that a wight wolde
  ryden for cause of hele, he ne desireth nat so mochel the moevinge
  to ryden, as the effect of his hele. Now thanne, sin that             170
  alle thinges ben requered for the grace of good, they ne ben nat
  desired of alle folk more thanne the same good. But we han
  graunted that blisfulnesse is that thing, for whiche that alle thise
  othre thinges ben desired; thanne is it thus: that, certes, only
  blisfulnesse is requered and desired. By whiche thing it sheweth      175
  cleerly, that of good and of blisfulnesse is al oon and the same
  substaunce.'

  'I see nat,' quod I, 'wherfore that men mighten discorden in
  this.'

  'And we han shewed that god and verray blisfulnesse is al oo          180
  thing.'

  'That is sooth,' quod I.

  'Thanne mowen we conclude sikerly, that the substaunce of
  god is set in thilke same good, and in non other place.               184

PROSE XI.

_Assentior, inquam._

  _Boece._ 'I assente me,' quod I; 'for alle thise thinges ben
  strongly bounden with right ferme resouns.'

  _Philosophie._ 'How mochel wilt thou preysen it,' quod she,
  'yif that thou knowe what thilke good is?'

  'I wol preyse it,' quod I, 'by prys with-outen ende, yif it shal        5
  bityde me to knowe also to-gider god that is good.'

  'Certes,' quod she, 'that shal I do thee by verray resoun, yif
  that tho thinges that I have concluded a litel her-biforn dwellen
  only in hir first graunting.'

  'They dwellen graunted to thee,' quod I; _this is to seyn, as          10
  who seith: I graunte thy forseide conclusiouns_.

  'Have I nat shewed thee,' quod she, 'that the thinges that ben
  requered of many folkes ne ben nat verray goodes ne parfite, for
  they ben dyverse that oon fro that othre; and so as ech of hem
  is lakkinge to other, they ne han no power to bringen a good that      15
  is ful and absolut? But thanne at erst ben they verray good,
  whanne they ben gadered to-gider alle in-to o forme and in-to oon
  wirkinge, so that thilke thing that is suffisaunce, thilke same be
  power, and reverence, and noblesse, and mirthe; and forsothe,
  but-yif alle thise thinges ben alle oon same thing, they ne han nat    20
  wherby that they mowen ben put in the noumber of thinges that
  oughten ben requered or desired.'

  'It is shewed,' quod I; 'ne her-of may ther no man douten.'

  'The thinges thanne,' quod she, 'that ne ben no goodes
  whanne they ben dyverse, and whan they beginnen to ben alle            25
  oon thing thanne ben they goodes, ne comth it hem nat thanne
  by the getinge of unitee, that they ben maked goodes?'

  'So it semeth,' quod I.

  'But al thing that is good,' quod she, 'grauntest thou that it be
  good by the participacioun of good, or no?'                            30

  'I graunte it,' quod I.

  'Thanne most thou graunten,' quod she, 'by semblable resoun,
  that oon and good be oo same thing. For of thinges, of whiche
  that the effect nis nat naturelly diverse, nedes the substance mot
  be oo same thing.'                                                     35

  'I ne may nat denye that,' quod I.

  'Hast thou nat knowen wel,' quod she, 'that al thing that is
  hath so longe his dwellinge and his substaunce as longe as it is
  oon; but whan it forleteth to ben oon, it mot nedes dyen and
  corumpe to-gider?'                                                     40

  'In which manere?' quod I.

  'Right as in bestes,' quod she, 'whan the sowle and the body
  ben conioigned in oon and dwellen to-gider, it is cleped a beest.
  And whan hir unitee is destroyed by the disseveraunce of that oon
  from that other, than sheweth it wel that it is a ded thing, and       45
  that it nis no lenger no beest. And the body of a wight, whyl
  it dwelleth in oo forme by coniunccioun of membres, it is
  wel seyn that it is a figure of man-kinde. And yif the parties
  of the body ben so devyded and dissevered, _that oon fro that
  other_, that they destroyen unitee, the body forleteth to ben that     50
  it was biforn. And, who-so wolde renne in the same manere by
  alle thinges, he sholde seen that, with-oute doute, every thing is
  in his substaunce as longe as it is oon; and whan it forleteth to
  ben oon, it dyeth and perissheth.'

  'Whan I considere,' quod I, 'manye thinges, I see non other.'          55

  'Is ther any-thing thanne,' quod she, 'that, in as moche as it
  liveth naturelly, that forleteth the talent or appetyt of his beinge,
  and desireth to come to deeth and to corupcioun?'

  'Yif I considere,' quod I, 'the beestes that han any maner
  nature of wilninge and of nillinge, I ne finde no beest, but-yif       60
  it be constreined fro with-oute forth, that forleteth or
  despyseth the entencioun to liven and to duren, or that wole,
  his thankes, hasten him to dyen. For every beest travaileth him
  to deffende and kepe the savacioun of his lyf, and eschueth deeth
  and destruccioun.                                                      65

  But certes, I doute me of herbes and of trees, _that is to
  seyn, that I am in a doute of swiche thinges as herbes or trees_, that
  ne han no felinge sowles, _ne no naturel wirkinges servinge to
  appetytes as bestes han, whether they han appetyt to dwellen
  and to duren_.'                                                        70

  'Certes,' quod she, 'ne ther-of thar thee nat doute. Now
  loke up-on thise herbes and thise trees; they wexen first in
  swiche places as ben covenable to hem, in whiche places they
  ne mowen nat sone dyen ne dryen, as longe as hir nature may
  deffenden hem. For som of hem waxen in feeldes, and som                75
  in mountaignes, and othre waxen in mareys, and othre cleven
  on roches, and somme waxen plentivous in sondes; and yif
  that any wight enforce him to beren hem in-to othre places,
  they wexen drye. For nature yeveth to every thing that that
  is convenient to him, and travaileth that they ne dye nat, as          80
  longe as they han power to dwellen and to liven. What woltow
  seyn of this, that they drawen alle hir norisshinges by hir rotes,
  right as they hadden hir mouthes y-plounged with-in the erthes,
  and sheden by hir maryes hir wode and hir bark? And what
  woltow seyn of this, that thilke thing that is right softe, as the     85
  marye is, that is alwey hid in the sete, al with-inne, and that
  is defended fro with-oute by the stedefastnesse of wode; and
  that the uttereste bark is put ayeins the destemperaunce of
  the hevene, as a defendour mighty to suffren harm? And thus,
  certes, maystow wel seen how greet is the diligence of nature;         90
  for alle thinges renovelen and puplisshen hem with seed y-multiplyed;
  ne ther nis no man that ne wot wel that they ne
  ben right as a foundement and edifice, for to duren nat only
  for a tyme, but right as for to duren perdurably by generacioun.
  And the thinges eek that men wenen ne haven none sowles,               95
  ne desire they nat ech of hem by semblable resoun to kepen
  that is hirs, _that is to seyn, that is acordinge to hir nature in
  conservacioun of hir beinge and enduringe_? For wher-for elles
  bereth lightnesse the flaumbes up, and the weighte presseth
  the erthe a-doun, but for as moche as thilke places and thilke        100
  moevinges ben covenable to everich of hem? And forsothe
  every thing kepeth thilke that is acordinge and propre to him,
  right as thinges that ben contraries and enemys corompen hem.
  And yit the harde thinges, as stones, clyven and holden hir
  parties to-gider right faste and harde, and deffenden hem in          105
  withstondinge that they ne departe nat lightly a-twinne. And
  the thinges that ben softe and fletinge, as is water and eyr,
  they departen lightly, and yeven place to hem that breken or
  devyden hem; but natheles, they retornen sone ayein in-to
  the same thinges fro whennes they ben arraced. But fyr fleeth         110
  and refuseth al devisioun. Ne I ne trete nat heer now of
  wilful moevinges of the sowle that is knowinge, but of the
  naturel entencioun of thinges, as thus: right as we swolwe the
  mete that we receiven and ne thinke nat on it, and as we
  drawen our breeth in slepinge that we wite it nat whyle we            115
  slepen. For certes, in the beestes, the love of hir livinges ne
  of hir beinges ne comth nat of the wilninges of the sowle, but
  of the biginninges of nature. For certes, thorugh constreininge
  causes, wil desireth and embraceth ful ofte tyme the deeth
  that nature dredeth; _that is to seyn as thus: that a man may         120
  ben constreyned so, by som cause, that his wil desireth and
  taketh the deeth which that nature hateth and dredeth ful sore_.
  And somtyme we seeth the contrarye, as thus: that the wil
  of a wight destorbeth and constreyneth that that nature desireth
  and requereth al-wey, _that is to seyn_, the werk of generacioun,     125
  by the whiche generacioun only dwelleth and is sustened the
  long durabletee of mortal thinges.

  And thus this charitee and this love, that every thing hath
  to him-self, ne comth nat of the moevinge of the sowle, but
  of the entencioun of nature. For the purviaunce of god hath           130
  yeven to thinges that ben creat of him this, that is a ful
  gret cause to liven and to duren; for which they desiren
  naturelly hir lyf as longe as ever they mowen.  For which
  thou mayst nat drede, by no manere, that alle the thinges
  that ben anywhere, that they ne requeren naturelly the ferme          135
  stablenesse of perdurable dwellinge, and eek the eschuinge of
  destruccioun.'

  _Boece._ 'Now confesse I wel,' quod I, 'that I see now wel
  certeinly, with-oute doutes, the thinges that whylom semeden
  uncertain to me.'                                                     140

  'But,' quod she, 'thilke thing that desireth to be and to
  dwellen perdurably, he desireth to ben oon; for yif that that
  oon were destroyed, certes, beinge ne shulde ther non dwellen
  to no wight.'

  'That is sooth,' quod I.                                              145

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'desiren alle thinges oon?'

  'I assente,' quod I.

  'And I have shewed,' quod she, 'that thilke same oon is
  thilke that is good?'

  'Ye, for sothe,' quod I.                                              150

  'Alle thinges thanne,' quod she, 'requiren good; and thilke
  good thanne mayst thou descryven right thus: good is thilke
  thing that every wight desireth.'

  'Ther ne may be thought,' quod I, 'no more verray thing.
  For either alle thinges ben referred and brought to nought,           155
  and floteren with-oute governour, despoiled of oon as of hir
  propre heved; or elles, yif ther be any thing to which that
  alle thinges tenden and hyen, that thing moste ben the soverein
  good of alle goodes.'

  Thanne seyde she thus: 'O my nory,' quod she, 'I have                 160
  gret gladnesse of thee; for thou hast ficched in thyn herte
  the middel soothfastnesse, _that is to seyn_, the prikke; but this
  thing hath ben descovered to thee, in that thou seydest that
  thou wistest nat a litel her-biforn.'

  'What was that?' quod I.                                              165

  'That thou ne wistest nat,' quod she, 'which was the ende
  of thinges; and certes, that is the thing that every wight
  desireth; and for as mochel as we han gadered and comprehended
  that good is thilke thing that is desired of alle, thanne
  moten we nedes confessen, that good is the fyn of alle thinges.       170

_Quisquis profunda mente uestigat uerum._

  Who-so that seketh sooth by a deep thoght, and coveiteth
  nat to ben deceived by no mis-weyes, lat him rollen and trenden
  with-inne him-self the light of his inward sighte; and lat him
  gadere ayein, enclyninge in-to a compas, the longe moevinges
  _of his thoughtes_; and lat him techen his corage that he hath          5
  enclosed and hid in his tresors, al that he compasseth or seketh
  fro with-oute. And thanne thilke thinge, that the blake cloude
  of errour whylom hadde y-covered, shal lighten more cleerly
  thanne Phebus him-self ne shyneth.

  GLOSA. _Who-so wole seken the deep grounde of sooth in his             10
  thought, and wol nat be deceived by false proposiciouns that goon
  amis fro the trouthe, lat him wel examine and rolle with-inne him-self
  the nature and the propretees of the thing; and lat him yit
  eftsones examine and rollen his thoughtes by good deliberacioun, or
  that he deme; and lat him techen his sowle that it hath, by natural    15
  principles kindeliche y-hid with-in it-self, alle the trouthe the whiche
  he imagineth to ben in thinges with-oute. And thanne alle the
  derknesse of his misknowinge shal seme more evidently to sighte of
  his understondinge thanne the sonne ne semeth to sighte
  with-oute-forth._                                                      20

  For certes the body, bringinge the weighte of foryetinge, ne
  hath nat chased out of your thoughte al the cleernesse _of your
  knowinge_; for certeinly the seed of sooth haldeth and clyveth
  with-in your corage, and it is awaked and excyted by the winde
  and by the blastes of doctrine. For wherfor elles demen ye of          25
  your owne wil the rightes, whan ye ben axed, but-yif so were that
  the norisshinge _of resoun_ ne livede y-plounged in the depthe of
  your herte? _this is to seyn, how sholden men demen the sooth of
  any thing that were axed, yif ther nere a rote of soothfastnesse that
  were y-plounged and hid in naturel principles, the whiche
      soothfastnesse                                                     30
  lived with-in the deepnesse of the thought_. And yif so be
  that the Muse and the doctrine of Plato singeth sooth, al that

PROSE XII.

_Tum ego, Platoni, inquam._

  Thanne seide I thus: 'I acorde me gretly to Plato, for thou
  remembrest and recordest me thise thinges yit the secounde
  tyme; _that is to seyn_, first whan I loste my memorie by the
  contagious coniunccioun of the body with the sowle; and
  eftsones afterward, whan I loste it, confounded by the charge and       5
  by the burdene of my sorwe.'

  And thanne seide she thus: 'yif thou loke,' quod she, 'first
  the thinges that thou hast graunted, it ne shal nat ben right fer
  that thou ne shalt remembren thilke thing that thou seydest that
  thou nistest nat.'                                                     10

  'What thing?' quod I.

  'By whiche governement,' quod she, 'that this world is
  governed.'

  'Me remembreth it wel,' quod I; 'and I confesse wel that I
  ne wiste it naught. But al-be-it so that I see now from a-fer          15
  what thou purposest, algates, I desire yit to herkene it of thee
  more pleynly.'

  'Thou ne wendest nat,' quod she, 'a litel her-biforn, that men
  sholden doute that this world nis governed by god.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'ne yit ne doute I it naught, ne I nel never         20
  wene that it were to doute; _as who seith, but I wot wel that god
  governeth this world_; and I shal shortly answeren thee by what
  resouns I am brought to this. This world,' quod I, 'of so manye
  dyverse and contrarious parties, ne mighte never han ben
  assembled in o forme, but-yif ther nere oon that conioignede so        25
  manye dyverse thinges; and the same dyversitee of hir natures,
  that so discorden that oon fro that other, moste departen and
  unioignen the thinges that ben conioigned, yif ther ne were oon
  that contenede that he hath conioined and y-bounde.  Ne the
  certein ordre of nature ne sholde nat bringe forth so ordenee          30
  moevinges, by places, by tymes, by doinges, by spaces, by
  qualitees, yif ther ne were oon that were ay stedefast dwellinge,
  that ordeynede and disponede thise dyversitees of moevinges.
  And thilke thing, what-so-ever it be, by which that alle thinges
  ben y-maked and y-lad, I clepe him "god"; that is a word that          35
  is used to alle folk.'

  Thanne seyde she: 'sin thou felest thus thise thinges,' quod
  she, 'I trowe that I have litel more to done that thou, mighty of
  welefulnesse, hool and sounde, ne see eftsones thy contree.
  But lat us loken the thinges that we han purposed her-biforn.          40
  Have I nat noumbred and seyd,' quod she, 'that suffisaunce is in
  blisfulnesse, and we han acorded that god is thilke same blisfulnesse?'

  'Yis, forsothe,' quod I.

  'And that, to governe this world,' quod she, 'ne shal he never         45
  han nede of non help fro with-oute? For elles, yif he hadde
  nede of any help, he ne sholde nat have no ful suffisaunce?'

  'Yis, thus it mot nedes be,' quod I.

  'Thanne ordeineth he by him-self al-one alle thinges?' quod she.

  'That may nat be deneyed,' quod I.                                     50

  'And I have shewed that god is the same good?'

  'It remembreth me wel,' quod I.

  'Thanne ordeineth he alle thinges by thilke good,' quod she;
  'sin he, which that we han acorded to be good, governeth alle
  thinges by him-self; and he is as a keye and a stere by which          55
  that the edifice of this world is y-kept stable and with-oute
  coroumpinge.'

  'I acorde me greetly,' quod I; 'and I aperceivede a litel her-biforn
  that thou woldest seye thus; al-be-it so that it were by
  a thinne suspecioun.'                                                  60

  'I trowe it wel,' quod she; 'for, as I trowe, thou ledest now
  more ententifly thyne eyen to loken the verray goodes. But
  natheles the thing that I shal telle thee yit ne sheweth nat lasse to
  loken.'

  'What is that?' quod I.                                                65

  'So as men trowen,' quod she, 'and that rightfully, that god
  governeth alle thinges by the keye of his goodnesse, and alle thise
  same thinges, as I have taught thee, hasten hem by naturel
  entencioun to comen to good: ther may no man douten that they
  ne be governed voluntariely, and that they ne converten hem of         70
  hir owne wil to the wil of hir ordenour, as they that ben acordinge
  and enclyninge to hir governour and hir king.'

  'It mot nedes be so,' quod I; 'for the reaume ne sholde nat
  semen blisful yif ther were a yok of misdrawinges in dyverse
  parties; ne the savinge of obedient thinges ne sholde nat be.'         75

  'Thanne is ther nothing,' quod she, 'that kepeth his nature,
  that enforceth him to goon ayein god?'

  'No,' quod I.

  'And yif that any-thing enforcede him to with-stonde god,
  mighte it availen at the laste ayeins him, that we han graunted to     80
  ben almighty by the right of blisfulnesse?'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'al-outrely it ne mighte nat availen him.'

  'Thanne is ther no-thing,' quod she, 'that either wole or may
  with-stonden to this soverein good?'

  'I trowe nat,' quod I.                                                 85

  'Thanne is thilke the soverein good,' quod she, 'that alle
  thinges governeth strongly, and ordeyneth hem softely.'

  Thanne seyde I thus: 'I delyte me,' quod I, 'nat only in the
  endes or in the somme of the resouns that thou hast concluded
  and proeved, but thilke wordes that thou usest delyten me moche        90
  more; so, at the laste, fooles that sumtyme renden grete thinges
  oughten ben ashamed of hem-self;' _that is to seyn, that we fooles
  that reprehenden wikkedly the thinges that touchen goddes governaunce,
  we oughten ben ashamed of our-self: as I, that seyde that
  god refuseth only the werkes of men, and ne entremeteth nat of         95
  hem_.

  'Thou hast wel herd,' quod she, 'the fables of the poetes,
  how the giaunts assaileden the hevene _with the goddes_; but forsothe,
  the debonair force _of god_ deposede hem, as it was worthy;
  _that is to seyn, destroyede the giaunts, as it was worthy_. But wilt 100
  thou that we ioignen to-gider thilke same resouns? For per-aventure,
  of swich coniuncioun may sterten up som fair sparkle
  of sooth.'

  'Do,' quod I, 'as thee liste.'

  'Wenest thou,' quod she, 'that god ne be almighty? No man             105
  is in doute of it.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'no wight ne douteth it, yif he be in his
  minde.'

  'But he,' quod she, 'that is almighty, ther nis nothing that he
  ne may?'                                                              110

  'That is sooth,' quod I.

  'May god don yvel?' quod she.

  'Nay, forsothe,' quod I.

  'Thanne is yvel nothing,' quod she, 'sin that he ne may nat
  don yvel that may don alle thinges.'                                  115

  'Scornest thou me?' quod I; '_or elles pleyest thou or deceivest
  thou me_, that hast so woven me with thy resouns the hous of
  Dedalus, so entrelaced that it is unable to be unlaced; thou that
  other-whyle entrest ther thou issest, and other-whyle issest ther
  thou entrest, ne foldest thou nat to-gider, _by replicacioun of       120
  wordes_, a maner wonderful cercle or environinge of the simplicitee
  devyne? For certes, a litel her-biforn, whan thou bigunne at
  blisfulnesse, thou seydest that it is soverein good; and seydest
  that it is set in soverein god; and seydest that god him-self
  is soverein good; and that god is the fulle blisfulnesse; for which   125
  thou yave me as a covenable yift, _that is to seyn_, that no wight
  nis blisful but-yif he be god also ther-with. And seidest eek,
  that the forme of good is the substaunce of god and of blisfulnesse;
  and seidest, that thilke same oon is thilke same good, that is
  requered and desired of alle the kinde of thinges. And thou           130
  proevedest, in disputinge, that god governeth all the thinges of
  the world by the governements of bountee, _and seydest_, that alle
  thinges wolen obeyen to him; and _seydest_, that the nature of yvel
  nis no-thing. And thise thinges ne shewedest thou nat with none
  resouns y-taken fro with-oute, but by proeves _in cercles and_
      hoomlich                                                          135
  knowen; the whiche proeves drawen to hem-self hir feith and
  hir acord, everich of hem of other.'

  Thanne seyde she thus: 'I ne scorne thee nat, _ne pleye, ne
  deceive thee_; but I have shewed thee the thing that is grettest
  over alle thinges by the yift of god, that we whylom preyeden.        140
  For this is the forme of the devyne substaunce, that is swich that
  it ne slydeth nat in-to outterest foreine thinges, ne ne receiveth
  no straunge thinges in him; but right as Parmenides seyde _in
  Greek_ of thilke devyne substaunce; he seyde thus: that "thilke
  devyne substaunce torneth the world and the moevable cercle of        145
  thinges, whyl thilke devyne substaunce kepeth it-self with-oute
  moevinge;" _that is to seyn, that it ne moeveth never-mo, and yit it
  moeveth alle othre thinges_. But natheles, yif I have stired resouns
  that ne ben nat taken fro with-oute the compas of thing of which
  we treten, but resouns that ben bistowed with-in that compas,         150
  ther nis nat why that thou sholdest merveilen; sin thou hast
  lerned by the sentence of Plato, that "nedes the wordes moten
  be cosines to the thinges of which they speken."

METRE XII.

_Felix, qui potuit boni._

  Blisful is that man that may seen the clere welle of good; blisful
  is he that may unbinden him fro the bondes of the hevy erthe.
  The poete of Trace, _Orpheus_, that whylom hadde right greet sorwe
  for the deeth of his wyf, after that he hadde maked, by his weeply
  songes, the wodes, moevable, to rennen; and hadde maked the             5
  riveres to stonden stille; and hadde maked the hertes and the
  hindes to ioignen, dredeles, hir sydes to cruel lyouns, _for to herknen
  his songe_; and hadde maked that the hare was nat agast of the
  hounde, which that was plesed by his songe: so, whan the moste
  ardaunt love of his wif brende the entrailes of his brest, ne the      10
  songes that hadden overcomen alle thinges ne mighten nat
  asswagen hir lord _Orpheus_, he pleynede him of the hevene goddes
  that weren cruel to him; he wente him to the houses of helle.
  And there he temprede hise blaundisshinge songes by resowninge
  strenges, and spak and song in wepinge al that ever he hadde           15
  received and laved out of the noble welles of his moder _Calliope_
  the goddesse; and he song with as mochel as he mighte of wepinge,
  and with as moche as love, that doublede his sorwe, mighte
  yeve him and techen him; and he commoevede the helle, and
  requerede and bisoughte by swete preyere the lordes of sowles          20
  in helle, of relesinge; _that is to seyn, to yilden him his wyf_.

  _Cerberus_, the porter of helle, with his three hevedes, was caught
  and al abayst for the newe song; and the three goddesses, _Furies_,
  and vengeresses of felonyes, that tormenten and agasten the sowles
  by anoy, woxen sorwful and sory, and wepen teres for pitee.            25
  Tho ne was nat the heved of Ixion y-tormented by the overthrowinge
  wheel; and Tantalus, that was destroyed by the woodnesse
  of longe thurst, despyseth the flodes to drinke; the fowl that
  highte voltor, that eteth the stomak or the giser of Tityus, is so
  fulfild of his song that it nil eten ne tyren no more. At the laste    30
  the lord and Iuge of sowles was moeved to misericordes and
  cryde, "we ben overcomen," quod he; "yive we to Orpheus his
  wyf to bere him companye; he hath wel y-bought hir by his song
  and his ditee; but we wol putte a lawe in this, and covenaunt in
  the yifte: _that is to seyn_, that, til he be out of helle, yif he
      loke                                                               35
  behinde him, that his wyf shal comen ayein unto us."

  But what is he that may yive a lawe to loveres? Love is
  a gretter lawe and a strenger to him-self _than any lawe that men
  may yeven_. Allas! whan Orpheus and his wyf weren almest at the
  termes of the night, _that is to seyn, at the laste boundes of helle_, 40
  Orpheus lokede abakward on Eurydice his wyf, and loste hir, and
  was deed.

  This fable aperteineth to yow alle, who-so-ever desireth or
  seketh to lede his thought in-to the soverein day, _that is to seyn,
  to cleernesse of soverein good_. For who-so that ever be so overcomen  45
  that he ficche his eyen into the putte of helle, _that is to
  seyn, who-so sette his thoughtes in erthely thinges_, al that ever he
  hath drawen of the noble good celestial, he leseth it whan he
  loketh the helles,' _that is to seyn, in-to lowe thinges of the erthe_.

BOOK IV.


PROSE I.

_Hec cum Philosophia, dignitate uultus._

  Whan Philosophye hadde songen softely and delitably the
  forseide thinges, kepinge the dignitee of hir chere and the
  weighte of hir wordes, I thanne, that ne hadde nat al-outerly
  foryeten the wepinge and the mourninge that was set in myn
  herte, forbrak the entencioun of hir that entendede yit to seyn         5
  some othre thinges. 'O,' quod I, 'thou that art gyderesse of
  verrey light; the thinges that thou hast seid me hider-to ben so
  clere to me and so shewinge by the devyne lookinge of hem, and
  by thy resouns, that they ne mowen ben overcomen. And
  thilke thinges that thou toldest me, al-be-it so that I hadde          10
  whylom foryeten hem, for the sorwe of the wrong that hath ben
  don to me, yit natheles they ne weren nat al-outrely unknowen to
  me. But this same is, namely, a right greet cause of my sorwe,
  so as the governour of thinges is good, yif that yveles mowen ben
  by any weyes; or elles yif that yveles passen with-oute punisshinge.   15
  The whiche thing only, how worthy it is to ben wondred
  up-on, thou considerest it wel thy-self certeinly. But yit to this
  thing ther is yit another thing y-ioigned, more to ben wondred
  up-on. For felonye is emperesse, and floureth _ful of richesses_;
  and vertu nis nat al-only with-oute medes, but it is cast under and    20
  fortroden under the feet of felonous folk; and it abyeth the
  torments in stede of wikkede felounes. Of alle whiche thinges
  ther nis no wight that may merveylen y-nough, ne compleine,
  that swiche thinges ben doon in the regne of god, that alle thinges
  woot and alle thinges may, and ne wole nat but only gode               25
  thinges.'

  Thanne seyde she thus: 'Certes,' quod she, 'that were a greet
  merveyle, and an enbasshinge with-outen ende, and wel more
  horrible than alle monstres, yif it were as thou wenest; _that is to
  seyn_, that in the right ordenee hous of so mochel a fader and an      30
  ordenour of meynee, that the vesseles that ben foule and vyle
  sholden ben honoured and heried, and the precious vesseles
  sholden ben defouled and vyle; but it nis nat so. For yif tho
  thinges that I have concluded a litel her-biforn ben kept hole
  and unraced, thou shalt wel knowe by the autoritee of god, of the      35
  whos regne I speke, that certes the gode folk ben alwey mighty,
  and shrewes ben alwey out-cast and feble; ne the vyces ne ben
  never-mo with-oute peyne, ne the vertues ne ben nat with-oute

  I have, forsothe, swifte fetheres that surmounten the heighte of
  hevene. Whan the swifte thought hath clothed it-self in tho
  fetheres, it despyseth the hateful erthes, and surmounteth the
  roundnesse of the grete ayr; and it seeth the cloudes behinde his
  bak; and passeth the heighte of the region of the fyr, that             5
  eschaufeth by the swifte moevinge of the firmament, til that he
  areyseth him in-to the houses that beren the sterres, and ioyneth
  his weyes with the sonne Phebus, and felawshipeth the wey of

PROSE II.

_Tum ego, Papae, inquam._

  Than seyde I thus: 'owh! I wondre me that thou bihetest me
  so grete thinges; ne I ne doute nat that thou ne mayst wel
  performe that thou bihetest. But I preye thee only this, that
  thou ne tarye nat to telle me thilke thinges that thou hast
  moeved.'                                                                5

  'First,' quod she, 'thou most nedes knowen, that goode folk
  ben alwey stronge and mighty, and the shrewes ben feble and
  desert and naked of alle strengthes. And of thise thinges, certes,
  everich of hem is declared and shewed by other. For so as
  good and yvel ben two contraries, yif so be that good be stedefast,    10
  than sheweth the feblesse of yvel al openly; and yif thou
  knowe cleerly the frelenesse of yvel, the stedefastnesse of good is
  knowen. But for as moche as the fey of my sentence shal be the
  more ferme and haboundaunt, I will gon by that oo wey and by
  that other; and I wole conferme the thinges that ben purposed,         15
  now on this syde and now on that syde. Two thinges ther ben
  in whiche the effect of alle the dedes of mankinde standeth, that
  is to seyn, wil and power; and yif that oon of thise two fayleth,
  ther nis nothing that may be don. For yif that wil lakketh, ther
  nis no wight that undertaketh to don that he wol nat don; and          20
  yif power fayleth, the wil nis but in ydel and stant for naught.
  And ther-of cometh it, that yif thou see a wight that wolde geten
  that he may nat geten, thou mayst nat douten that power ne
  fayleth him to haven that he wolde.'

  'This is open and cleer,' quod I; 'ne it may nat ben deneyed           25
  in no manere.'

  'And yif thou see a wight,' quod she, 'that hath doon that he
  wolde doon, thou nilt nat douten that he ne hath had power to
  don it?'

  'No,' quod I.                                                          30

  'And in that that every wight may, in that men may holden
  him mighty; _as who seyth, in so moche as man is mighty to don a
  thing, in so mochel men halt him mighty_; and in that that he ne
  may, in that men demen him to be feble.'

  'I confesse it wel,' quod I.                                           35

  'Remembreth thee,' quod she, 'that I have gadered and
  shewed by forseyde resouns that al the entencioun of the wil of
  mankinde, which that is lad by dyverse studies, hasteth to
  comen to blisfulnesse?'

  'It remembreth me wel,' quod I, 'that it hath ben shewed.'             40

  'And recordeth thee nat thanne,' quod she, 'that blisfulnesse
  is thilke same good that men requeren; so that, whan that
  blisfulnesse is requered of alle, that good also is requered and
  desired of alle?'

  'It ne recordeth me nat,' quod I; 'for I have it gretly alwey          45
  ficched in my memorie.'

  'Alle folk thanne,' quod she, 'goode and eek badde, enforcen
  hem with-oute difference of entencioun to comen to good?'

  'This is a verray consequence,' quod I.

  'And certein is,' quod she, 'that by the getinge of good ben           50
  men y-maked goode?'

  'This is certein,' quod I.

  'Thanne geten goode men that they desiren?'

  'So semeth it,' quod I.

  'But wikkede folk,' quod she, 'yif they geten the good that            55
  they desiren, they ne mowe nat be wikkede?'

  'So is it,' quod I.

  'Thanne, so as that oon and that other,' quod she, 'desiren
  good; and the goode folk geten good, and nat the wikke folk;
  thanne nis it no doute that the goode folk ne ben mighty and           60
  the wikkede folk ben feble?'

  'Who-so that ever,' quod I, 'douteth of this, he ne may nat
  considere the nature of thinges ne the consequence of resouns.'

  And over this quod she, 'yif that ther be two thinges that
  han oo same purpose by kinde, and that oon of hem pursueth             65
  and parformeth thilke same thing by naturel office, and that
  other ne may nat doon thilke naturel office, but folweth, by other
  manere thanne is convenable to nature, him that acomplissheth
  his purpos kindely, and yit he ne acomplissheth nat his owne
  purpos: whether of thise two demestow for more mighty?'                70

  'Yif that I coniecte,' quod I, 'that thou wolt seye, algates yit
  I desire to herkne it more pleynly of thee.'

  'Thou wilt nat thanne deneye,' quod she, 'that the moevement
  of goinge nis in men by kinde?'

  'No, forsothe,' quod I.                                                75

  'Ne thou ne doutest nat,' quod she, 'that thilke naturel office
  of goinge ne be the office of feet?'

  'I ne doute it nat,' quod I.

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'yif that a wight be mighty to moeve and
  goth upon his feet, and another, to whom thilke naturel office of      80
  feet lakketh, enforceth him to gon crepinge up-on his handes:
  whiche of thise two oughte to ben holden the more mighty by
  right?'

  'Knit forth the remenaunt,' quod I; 'for no wight ne douteth
  that he that may gon by naturel office of feet ne be more mighty       85
  than he that ne may nat.'

  'But the soverein good,' quod she, 'that is eveneliche purposed
  to the gode folk and to badde, the gode folk seken it by naturel
  office of vertues, and the shrewes enforcen hem to geten it by
  dyverse coveityse _of erthely thinges_, which that nis no naturel
      office                                                             90
  to geten thilke same soverein good. Trowestow that it be any
  other wyse?'

  'Nay,' quod I; 'for the consequence is open and shewinge of
  thinges that I have graunted; that nedes gode folk moten ben
  mighty, and shrewes feeble and unmighty.'                              95

  'Thou rennest a-right biforn me,' quod she, 'and this is the
  Iugement; _that is to seyn, I iuge of thee_ right as thise leches ben
  wont to hopen _of syke folk, whan they aperceyven_ that nature is
  redressed and withstondeth to the maladye. But, for I see thee
  now al redy to the understondinge, I shal shewe thee more thikke      100
  and continuel resouns. For loke now how greetly sheweth the
  feblesse and infirmitee of wikkede folk, that ne mowen nat comen
  to that hir naturel entencioun ledeth hem, and yit almost thilke
  naturel entencioun constreineth hem. And what _were to demen
  thanne of shrewes_, yif thilke naturel help hadde forleten hem, the   105
  which _naturel help of intencioun_ goth awey biforn hem, and is so
  greet that unnethe it may ben overcome? Consider thanne how
  greet defaute of power and how greet feblesse ther is in wikkede
  felonous folk; _as who seyth, the gretter thing that is coveited and
  the desire nat acomplisshed, of the lasse might is he that coveiteth
      it                                                                110
  and may nat acomplisshe. And forthy Philosophie seyth thus by
  soverein good_: Ne shrewes ne requeren nat lighte medes ne veyne
  games, whiche they ne may folwen ne holden; but they failen of
  thilke somme and of the heighte of thinges, _that is to seyn, soverein
  good_; ne thise wrecches ne comen nat to the effect _of soverein      115
  good_, the which they enforcen hem only to geten, by nightes and
  by dayes; in the getinge of which good the strengthe of good folk
  is ful wel y-sene. For right so as thou mightest demen him mighty
  of goinge, that gooth on his feet til he mighte come to thilke
  place, fro the whiche place ther ne laye no wey forther to ben        120
  gon; right so most thou nedes demen him for right mighty, that
  geteth and ateyneth to the ende of alle thinges that ben to desire,
  biyonde the whiche ende ther nis nothing to desire. Of the
  which _power of good folk_ men may conclude, that the wikked
  men semen to be bareine and naked of alle strengthe. For-why          125
  forleten they vertues and folwen vyces? Nis it nat for that they
  ne knowen nat the goodes? But what thing is more feble and
  more caitif thanne is the blindnesse of ignoraunce? Or elles they
  knowen ful wel whiche thinges that they oughten folwe, but
  lecherye and coveityse overthroweth hem mistorned; and certes,        130
  so doth distemperaunce to feble men, that ne mowen nat wrastlen
  ayeins the vyces. Ne knowen they nat thanne wel that they
  forleten the good wilfully, and tornen hem wilfully to vyces? And
  in this wyse they ne forleten nat only to ben mighty, but they
  forleten al-outrely in any wyse for to ben. For they that forleten    135
  the comune fyn of alle thinges that ben, they forleten also therwith-al
  for to ben.

  And per-aventure it sholde semen to som folk that this were
  a merveile to seyen: that shrewes, whiche that contienen the more
  partye of men, ne ben nat ne han no beinge; but natheles, it is so,   140
  and thus stant this thing. For they that ben shrewes, I deneye
  nat that they ben shrewes; but I deneye, and seye simplely and
  pleinly, that they ne ben nat, ne han no beinge. For right as
  thou mightest seyen of the carayne of a man, that it were a deed
  man, but thou ne mightest nat simplely callen it a man; so graunte    145
  I wel forsothe, that vicious folk ben wikked, but I ne may nat
  graunten absolutly and simplely that they ben. For thilke thing
  that with-holdeth ordre and kepeth nature, thilke thing is and
  hath beinge; but what thing that faileth of that, _that is to seyn,
  that he forleteth naturel ordre_, he forleteth thilke thing that is
      set                                                               150
  in his nature. But thou wolt seyn, that shrewes mowen. Certes,
  that ne deneye I nat; but certes, hir power ne descendeth nat of
  strengthe, but of feblesse. For they mowen don wikkednesses;
  the whiche they ne mighte nat don, yif they mighten dwellen in
  the forme and in the doinge of good folk. And thilke power            155
  sheweth ful evidently that they ne mowen right naught. For so
  as I have gadered and proeved a litel her-biforn, that yvel is
  naught; and so as shrewes mowen only but shrewednesses, this
  conclusioun is al cleer, that shrewes ne mowen right naught, ne
  han no power.                                                         160

  And for as moche as thou understonde which is the strengthe
  of this power of shrewes, I have definisshed a litel her-biforn, that
  nothing is so mighty as soverein good.'

  'That is sooth,' quod I.

  'And thilke same soverein good may don non yvel?'                     165

  'Certes, no,' quod I.

  'Is ther any wight thanne,' quod she, 'that weneth that men
  mowen doon alle thinges?'

  'No man,' quod I, 'but-yif he be out of his witte.'

  'But, certes, shrewes mowen don yvel,' quod she.                      170

  'Ye, wolde god,' quod I, 'that they mighten don non!'

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'so as he that is mighty to doon only but
  goode thinges may don alle thinges; and they that ben mighty to
  don yvele thinges ne mowen nat alle thinges: thanne is it open
  thing and manifest, that they that mowen don yvel ben of lasse        175
  power. And yit, _to proeve this conclusioun_, ther helpeth me this,
  that I have y-shewed her-biforn, that alle power is to be noumbred
  among thinges that men oughten requere. And I have shewed
  that alle thinges, that oughten ben desired, ben referred to good,
  right as to a maner heighte of hir nature. But for to mowen don       180
  yvel and felonye ne may nat ben referred to good. Thanne nis
  nat yvel of the noumbir of thinges that oughte ben desired. But
  alle power oughte ben desired and requered. Than is it open and
  cleer that the power ne the mowinge of shrewes nis no power; and
  of alle thise thinges it sheweth wel, that the goode folke ben
      certeinly                                                         185
  mighty, and the shrewes douteles ben unmighty. And it is
  cleer and open that thilke opinioun of Plato is verray and sooth, that
  seith, that only wyse men may doon that they desiren; and
  shrewes mowen haunten that hem lyketh, but that they desiren,
  _that is to seyn, to comen to sovereign good_, they ne han no power   190
  to acomplisshen that. For shrewes don that hem list, whan, by
  tho thinges in which they delyten, they wenen to ateine to thilke
  good that they desiren; but they ne geten ne ateinen nat ther-to,
  for vyces ne comen nat to blisfulnesse.

PROSE III.

_Videsne igitur quanto in coeno._

  Seestow nat thanne in how grete filthe thise shrewes ben
  y-wrapped, and with which cleernesse thise good folk shynen? In
  this sheweth it wel, that to goode folk ne lakketh never-mo hir
  medes, ne shrewes lakken never-mo torments. For of alle thinges
  that ben y-doon, thilke thing, for which any-thing is don, it semeth    5
  as by right that thilke thing be the mede of that; as thus: yif
  a man renneth in the stadie, _or in the forlong_, for the corone,
  thanne lyth the mede in the corone for which he renneth. And
  I have shewed that blisfulnesse is thilke same good for which
  that alle thinges ben doon. Thanne is thilke same good purposed        10
  to the workes of mankinde right as a comune mede; which
  mede ne may ben dissevered fro good folk. For no wight as by
  right, fro thennes-forth that him lakketh goodnesse, ne shal ben
  cleped good. For which thing, folk of goode maneres, hir medes
  ne forsaken hem never-mo. For al-be-it so that shrewes wexen           15
  as wode as hem list _ayeins goode folk_, yit never-the-lesse the
  corone of wyse men shal nat fallen ne faden. For foreine shrewednesse
  ne binimeth nat fro the corages of goode folk hir propre
  honour. But yif that any wight reioyse him of goodnesse that he
  hadde take fro with-oute (_as who seith, yif that any wight hadde      20
  his goodnesse of any other man than of him-self_), certes, he that yaf
  him thilke goodnesse, or elles som other wight, mighte binime it
  him. But for as moche as to every wight his owne propre bountee
  yeveth him his mede, thanne at erst shal he failen of mede whan
  he forleteth to ben good. And at the laste, so as alle medes ben       25
  requered for men wenen that they ben goode, who is he that
  wolde deme, that he that is right mighty of good were part-les of
  mede? And of what mede shal he be guerdoned? Certes, of
  right faire mede and right grete aboven alle medes. Remembre
  thee of thilke noble corolarie that I yaf thee a litel her-biforn;     30
  and gader it to-gider in this manere:--so as good him-self is
  blisfulnesse, thanne is it cleer and certein, that alle good folk ben
  maked blisful for they ben goode; and thilke folk that ben blisful,
  it acordeth and is covenable to ben goddes. Thanne is the mede
  of goode folk swich that no day shal enpeiren it, ne no wikkednesse    35
  ne shal derken it, ne power of no wight ne shal nat amenusen it,
  _that is to seyn_, to ben maked goddes.

  And sin it is thus, _that goode men ne failen never-mo of hir mede_,
  certes, no wys man ne may doute of undepartable peyne of the
  shrewes; _that is to seyn, that the peyne of shrewes ne departeth nat  40
  from hem-self never-mo_. For so as goode and yvel, and peyne and
  medes ben contrarye, it mot nedes ben, that right as we seen
  bityden in guerdoun of goode, that also mot the peyne of yvel
  answery, by the contrarye party, to shrewes. Now thanne, so as
  bountee and prowesse ben the mede to goode folk, al-so is              45
  shrewednesse it-self torment to shrewes. Thanne, who-so that
  ever is entecched and defouled with peyne, he ne douteth nat,
  that he is entecched and defouled with yvel. Yif shrewes thanne
  wolen preysen hem-self, may it semen to hem that they ben with-outen
  party of torment, sin they ben swiche that the uttereste               50
  wikkednesse (_that is to seyn, wikkede thewes, which that is the
  uttereste and the worste kinde of shrewednesse_) ne defouleth ne
  enteccheth nat hem only, but infecteth and envenimeth hem
  gretly? And also look on shrewes, that ben the contrarie party
  of goode men, how greet peyne felawshipeth and folweth hem!            55
  For thou hast lerned a litel her-biforn, that al thing that is and
  hath beinge is oon, and thilke same oon is good; thanne is this
  the consequence, that it semeth wel, that al that is and hath beinge
  is good; _this is to seyn, as who seyth, that beinge and unitee and
  goodnesse is al oon_. And in this manere it folweth thanne, that al    60
  thing that faileth to ben good, it stinteth for to be and for to han
  any beinge; wherfore it is, that shrewes stinten for to ben that
  they weren. But thilke other forme of mankinde, that is to seyn,
  the forme of the body with-oute, sheweth yit that thise shrewes
  weren whylom men; wher-for, whan they ben perverted and                65
  torned in-to malice, certes, than han they forlorn the nature of
  mankinde. But so as only bountee and prowesse may enhaunsen
  every man over other men; thanne mot it nedes be that shrewes,
  which that shrewednesse hath cast out of the condicioun of mankinde,
  ben put under the merite and the desert of men. Thanne                 70
  bitydeth it, that yif thou seest a wight that be transformed into
  vyces, thou ne mayst nat wene that he be a man.

  For yif he be ardaunt in avaryce, and that he be a ravinour by
  violence of foreine richesse, thou shalt seyn that he is lyke to the
  wolf. And yif he be felonous and with-oute reste, and exercyse         75
  his tonge to chydinges, thou shalt lykne him to the hound. And
  yif he be a prevey awaitour y-hid, and reioyseth him to ravisshe
  by wyles, thou shalt seyn him lyke to the fox-whelpes. And yif he
  be distempre and quaketh for ire, men shal wene that he bereth
  the corage of a lyoun. And yif he be dredful and fleinge, and          80
  dredeth thinges that ne oughten nat to ben dred, men shal holden
  him lyk to the hert. And yif he be slow and astoned and lache, he
  liveth as an asse. And yif he be light and unstedefast of corage, and
  chaungeth ay his studies, he is lykned to briddes. And if he be
  plounged in foule and unclene luxuries, he is with-holden in the       85
  foule delyces of the foule sowe. Thanne folweth it, that he that
      forleteth
  bountee and prowesse, he forleteth to ben a man; sin he may
  nat passen in-to the condicioun of god, he is torned in-to a beest.

METRE III.

_Vela Neritii dulcis._

  Eurus _the wind_ aryvede the sailes of _Ulixes_, duk of the contree
  of Narice, and his wandringe shippes by the see, in-to the ile
  ther-as _Circes_, the faire goddesse, doughter of the sonne,

  touched and maked with enchauntements. And after that hir               5
  hand, mighty over the herbes, hadde chaunged hir gestes in-to
  dyverse maneres; that oon of hem, is covered his face with forme
  of a boor; that other is chaunged in-to a lyoun of the contree of

  hem is neweliche chaunged in-to a wolf, and howleth whan he            10

  But al-be-it so that the godhed of _Mercurie, that is cleped_ the

PROSE IV.

_Tum ego, Fateor, inquam._

  Than seyde I thus: 'I confesse and am a-knowe it,' quod I;
  'ne I ne see nat that men may sayn, as by right, that shrewes ne
  ben chaunged in-to bestes by the qualitee of hir soules, al-be-it so
  that they kepen yit the forme of the body of mankinde. But I
  nolde nat of shrewes, of which the thought cruel woodeth al-wey         5
  in-to destruccioun of goode men, that it were leveful to hem to
  don that.'

  'Certes,' quod she, 'ne is nis nat leveful to hem, as I shal wel
  shewe thee in covenable place; but natheles, yif so were that thilke
  that men wenen be leveful to shrewes were binomen hem, _so that        10
  they ne mighte nat anoyen or doon harm to goode men_, certes, a
  greet partye of the peyne to shrewes sholde ben allegged and
  releved. For al-be-it so that this ne seme nat credible thing,
  per-aventure, to some folk, yit moot it nedes be, that shrewes ben
  more wrecches and unsely whan they may doon and performe               15
  that they coveiten, than yif they mighte nat complisshen that they
  coveiten. For yif so be that it be wrecchednesse to wilne to don
  yvel, than is more wrecchednesse to mowen don yvel; with-oute
  whiche mowinge the wrecched wil sholde languisshe with-oute
  effect. Than, sin that everiche of thise thinges hath his              20
  wrecchednesse, _that is to seyn, wil to don yvel and mowinge to don
  yvel_, it moot nedes be that they ben constreyned by three
  unselinesses, that wolen and mowen and performen felonyes and
  shrewednesses.'

  'I acorde me,' quod I; 'but I desire gretly that shrewes               25
  losten sone thilke unselinesse, _that is to seyn_, that shrewes weren
  despoyled of mowinge to don yvel.'

  'So shullen they,' quod she, 'soner, per-aventure, than thou
  woldest; or soner than they hem-self wene to lakken _mowinge to
  don yvel_. For ther nis no-thing so late in so shorte boundes of       30
  this lyf, that is long to abyde, nameliche, to a corage inmortel;
  of whiche shrewes the grete hope, and the hye compassinges of
  shrewednesses, is ofte destroyed by a sodeyn ende, or they ben
  war; and that thing estableth to shrewes the ende of hir
  shrewednesse. For yif that shrewednesse maketh wrecches, than          35
  mot he nedes ben most wrecched that lengest is a shrewe; the
  whiche wikked shrewes wolde I demen aldermost unsely and caitifs,
  yif that hir shrewednesse ne were finisshed, at the leste wey, by
  the outtereste deeth. For yif I have concluded sooth of the unselinesse
  of shrewednesse, than sheweth it cleerly that thilke                   40
  wrecchednesse is with-outen ende, the whiche is certein to ben
  perdurable.'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'this conclusioun is hard and wonderful to
  graunte; but I knowe wel that it acordeth moche to the thinges
  that I have graunted her-biforn.'                                      45

  'Thou hast,' quod she, 'the right estimacioun of this; but
  who-so-ever wene that it be a hard thing to acorde him to a
  conclusioun, it is right that he shewe that some of the premisses
  ben false; or elles he moot shewe that the collacioun of proposiciouns
  nis nat speedful to a necessarie conclusioun. And yif it               50
  be nat so, but that the premisses ben y-graunted, ther is not why
  he sholde blame the argument.

  For this thing that I shal telle thee now ne shal nat seme lasse
  wonderful; but of the thinges that ben taken also it is necessarie;'
  _as who seyth, it folweth of that which that is purposed biforn_.      55

  'What is that?' quod I.

  'Certes,' quod she, 'that is, that thise wikked shrewes ben
  more blisful, _or elles lasse wrecches_, that abyen the torments that
  they han deserved, than yif no peyne of Iustice ne chastysede
  hem. Ne this ne seye I nat now, for that any man mighte                60
  thenke, that the maners of shrewes ben coriged and chastysed by
  veniaunce, and that they ben brought to the right wey by the
  drede of the torment, ne for that they yeven to other folk
  ensaumple to fleen fro vyces; but I understande yit in another
  manere, that shrewes ben more unsely whan they ne ben nat              65
  punisshed, al-be-it so that ther ne be had no resoun or lawe of
  correccioun, ne non ensaumple of lokinge.'

  'And what manere shal that ben,' quod I, 'other than hath be
  told her-biforn?'

  'Have we nat thanne graunted,' quod she, 'that goode folk              70
  ben blisful, and shrewes ben wrecches?'

  'Yis,' quod I.

  'Thanne,' quod she, 'yif that any good were added to the
  wrecchednesse of any wight, nis he nat more weleful than he that
  ne hath no medlinge of good in his solitarie wrecchednesse?'           75

  'So semeth it,' quod I.

  'And what seystow thanne,' quod she, 'of thilke wrecche that
  lakketh alle goodes, _so that no good nis medled in his wrecchednesse_,
  and yit, over al his wikkednesse for which he is a wrecche, that
  ther be yit another yvel anexed and knit to him, shal nat men          80
  demen him more unsely than thilke wrecche of whiche the unselinesse
  is releved by the participacioun of som good?'

  'Why sholde he nat?' quod I.

  'Thanne, certes,' quod she, 'han shrewes, whan they ben
  punisshed, som-what of good anexed to hir wrecchednesse, that is       85
  to seyn, the same peyne that they suffren, which that is good by
  the resoun of Iustice; and whan thilke same shrewes ascapen
  with-oute torment, than han they som-what more of yvel yit over
  the wikkednesse that they han don, _that is to seyn_, defaute of
  peyne; which defaute of peyne, thou hast graunted, is yvel for         90
  the deserte of felonye.' 'I ne may nat denye it,' quod I. 'Moche
  more thanne,' quod she, 'ben shrewes unsely, whan they ben
  wrongfully delivered fro peyne, than whan they ben punisshed by
  rightful veniaunce. But this is open thing and cleer, that it is
  right that shrewes ben punisshed, and it is wikkednesse and            95
  wrong that they escapen unpunisshed.'

  'Who mighte deneye that?' quod I.

  'But,' quod she, 'may any man denye that al that is right nis
  good; and also the contrarie, that al that is wrong is wikke?'

  'Certes,' quod I, 'these thinges ben clere y-nough; and that          100
  we han concluded a litel her-biforn. But I praye thee that thou
  telle me, yif thou acordest to leten no torment to sowles, after that
  the body is ended by the deeth;' _this is to seyn, understandestow
  aught that sowles han any torment after the deeth of the body?_

  'Certes,' quod she, 'ye; and that right greet; of which sowles,'      105
  quod she, 'I trowe that some ben tormented by asprenesse of
  peyne; and some sowles, I trowe, ben exercised by a purginge
  mekenesse. But my conseil nis nat to determinye of thise peynes.
  But I have travailed and told yit hiderto, for thou sholdest knowe
  that the mowinge of shrewes, which mowinge thee semeth to ben         110
  unworthy, nis no mowinge: and eek of shrewes, of which thou
  pleinedest that they ne were nat punisshed, that thou woldest
  seen that they ne weren never-mo with-outen the torments of hir
  wikkednesse: and of the licence _of the mowinge to don yvel_,
  that thou preydest that it mighte sone ben ended, and that thou       115
  woldest fayn lernen that it ne sholde nat longe dure: and that
  shrewes ben more unsely yif they were of lenger duringe, and
  most unsely yif they weren perdurable. And after this, I have
  shewed thee that more unsely ben shrewes, whan they escapen
  with-oute hir rightful peyne, than whan they ben punisshed by         120
  rightful veniaunce. And of this sentence folweth it, that thanne
  ben shrewes constreined at the laste with most grevous torment,
  whan men wene that they ne be nat punisshed.'

  'Whan I consider thy resouns,' quod I, 'I ne trowe nat that
  men seyn any-thing more verayly. And yif I torne ayein to the         125
  studies of men, who is he to whom it sholde seme that he ne
  sholde nat only leven thise thinges, but eek gladly herkne
  hem?'

  'Certes,' quod she, 'so it is; but men may nat. For they han
  hir eyen so wont to the derknesse _of erthely thinges_, that they ne  130
  may nat liften hem up to the light of cleer sothfastnesse; but
  they ben lyke to briddes, of which the night lightneth hir lokinge,
  and the day blindeth hem. For whan men loken nat the ordre of
  thinges, but hir lustes and talents, they wene that either the leve
  or the mowinge to don wikkednesse, or elles the scapinge with-oute    135
  peyne, be weleful. But consider the Iugement of the
  perdurable lawe. For yif thou conferme thy corage to the beste
  thinges, thou ne hast no nede of no Iuge to yeven thee prys or
  mede; for thou hast ioyned thy-self to the most excellent thing.
  And yif thou have enclyned thy studies to the wikked thinges, ne      140
  seek no foreyne wreker out of thy-self; for thou thy-self hast
  thrist thy-self in-to wikke thinges: right as thou mightest loken by
  dyverse tymes the foule erthe and the hevene, and that alle other
  thinges stinten fro with-oute, _so that thou nere neither in hevene
  ne in erthe, ne saye no-thing more_; than it sholde semen to          145
  thee, as by only resoun of lokinge, that thou were now in the
  sterres and now in the erthe. But the poeple ne loketh nat on
  thise thinges. What thanne? Shal we thanne aprochen us to
  hem that I have shewed that they ben lyk to bestes? And what
  woltow seyn of this: yif that a man hadde al forlorn his sighte       150
  and hadde foryeten that he ever saugh, and wende that no-thing
  ne faylede him of perfeccioun of mankinde, now we that mighten
  seen the same thinges, wolde we nat wene that he were blinde?
  Ne also ne acordeth nat the poeple to that I shal seyn, the which
  thing is sustened by a stronge foundement of resouns, _that is to_    155
  _seyn_, that more unsely ben they that don wrong to othre folk
  than they that the wrong suffren.'

  'I wolde heren thilke same resouns,' quod I.

  'Denyestow,' quod she, 'that alle shrewes ne ben worthy to
  han torment?'                                                         160

  'Nay,' quod I.

  'But,' quod she, 'I am certein, by many resouns, that shrewes
  ben unsely.'

  'It acordeth,' quod I.

  'Thanne ne doutestow nat,' quod she, 'that thilke folk that ben       165
  worthy of torment, that they ne ben wrecches?'

  'It acordeth wel,' quod I.

  'Yif thou were thanne,' quod she, 'y-set a Iuge or a knower of
  thinges, whether, trowestow, that men sholden tormenten him
  that hath don the wrong, or elles him that hath suffred the           170
  wrong?'

  'I ne doute nat,' quod I, 'that I nolde don suffisaunt satisfaccioun
  to him that hadde suffred the wrong by the sorwe of him
  that hadde don the wrong.'

  'Thanne semeth it,' quod she, 'that the doere of wrong is             175
  more wrecche than he that suffred wrong?'

  'That folweth wel,' quod I.

  'Than,' quod she, 'by these causes and by othre causes that
  ben enforced by the same rote, filthe or sinne, by the propre
  nature of it, maketh men wrecches; and it sheweth wel, that the       180
  wrong that men don nis nat the wrecchednesse of him that
  receyveth the wrong, but the wrecchednesse of him that doth the
  wrong. But certes,' quod she, 'thise oratours or advocats don al
  the contrarye; for they enforcen hem to commoeve the Iuges to
  han pitee of hem that han suffred and receyved the thinges that       185
  ben grevous and aspre, and yit men sholden more rightfully han
  pitee of hem that don the grevaunces and the wronges; the
  whiche shrewes, it were a more covenable thing, that the
  accusours or advocats, nat wroth but pitous and debonair, ledden
  tho shrewes that han don wrong to the Iugement, right as men          190
  leden syke folk to the leche, for that they sholde seken out the
  maladyes of sinne by torment. And by this covenaunt, either the
  entente of deffendours or advocats sholde faylen and cesen in al,
  or elles, yif the office of advocats wolde bettre profiten to men,
  it sholde ben torned in-to the habite of accusacioun; _that is to     195
  seyn, they sholden accuse shrewes, and nat excuse hem_. And eek
  the shrewes hem-self, yif hit were leveful to hem to seen at any
  clifte the vertu that they han forleten, and sawen that they
  sholden putten adoun the filthes of hir vyces, by the torments of
  peynes, they ne oughte nat, right for the recompensacioun for to      200
  geten hem bountee and prowesse which that they han lost,
  demen ne holden that thilke peynes weren torments to hem; and
  eek they wolden refuse the attendaunce of hir advocats, and
  taken hem-self to hir Iuges and to hir accusors. For which it
  bitydeth that, as to the wyse folk, ther nis no place y-leten to      205
  hate; _that is to seyn, that ne hate hath no place amonges wyse men_.
  For no wight nil haten goode men, but-yif he were over-mochel a
  fool; and for to haten shrewes, it nis no resoun. For right so as
  languissinge is maladye of body, right so ben vyces and sinne
  maladye of corage. And so as we ne deme nat, that they that ben       210
  syke of hir body ben worthy to ben hated, but rather worthy of
  pitee: wel more worthy, nat to ben hated, but for to ben had in
  pitee, ben they of whiche the thoughtes ben constreined by
  felonous wikkednesse, that is more cruel than any languissinge of     215
  body.

  'Thus see I wel,' quod I, 'either what blisfulnesse or elles
  what unselinesse is establisshed in the desertes of goode men and

  good and somwhat of yvel. For no wyse man hath lever ben

  is the office of wyse men y-treted, whan the blisfulnesse and
  the poustee of governours is, as it were, y-shad amonges poeples
  that be neighebours _and subgits_; sin that, namely, prisoun, lawe,    10
  and thise othre torments of laweful peynes ben rather owed to
  felonous citezeins, for the whiche felonous citezeins tho peynes
  ben establisshed, _than for good folk_. Thanne I mervaile me

  that torments of felonyes pressen and confounden goode folk, and       15
  shrewes ravisshen medes of vertu, _and ben in honours and in

PROSE VI.

_Ita est, inquam._

  'Thus is it,' quod I. 'But so as thou hast yeven or bi-hight
  me to unwrappen the hid causes of thinges, and to discovere me
  the resouns covered with derknesses, I prey thee that thou devyse
  and iuge me of this matere, and that thou do me to understonden
  it; for this miracle or this wonder troubleth me right gretly.'         5

  And thanne she, a litel what smylinge, seyde: 'thou clepest
  me,' quod she, 'to telle thing that is grettest of alle thinges that
  mowen ben axed, and to the whiche questioun unnethes is ther
  aught y-nough to laven it; _as who seyth, unnethes is ther suffisauntly
  anything to answere parfitly to thy questioun_. For the                10
  matere of it is swich, that whan o doute is determined and cut
  awey, ther wexen other doutes with-oute number; right as the
  hevedes wexen of Ydre, _the serpent that Ercules slowh_. Ne ther
  ne were no manere ne non ende, but-yif that a wight constreinede
  tho doutes by a right lyfly and quik fyr of thought; _that is to_      15
  _seyn, by vigour and strengthe of wit_. For in this manere men
  weren wont to maken questions of the simplicitee of the purviaunce
  of god, and of the order of destinee, and of sodein
  happe, and of the knowinge and predestinacioun divyne, and of
  the libertee of free wille; the whiche thinges thou thy-self           20
  aperceyvest wel, of what weight they ben. But for as mochel
  as the knowinge of thise thinges is a maner porcioun of the
  medicine of thee, al-be-it so that I have litel tyme to don it,
  yit natheles I wol enforcen me to shewe somwhat of it. But
  al-thogh the norisshinges of ditee of musike delyteth thee, thou       25
  most suffren and forberen a litel of thilke delyte, whyle that
  I weve to thee resouns y-knit by ordre.'

  'As it lyketh to thee,' quod I, 'so do.' Tho spak she right as
  by another biginninge, and seyde thus. 'The engendringe of
  alle thinges,' quod she, 'and alle the progressiouns of muable         30
  nature, and al that moeveth in any manere, taketh his causes, his
  ordre, and his formes, of the stablenesse of the divyne thoght;
  and thilke divyne thought, that is y-set and put in the tour, _that
  is to seyn, in the heighte_, of the simplicitee of god, stablissheth
  many maner gyses to thinges that ben to done; the whiche               35
  maner, whan that men loken it in thilke pure clennesse of the
  divyne intelligence, it is y-cleped purviaunce; but whan thilke
  maner is referred by men to thinges that it moveth and disponeth,
  thanne of olde men it was cleped destinee. The whiche thinges,
  yif that any wight loketh wel in his thought the strengthe of that     40
  oon and of that other, he shal lightly mowen seen, that thise two
  thinges ben dyverse. For purviaunce is thilke divyne reson that
  is establisshed in the soverein prince of thinges; the whiche purviaunce
  disponeth alle thinges. But destinee is the disposicioun
  and ordinaunce clyvinge to moevable thinges, by the whiche             45
  disposicioun the purviaunce knitteth alle thinges in hir ordres;
  for purviaunce embraceth alle thinges to-hepe, al-thogh that they
  ben dyverse, and al-thogh they ben infinite; but destinee departeth
  and ordeineth alle thinges singulerly, and divyded in
  moevinges, in places, in formes, in tymes, as thus: lat the            50
  unfoldinge of temporel ordinaunce, assembled and ooned in the
  lokinge of the divyne thought, be cleped purviaunce; and thilke
  same assemblinge and ooninge, divyded and unfolden by tymes,
  lat that ben called destinee. And al-be-it so that thise thinges
  ben dyverse, yit natheles hangeth that oon on that other; for-why      55
  the order destinal procedeth of the simplicitee of purviaunce.
  For right as a werkman, that aperceyveth in his thoght the forme
  of the thing that he wol make, and moeveth the effect of the
  werk, and ledeth that he hadde loked biforn in his thoght simply
  and presently, by temporel ordinaunce: certes, right so god            60
  disponeth in his purviaunce, singulerly and stably, the thinges
  that ben to done, but he aministreth in many maneres and in
  dyverse tymes, by destinee, thilke same thinges that he hath
  disponed.

  Thanne, whether that destinee be exercysed outher by some              65
  divyne spirits, servaunts to the divyne purviaunce, or elles by
  som sowle, or elles by alle nature servinge to god, or elles by the
  celestial moevinges of sterres, or elles by the vertu of angeles, or
  elles by the dyverse subtilitee of develes, or elles by any of hem,
  or elles by hem alle, the destinal ordinaunce is y-woven and           70
  acomplisshed. Certes, it is open thing, that the purviaunce is
  an unmoevable and simple forme of thinges to done; and the
  moveable bond and the temporel ordinaunce of thinges, whiche
  that the divyne simplicitee of purviaunce hath ordeyned to done,
  that is destinee. For which it is, that alle thinges that ben put      75
  under destinee ben, certes, subgits to purviaunce, to whiche purviaunce
  destinee itself is subgit and under. But some thinges
  ben put under purviaunce, that surmounten the ordinaunce of
  destinee; and tho ben thilke that stably ben y-ficched negh to the
  firste godhed: they surmounten the ordre of destinal moevabletee.      80
  For right as of cercles that tornen a-boute a same centre or a-boute
  a poynt, thilke cercle that is innerest or most with-inne ioyneth to
  the simplesse of the middel, and is, as it were, a centre or a poynt
  to that other cercles that tornen a-bouten him; and thilke that is
  outterest, compassed by larger envyronninge, is unfolden by            85
  larger spaces, in so moche as it is forthest fro the middel simplicitee
  of the poynt; and yif ther be any-thing that knitteth and
  felawshippeth him-self to thilke middel poynt, it is constreined
  in-to simplicitee, _that is to seyn, in-to unmoevabletee_, and it ceseth
  to be shad and to fleten dyversely: right so, by semblable resoun,     90
  thilke thing that departeth forthest fro the first thoght of god, it is
  unfolden and summitted to gretter bondes of destinee: and in so
  moche is the thing more free and laus fro destinee, as it axeth and
  holdeth him ner to thilke centre of thinges, _that is to seyn, god_.
  And yif the thing clyveth to the stedefastnesse of the thoght of god,  95
  and be with-oute moevinge, certes, it sormounteth the necessitee of
  destinee. Thanne right swich comparisoun as it is of skilinge to
  understondinge, and of thing that is engendred to thing that is, and
  of tyme to eternitee, and of the cercle to the centre, right so is the
  ordre of moevable destinee to the stable simplicitee of purviaunce.   100

  Thilke ordinaunce moeveth the hevene and the sterres, and
  atempreth the elements to-gider amonges hem-self, and transformeth
  hem by entrechaungeable mutacioun; and thilke same
  ordre neweth ayein alle thinges growinge and fallinge a-doun, by
  semblable progressiouns of sedes and of sexes, _that is to seyn,      105
  male and femele_. And this ilke ordre constreineth the fortunes and
  the dedes of men by a bond of causes, nat able to ben unbounde;
  the whiche destinal causes, whan they passen out fro the biginninges
  of the unmoevable purviaunce, it mot nedes be that they
  ne be nat mutable. And thus ben the thinges ful wel y-governed,       110
  yif that the simplicitee dwellinge in the divyne thoght sheweth
  forth the ordre of causes, unable to ben y-bowed; and this ordre
  constreineth by his propre stabletee the moevable thinges, or elles
  they sholden fleten folily. For which it is, that alle thinges semen
  to ben confus and trouble to us men, for we ne mowen nat considere    115
  thilke ordinaunce; natheles, the propre maner of every
  thinge, dressinge hem to goode, disponeth hem alle.

  For ther nis no-thing don for cause of yvel; ne thilke thing
  that is don by wikkede folk _nis nat don for yvel_. The whiche
  shrewes, as I have shewed ful plentivously, seken good, but           120
  wikked errour mistorneth hem, ne the ordre cominge fro the
  poynt of soverein good ne declyneth nat fro his biginninge. But
  thou mayst seyn, what unreste may ben a worse confusioun than
  that gode men han somtyme adversitee and somtyme prosperitee,
  and shrewes also now han thinges that they desiren, and now           125
  thinges that they haten? Whether men liven now in swich
  hoolnesse of thoght, (_as who seyth, ben men now so wyse_), that
  swiche folk as they demen to ben gode folk or shrewes, that
  it moste nedes ben that folk ben swiche as they wenen? But in
  this manere the domes of men discorden, that thilke men that          130
  some folk demen worthy of mede, other folk demen hem worthy of
  torment. But lat us graunte, I pose that som man may wel demen
  or knowen the gode folk and the badde; may he thanne knowen
  and seen thilke innereste atempraunce of corages, as it hath ben
  wont to be seyd of bodies; _as who seyth, may a man speken and        135
  determinen of atempraunces in corages, as men were wont to demen or
  speken of complexiouns and atempraunces of bodies?_ Ne it ne is nat
  an unlyk miracle, to hem that ne knowen it nat, (_as who seith, but it
  is lyke a merveil or a miracle to hem that ne knowen it nat_), why that
  swete thinges ben covenable to some bodies that ben hole, and to      140
  some bodies bittere thinges ben covenable; and also, why that
  some syke folk ben holpen with lighte medicynes, and some folk
  ben holpen with sharpe medicynes. But natheles, the leche that
  knoweth the manere and the atempraunce of hele and of maladye,
  ne merveileth of it no-thing. But what other thing semeth hele        145
  of corages but bountee and prowesse? And what other thing
  semeth maladye _of corages_ but vyces? Who is elles kepere of
  good or dryver awey of yvel, but god, governour and lecher of
  thoughtes? The whiche god, whan he hath biholden from the
  heye tour of his purveaunce, he knoweth what is covenable to          150
  every wight, and leneth hem that he wot that is covenable to hem.
  Lo, her-of comth and her-of is don this noble miracle of the ordre
  destinal, whan god, that al knoweth, doth swiche thing, of which
  thing that unknowinge folk ben astoned. But for to constreine,
  _as who seyth, but for to comprehende and telle_ a fewe thinges of
      the                                                               155
  divyne deepnesse, the whiche that mannes resoun may understonde,
  thilke man that thou wenest to ben right Iuste and right
  kepinge of equitee, the contrarie of that semeth to the divyne
  purveaunce, that al wot. And Lucan, my familer, telleth that
  "the victorious cause lykede to the goddes, and the cause over-comen  160
  lykede to Catoun." Thanne, what-so-ever thou mayst seen
  that is don in this werld unhoped or unwened, certes, it is the
  right ordre of thinges; but, as to thy wikkede opinioun, it is a
  confusioun. But I suppose that som man be so wel y-thewed,
  that the divyne Iugement and the Iugement of mankinde acorden         165
  hem to-gider of him; but he is so unstedefast of corage, that, yif
  any adversitee come to him, he wol forleten, par-aventure, to
  continue innocence, by the whiche he ne may nat with-holden
  fortune. Thanne the wyse dispensacioun of god spareth him, the
  whiche man adversitee mighte enpeyren; for that god wol nat           170
  suffren him to travaile, to whom that travaile nis nat covenable.
  Another man is parfit in alle vertues, and is an holy man, and
  negh to god, so that the purviaunce of god wolde demen, that
  it were a felonye that he were touched with any adversitees; so
  that he wol nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with any            175
  bodily maladye. But so as seyde a philosophre, the more excellent
  by me: _he seyde in Grek_, that "vertues han edified the body
  of the holy man." And ofte tyme it bitydeth, that the somme of
  thinges that ben to done is taken to governe to gode folk, for that
  the malice haboundaunt of shrewes sholde ben abated. And god          180
  yeveth and departeth to othre folk prosperitees and adversitees
  y-medled to-hepe, after the qualitee of hir corages, and remordeth
  som folk _by adversitee_, for they ne sholde nat wexen proude by
  longe welefulnesse. And other folk he suffreth to ben travailed
  with harde thinges, for that they sholden confermen the vertues       185
  of corage by the usage and exercitacioun of pacience. And
  other folk dreden more than they oughten [that] whiche they
  mighten wel beren; and somme dispyse that they mowe nat
  beren; and thilke folk god ledeth in-to experience of himself by
  aspre and sorwful thinges. And many othre folk han bought             190
  honourable renoun of this world by the prys of glorious deeth.
  And som men, that ne mowen nat ben overcomen by torments,
  have yeven ensaumple to othre folk, that vertu may nat ben overcomen
  by adversitees; and of alle thinges ther nis no doute, that
  they ne ben don rightfully and ordenely, to the profit of hem to      195
  whom we seen thise thinges bityde. For certes, that adversitee
  comth somtyme to shrewes, and somtyme that that they desiren,
  it comth of thise forseide causes. And of sorwful thinges _that
  bityden to shrewes_, certes, no man ne wondreth; for alle men
  wenen that they han wel deserved it, and that they ben of             200
  wikkede merite; of whiche shrewes the torment somtyme agasteth
  othre to don felonyes, and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffren
  the torments. And the prosperitee _that is yeven to shrewes_
  sheweth a greet argument to gode folk, what thing they sholde
  demen of thilke welefulnesse, the whiche prosperitee men seen         205
  ofte serven to shrewes. In the which thing I trowe that god
  dispenseth; for, per-aventure, the nature of som man is so overthrowinge
  _to yvel_, and so uncovenable, that the nedy povertee of
  his houshold mighte rather egren him to don felonyes. And to
  the maladye of him god putteth remedie, to yeven him richesses.       210
  And som other man biholdeth his conscience defouled with sinnes,
  and maketh comparisoun of his fortune and of him-self; and
  dredeth, per-aventure, that his blisfulnesse, of which the usage is
  Ioyeful to him, that the lesinge of thilke blisfulnesse ne be nat
  sorwful to him; and therfor he wol chaunge his maneres, and, for      215
  he dredeth to lese his fortune, he forleteth his wikkednesse. To
  othre folk is welefulnesse y-yeven unworthily, the whiche overthroweth
  hem in-to distruccioun that they han deserved. And to
  som othre folk is yeven power to punisshen, for that it shal be
  cause of _continuacioun and_ exercysinge to gode folk and cause of    220
  torment to shrewes. For so as ther nis non alyaunce by-twixe
  gode folk and shrewes, ne shrewes ne mowen nat acorden amonges
  hem-self. And why nat? For shrewes discorden of hem-self by
  hir vyces, the whiche vyces al to-renden hir consciences; and don
  ofte tyme thinges, the whiche thinges, whan they han don hem,         225
  they demen that tho thinges ne sholden nat han ben don. For
  which thing thilke soverein purveaunce hath maked ofte tyme fair
  miracle; so that shrewes han maked shrewes to ben gode men.
  For whan that som shrewes seen that they suffren wrongfully
  felonyes of othre shrewes, they wexen eschaufed in-to hate of hem     230
  that anoyeden hem, and retornen to the frut of vertu, whan they
  studien to ben unlyk to hem that they han hated. Certes, only
  this is the divyne might, to the whiche might yveles ben thanne
  gode, whan it useth tho yveles covenably, and draweth out the
  effect of any gode; _as who seyth, that yvel is good only to the
      might                                                             235
  of god, for the might of god ordeyneth thilke yvel to good_.

  For oon ordre embraseth alle thinges, so that what wight that
  departeth fro the resoun of thilke ordre which that is assigned to
  him, algates yit he slydeth in-to another ordre, so that no-thing
  nis leveful to folye in the reame of the divyne purviaunce; _as who   240
  seyth, nothing nis with-outen ordinaunce in the reame of the divyne
  purviaunce_; sin that the right stronge god governeth alle thinges
  in this world. For it nis nat leveful to man to comprehenden by
  wit, ne unfolden by word, alle the subtil ordinaunces and disposiciouns
  of the divyne entente. For only it oughte suffise to                  245
  han loked, that god him-self, maker of alle natures, ordeineth and
  dresseth alle thinges to gode; whyl that he hasteth to with-holden
  the thinges that he hath maked in-to his semblaunce, _that is to
  seyn, for to with-holden thinges in-to good, for he him-self is good_,
  he chaseth out al yvel fro the boundes of his comunalitee by the      250
  ordre of necessitee destinable. For which it folweth, that yif thou
  loke the purviaunce ordeininge the thinges that men wenen ben
  outrageous or haboundant in erthes, thou ne shalt nat seen in no
  place no-thing of yvel. But I see now that thou art charged with
  the weighte of the questioun, and wery with the lengthe of my         255
  resoun; and that thou abydest som sweetnesse of songe. Tak

_Si uis celsi iura tonantis._

  If thou, wys, wilt demen in thy pure thought the rightes or the
  lawes of the heye thonderer, _that is to seyn, of god_, loke thou and
  bihold the heightes of the soverein hevene. There kepen the
  sterres, by rightful alliaunce of thinges, hir olde pees. The sonne,
  y-moeved by his rody fyr, ne distorbeth nat the colde cercle of         5
  the mone. Ne the sterre y-cleped "the Bere," that enclyneth his
  ravisshinge courses abouten the soverein heighte of the worlde, ne
  the same sterre Ursa nis never-mo wasshen in the depe westrene
  see, ne coveiteth nat to deyen his flaumbes in the see of the occian,
  al-thogh he see othre sterres y-plounged in the see. And Hesperus      10
  _the sterre_ bodeth and telleth alwey the late nightes; and Lucifer
  _the sterre_ bringeth ayein the clere day.

  And thus maketh Love entrechaungeable the perdurable courses;
  and thus is discordable bataile y-put out of the contree of the
  sterres. This acordaunce atempreth by evenelyk maneres the             15
  elements, that the moiste thinges, stryvinge with the drye thinges,
  yeven place by stoundes; and the colde thinges ioynen hem by
  feyth to the hote thinges; and that the lighte fyr aryseth in-to
  heighte; and the hevy erthes avalen by hir weightes. By thise
  same causes the floury yeer yildeth swote smelles in the firste        20
  somer-sesoun warminge; and the hote somer dryeth the cornes;
  and autumpne comth ayein, hevy of apples; and the fletinge reyn
  bideweth the winter. This atempraunce norissheth and bringeth
  forth al thing that [bretheth] lyf in this world; and thilke same
  atempraunce, ravisshinge, hydeth and binimeth, and drencheth           25
  under the laste deeth, alle thinges y-born.

  Amonges thise thinges sitteth the heye maker, king and lord,
  welle and biginninge, lawe and wys Iuge, to don equitee; and
  governeth and enclyneth the brydles of thinges. And tho thinges
  that he stereth to gon by moevinge, he withdraweth and aresteth;       30
  and affermeth the moevable or wandringe thinges. For yif that
  he ne clepede ayein the right goinge of thinges, and yif that he ne
  constreinede hem nat eft-sones in-to roundnesses enclynede, the
  thinges that ben now continued by stable ordinaunce, they sholden
  departen from hir welle, _that is to seyn, from hir biginninge_, and   35
  faylen, _that is to seyn, torne in-to nought_.

  This is the comune Love to alle thinges; and alle thinges axen
  to ben holden by the fyn of good. For elles ne mighten they nat
  lasten, yif they ne come nat eft-sones ayein, by Love retorned, to
  the cause that hath yeven hem beinge, _that is to seyn, to god_.       40

  'Certes,' quod she, 'al-outrely, that alle fortune is good.'

  'And how may that be?' quod I.

  'Now understand,' quod she, 'so as alle fortune, whether so it          5

  'Forsothe, this is a ful verray resoun,' quod I; 'and yif I consider
  the purviaunce and the destinee that thou taughtest me a
  litel her-biforn, this sentence is sustened by stedefast resouns.
  But yif it lyke unto thee, lat us noumbren hem amonges thilke
  thinges, of whiche thou seydest a litel her-biforn, that they ne were  15
  nat able to ben wened to the poeple.' 'Why so?' quod she.

  'For that the comune word of men,' quod I, 'misuseth this
  _maner speche of fortune_, and seyn ofte tymes that the fortune of
  som wight is wikkede.'

  'Wiltow thanne,' quod she, 'that I aproche a litel to the wordes       20

  as fro the usage of mankinde?'

  'As thou wolt,' quod I.

  'Demestow nat,' quod she, 'that al thing that profiteth is good?'

  'Yis,' quod I.                                                         25

  'And certes, thilke thing that exercyseth or corigeth, profiteth?'

  'I confesse it wel,' quod I.

  'Thanne is it good?' quod she.

  'Why nat?' quod I.

  'But this is the fortune,' quod she, 'of hem that either ben put       30
  in vertu and batailen ayeins aspre thinges, or elles of hem that
  eschuen and declynen fro vyces and taken the wey of vertu.'

  'This ne may I nat denye,' quod I.

  'But what seystow of the mery fortune that is yeven to good
  folk in guerdoun? Demeth aught the poeple that it is wikked?'          35

  'Nay, forsothe,' quod I; 'but they demen, as it sooth is, that it
  is right good.'

  'And what seystow of that other fortune,' quod she, 'that,
  al-thogh that it be aspre, and restreineth the shrewes by rightful
  torment, weneth aught the poeple that it be good?'                     40

  'Nay,' quod I, 'but the poeple demeth that it is most wrecched
  of alle thinges that may ben thought.'

  'War now, and loke wel,' quod she, 'lest that we, in folwinge
  the opinioun of the poeple, have confessed and concluded thing
  that is unable to be wened _to the poeple_.                            45

  'What is that?' quod I.

  'Certes,' quod she, 'it folweth or comth of thinges that ben
  graunted, that alle fortune, what-so-ever it be, of hem that ben
  either in possessioun of vertu, or in the encres of vertu, or elles in
  the purchasinge of vertu, that thilke fortune is good; and that alle   50
  fortune is right wikkede to hem that dwellen in shrewednesse;' _as
  who seyth, and thus weneth nat the poeple_.

  'That is sooth,' quod I, 'al-be-it so that no man dar confesse it
  ne biknowen it.'

  'Why so?' quod she; 'for right as the stronge man ne semeth            55
  nat to abaissen or disdaignen as ofte tyme as he hereth the noise
  of the bataile, ne also it ne semeth nat, to the wyse man, to beren

  and to that other man, to confirme his sapience, _that is to seyn, to

  that it susteneth and enforseth, by hise strengthes, that it nis nat

  _in wrekinge_, by the destruccioun of Troye, the loste chaumbres of

  Hercules is celebrable for his harde travailes; he dauntede the        20

  rafte him his skin_. He smoot the briddes _that highten Arpyes_

  and his hand was the more hevy for the goldene metal.                  25

BOOK V.


PROSE I.

_Dixerat, orationisque cursum._

  She hadde seyd, and torned the cours of hir resoun to some
  othre thinges to ben treted and to ben y-sped. Thanne seyde I,
  'Certes, rightful is thyn amonestinge and ful digne by auctoritee.
  But that thou seidest whylom, that the questioun of the divyne
  purviaunce is enlaced with many other questiouns, I understonde         5
  wel and proeve it by the same thing. But I axe yif that thou
  wenest that hap be any thing in any weys; and, yif thou wenest
  that hap be anything, what is it?'

  Thanne quod she, 'I haste me to yilden and assoilen to thee
  the dette of my bihest, and to shewen and opnen the wey, by            10
  which wey thou mayst come ayein to thy contree. But al-be-it
  so that the thinges which that thou axest ben right profitable to
  knowe, yit ben they diverse somwhat fro the path of my purpos;
  and it is to douten that thou ne be maked wery by mis-weyes, so
  that thou ne mayst nat suffyce to mesuren the right wey.'              15

  'Ne doute thee ther-of nothing,' quod I. 'For, for to knowen
  thilke thinges to-gedere, in the whiche thinges I delyte me greetly,
  that shal ben to me in stede of reste; sin it is nat to douten of
  the thinges folwinge, whan every syde of thy disputacioun shal han
  be stedefast to me by undoutous feith.'                                20

  Thanne seyde she, 'That manere wol I don thee'; and bigan
  to speken right thus. 'Certes,' quod she, 'yif any wight diffinisshe
  hap in this manere, that is to seyn, that "hap is bitydinge
  y-brought forth by foolish moevinge and by no knettinge of
  causes," I conferme that hap nis right naught in no wyse; and I        25
  deme al-outrely that hap nis, ne dwelleth but a voice, _as who seith,
  but an ydel word_, with-outen any significacioun of thing submitted
  to that vois. For what place mighte ben left, or dwellinge,
  to folye and to disordenaunce, sin that god ledeth and constreineth
  alle thinges by ordre? For this sentence is verray and                 30
  sooth, that "nothing ne hath his beinge of naught"; to the
  whiche sentence none of thise olde folk ne withseyde never; al-be-it
  so that they ne understoden ne meneden it naught by god,
  prince and beginnere of werkinge, but they casten [it] as a manere
  foundement of subiect material, that is to seyn, of the nature of      35
  alle resoun. And yif that any thing is woxen or comen of no
  causes, than shal it seme that thilke thing is comen or woxen of
  naught; but yif this ne may nat ben don, thanne is it nat possible,
  that hap be any swich thing as I have diffinisshed a litel heer-biforn.'

  'How shal it thanne be?' quod I. 'Nis ther thanne no-thing             40
  that by right may be cleped either "hap" or elles "aventure of
  fortune"; or is ther aught, al-be-it so that it is hid fro the peple,
  to which these wordes ben covenable?'

  'Myn Aristotulis,' quod she, 'in the book of his Phisik, diffinissheth
  this thing by short resoun, and neigh to the sothe.'                   45

  'In which manere?' quod I.

  'As ofte,' quod she, 'as men doon any thing for grace of any
  other thing, and an-other thing than thilke thing that men
  entenden to don bitydeth by some causes, it is cleped "hap."
  Right as a man dalf the erthe by cause of tilyinge of the feeld,       50
  and founde ther a gobet of gold bidolven, thanne wenen folk that
  it is bifalle by fortunous bitydinge. But, for sothe, it nis nat of
  naught, for it hath his propre causes; of whiche causes the cours
  unforeseyn and unwar semeth to han maked hap. For yif the
  tilyere of the feld ne dolve nat in the erthe, and yif the hyder of    55
  the gold ne hadde hid the gold in thilke place, the gold ne hadde
  nat been founde. Thise ben thanne the causes of the abregginge
  of fortuit hap, the which abregginge of fortuit hap comth of causes
  encountringe and flowinge to-gidere to hem-self, and nat by the
  entencioun of the doer. For neither the hyder of the gold ne the       60
  delver of the feeld ne understoden nat that the gold sholde han
  ben founde; but, as I sayde, it bitidde and ran to-gidere that he
  dalf ther-as that other hadde hid the gold. Now may I thus
  diffinisshe "hap." Hap is an unwar bitydinge of causes assembled
  in thinges that ben don for som other thing. But thilke ordre,         65
  procedinge by an uneschuable bindinge to-gidere, which that
  descendeth fro the welle of purviaunce that ordeineth alle thinges
  in hir places and in hir tymes, maketh that the causes rennen and
  assemblen to-gidere.

_Animaduerto, inquam._

  'This understonde I wel,' quod I, 'and I acorde wel that it is
  right as thou seyst. But I axe yif ther be any libertee of free wil
  in this ordre of causes that clyven thus to-gidere in hem-self; or
  elles I wolde witen yif that the destinal cheyne constreineth the
  movinges of the corages of men?'                                        5

  'Yis,' quod she; 'ther is libertee of free wil. Ne ther ne was
  nevere no nature of resoun that it ne hadde libertee of free wil.
  For every thing that may naturely usen resoun, it hath doom by
  which it decerneth and demeth every thing; thanne knoweth it,
  by it-self, thinges that ben to fleen and thinges that ben to desiren. 10
  And thilke thing that any wight demeth to ben desired, that axeth
  or desireth he; and fleeth thilke thing that he troweth ben to
  fleen. Wherfore in alle thinges that resoun is, in hem also is
  libertee of willinge and of nillinge. But I ne ordeyne nat, _as who
  seyth, I ne graunte nat_, that this libertee be evene-lyk in alle      15
  thinges. Forwhy in the sovereines devynes substaunces, _that is
  to seyn, in spirits_, Iugement is more cleer, and wil nat y-corumped,
  and might redy to speden thinges that ben desired. But the
  soules of men moten nedes be more free whan they loken hem in
  the speculacioun or lokinge of the devyne thought, and lasse free      20
  whan they slyden in-to the bodies; and yit lasse free whan they
  ben gadered to-gidere and comprehended in erthely membres.
  But the laste servage is whan that they ben yeven to vyces, and
  han y-falle from the possessioun of hir propre resoun. For after
  that they han cast awey hir eyen fro the light of the sovereyn         25

  the cloude of ignoraunce and ben troubled by felonous talents; to
  the whiche talents whan they aprochen and asenten, they hepen
  and encresen the servage which they han ioyned to hem-self; and
  in this manere they ben caitifs fro hir propre libertee. The whiche    30
  thinges, nathelesse, the lokinge of the devyne purviaunce seeth,
  that alle thinges biholdeth and seeth fro eterne, and ordeineth

_Tum ego, en, inquam._

  Thanne seyde I, 'now am I confounded by a more hard doute
  than I was.'

  'What doute is that?' quod she. 'For certes, I coniecte now
  by whiche thinges thou art troubled.'

  'It semeth,' quod I, 'to repugnen and to contrarien greetly,            5
  that god knoweth biforn alle thinges, and that ther is any freedom
  of libertee. For yif so be that god loketh alle thinges biforn, ne
  god ne may nat ben desseived in no manere, than mot it nedes
  been, that alle thinges bityden the whiche that the purviaunce of
  god hath seyn biforn to comen. For which, yif that god                 10
  knoweth biforn nat only the werkes of men, but also hir conseiles
  and hir willes, thanne ne shal ther be no libertee of arbitre; ne,
  certes, ther ne may be noon other dede, ne no wil, but thilke
  which that the divyne purviaunce, that may nat ben desseived,
  hath feled biforn. For yif that they mighten wrythen awey in           15
  othre manere than they ben purveyed, than sholde ther be no
  stedefast prescience of thing to comen, but rather an uncertein
  opinioun; the whiche thing to trowen of god, I deme it felonye
  and unleveful. Ne I ne proeve nat thilke same resoun, _as who
  seyth, I ne alowe nat, or I ne preyse nat, thilke same resoun_, by     20
  which that som men wenen that they mowen assoilen and
  unknitten the knotte of this questioun. For, certes, they seyn
  that thing nis nat to comen for that the purviaunce of god hath
  seyn it biforn that is to comen, but rather the contrarye, _and that
  is this_: that, for that the thing is to comen, therfore ne may it     25
  nat ben hid fro the purviaunce of god; and in this manere this
  necessitee slydeth ayein in-to the contrarye partye: ne it ne
  bihoveth nat, nedes, that thinges bityden that ben purvyed, but
  it bihoveth, nedes, that thinges that ben to comen ben y-porveyed:
  but as it were y-travailed, _as who seyth, that thilke answere_        30
  _procedeth right as thogh men travaileden, or weren bisy to enqueren_,
  the whiche thing is cause of the whiche thing:--as, whether the
  prescience is cause of the necessitee of thinges to comen, or elles
  that the necessitee of thinges to comen is cause of the purviaunce.
  But I ne enforce me nat now to shewen it, that the bitydinge of        35
  thinges y-wist biforn is necessarie, how so or in what manere
  that the ordre of causes hath it-self; al-thogh that it ne seme nat
  that the prescience bringe in necessitee of bitydinge to thinges to
  comen. For certes, yif that any wight sitteth, it bihoveth by
  necessitee that the opinioun be sooth of him that coniecteth that      40
  he sitteth; and ayeinward also is it of the contrarye: yif the
  opinioun be sooth of any wight for that he sitteth, it bihoveth by
  necessitee that he sitte. Thanne is heer necessitee in that oon
  and in that other: for in that oon is necessitee of sittinge, and,
  certes, in that other is necessitee of sooth. But therfore ne          45
  sitteth nat a wight, for that the opinioun of the sittinge is sooth;
  but the opinioun is rather sooth, for that a wight sitteth biforn.
  And thus, al-thogh that the cause of the sooth cometh of that
  other syde (_as who seyth, that al-thogh the cause of sooth comth_
  _of the sitting, and nat of the trewe opinioun_), algates yit is ther  50
  comune necessitee in that oon and in that other. Thus sheweth
  it, that I may make semblable skiles of the purviaunce of god
  and of thinges to comen. For althogh that, for that thinges ben
  to comen, ther-fore ben they purveyed, nat, certes, for that they
  ben purveyed, ther-fore ne bityde they nat. Yit natheles,              55
  bihoveth it by necessitee, that either the thinges to comen ben
  y-purveyed of god, or elles that the thinges that ben purveyed of
  god bityden. And this thing only suffiseth y-nough to destroyen
  the freedom of oure arbitre, _that is to seyn, of oure free wil_. But
  now, certes, _sheweth it wel, how fer fro the sothe and_ how
      up-so-doun                                                         60
  is this thing that we seyn, that the bitydinge of temporel
  thinges is cause of the eterne prescience. But for to wenen that
  god purvyeth the thinges to comen for they ben to comen, what
  other thing is it but for to wene that thilke thinges that bitidden
  whylom ben causes of thilke soverein purvyaunce _that is in god_?      65
  And her-to _I adde yit this thing_: that, right as whan that I wot
  that a thing is, it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke selve thing be;
  and eek, whan I have knowe that any thing shal bityden, so
  byhoveth it by necessitee that thilke thing bityde:--so folweth it
  thanne, that the bitydinge of the thing y-wist biforn ne may nat       70
  ben eschued. And at the laste, yif that any wight wene a thing
  to ben other weyes thanne it is, it is nat only unscience, but it is
  deceivable opinioun ful diverse and fer fro the sothe of science.
  Wherfore, yif any thing be so to comen, that the bitydinge of hit
  ne be nat certein ne necessarie, who may weten biforn that thilke      75
  thing is to comen? For right as science ne may nat ben medled
  with falsnesse (_as who seyth, that yif I wot a thing, it ne may nat
  be false that I ne wot it_), right so thilke thing that is conceived by
  science ne may nat ben non other weys than as it is conceived.
  For that is the cause why that science wanteth lesing (_as who_        80
  _seyth, why that witinge ne receiveth nat lesinge of that it wot_); for
  it bihoveth, by necessitee, that every thing be right as science
  comprehendeth it to be. What shal I thanne seyn? In whiche
  manere knoweth god biforn the thinges to comen, yif they ne be
  nat certein? For yif that he deme that they ben to comen               85
  uneschewably, and so may be that it is possible that they ne
  shollen nat comen, god is deceived. But nat only to trowen that
  god is deceived, but for to speke it with mouth, it is a felonous
  sinne. But yif that god wot that, right so as thinges ben _to
  comen_, so shullen they comen--so that he wite egaly, _as who_         90
  _seyth, indifferently_, that thinges mowen ben doon or elles nat
  y-doon--what is thilke prescience that ne comprehendeth no
  certein thing ne stable? Or elles what difference is ther bitwixe
  the prescience and thilke Iape-worthy divyninge of Tiresie the
  divynour, _that seyde_: "Al that I seye," quod he, "either it shal be, 95
  or elles it ne shal nat be?" Or elles how mochel is worth the
  devyne prescience more than the opinioun of mankinde, yif so be
  that it demeth the thinges uncertein, as men doon; of the whiche
  domes of men the bitydinge nis nat certein? But yif so be that
  non uncertein thing ne may ben in him that is right certein welle     100
  of alle thinges, thanne is the bitydinge certein of thilke thinges
  whiche he hath wist biforn fermely to comen. For which it
  folweth, that the freedom of the conseiles and of the werkes of
  mankind nis non, sin that the thoght of god, that seeth alle
  thinges without errour of falsnesse, bindeth and constreineth         105
  hem to a bitydinge _by necessitee_. And yif this thing be ones
  y-graunted and received, _that is to seyn, that ther nis no free wille_,
  than sheweth it wel, how greet destruccioun and how grete
  damages ther folwen of thinges of mankinde. For in ydel ben
  ther thanne purposed and bihight medes to gode folk, and peynes       110
  to badde folk, sin that no moevinge of free corage voluntarie ne
  hath nat deserved hem, _that is to seyn, neither mede ne peyne_; and
  it sholde seme thanne, that thilke thing is alderworst, which that
  is now demed for aldermost iust and most rightful, _that is to seyn_,
  that shrewes ben punisshed, or elles that gode folk ben y-gerdoned:   115
  the whiche folk, sin that hir propre wil ne sent hem nat to that oon
  ne to that other, _that is to seyn, neither to gode ne to harm_, but
      constreineth
  hem certein necessitee of thinges to comen: thanne ne
  shollen ther nevere ben, ne nevere weren, vyce ne vertu, but it
  sholde rather ben confusioun of alle desertes medled with-outen       120
  discrecioun. And yit _ther folweth an-other inconvenient_, of the
  whiche ther ne may ben thoght no more felonous ne more wikke;
  _and that is this_: that, so as the ordre of thinges is y-led and
  comth of the purviaunce of god, ne that no-thing nis leveful to
  the conseiles of mankinde (_as who seyth, that men han no power to    125
  doon no-thing, ne wilne no-thing_), than folweth it, that oure vyces
  ben referred to the maker of alle good (_as who seyth, than folweth
  it, that god oughte han the blame of oure vyces, sin he constreineth us
  by necessitee to doon vyces_). Thanne is ther no resoun to hopen _in
  god_, ne for to preyen _to god_; for what sholde any wight hopen _to_ 130
  _god_, or why sholde he preyen _to god_, sin that the ordenaunce of
  destinee, which that ne may nat ben inclyned, knitteth and streineth
  alle thinges that men may desiren? Thanne sholde ther be doon
  awey thilke only allyaunce bitwixen god and men, that is to seyn,
  to hopen and to preyen. But by the prys of rightwisnesse and of       135
  verray mekenesse we deserven the gerdoun of the divyne grace,
  which that is inestimable, _that is to seyn, that it is so greet, that it
  ne may nat ben ful y-preysed_. And this is only the manere, _that is
  to seyn, hope and preyeres_, for which it semeth that men mowen
  speke with god, and by resoun of supplicacioun be conioined to        140
  thilke cleernesse, that nis nat aproched no rather or that men
  beseken it and impetren it. And yif men wene nat that hope ne
  preyeres ne han no strengthes, by the necessitee of thinges to
  comen y-received, what thing is ther thanne by whiche we mowen
  ben conioined and clyven to thilke soverein prince of thinges?        145
  For which it bihoveth, by necessitee, that the linage of mankinde,
  as thou songe a litel her-biforn, be departed and unioined from
  his welle, and failen _of his biginninge, that is to seyn, god_.

METRE III.

_Quenam discors federa rerum._

  What discordable cause hath to-rent and unioined the bindinge,
  _or the alliaunce_, of thinges, _that is to seyn, the coniunccioun of god
  and man_? Whiche god hath establisshed so greet bataile bitwixen
  thise two soothfast or verray thinges, _that is to seyn,
  bitwixen the purviaunce of god and free wil_, that they ben singuler    5
  and devyded, ne that they ne wolen nat be medeled ne coupled
  to-gidere? But ther nis no discord to the verray thinges, but they
  clyven, certein, alwey to hem-self. But the thought of man, confounded
  and overthrowen by the dirke membres of the body, ne
  may nat, by fyr of his derked looking, _that is to seyn, by the
      vigour_                                                            10
  _of his insighte, whyl the soule is in the body_, knowe the thinne
  subtil knittinges of thinges. But wherfore enchaufeth it so, by so
  greet love, to finden thilke notes of sooth y-covered; _that is to
  seyn, wherfore enchaufeth the thoght of man by so greet desyr to
  knowen thilke notificacions that ben y-hid under the covertoures of    15
  sooth?_ Wot it aught thilke thing that it, anguissous, desireth to
  knowe? _As who seith, nay; for no man travaileth for to witen
  thinges that he wot. And therfore the texte seith thus_: but who
  travaileth to witen thinges y-knowe? And yif that he ne knoweth
  hem nat, what seketh thilke blinde thoght? What is he that             20
  desireth any thing of which he wot right naught? _As who seith,
  who so desireth any thing, nedes, somwhat he knoweth of it; or
  elles, he ne coude nat desire it._ Or who may folwen thinges that ne
  ben nat y-wist? _And thogh that he seke tho thinges_, wher shal he
  finde hem? What wight, that is al unconninge and ignoraunt,            25
  may knowen the forme that is y-founde? But whan the soule
  biholdeth and seeth the heye thoght, _that is to seyn, god_, than
  knoweth it to-gidere the somme and the singularitees, _that is to
  seyn, the principles and everich by him-self_.

  But now, whyl the soule is hid in the cloude and in the derkenesse     30

PROSE IV.

_Tum illa: Vetus, inquit, hec est._

  Thanne seide she: 'this is,' quod she, 'the olde question of
  the purviaunce of god; and Marcus Tullius, whan he devyded the
  divynaciouns, _that is to seyn, in his book that he wroot of
      divynaciouns_,
  he moevede gretly this questioun; and thou thy-self has y-sought
  it mochel, and outrely, and longe; but yit ne hath it nat ben           5
  determined ne y-sped fermely and diligently of any of yow. And
  the cause of this derkenesse and of this difficultee is, for that the
  moevinge of the resoun of mankinde ne may nat moeven to (_that
  is to seyn, applyen or ioinen to_) the simplicitee of the devyne
  prescience; the whiche _simplicitee of the devyne prescience_, yif     10
  that men mighten thinken it in any maner, _that is to seyn, that yif
  men mighten thinken and comprehenden the thinges as god seeth
  hem_, thanne ne sholde ther dwellen outrely no doute: the whiche
  _resoun and cause of difficultee_ I shal assaye at the laste to shewe
  and to speden, whan I have first y-spended and answered to tho         15
  resouns by which thou art y-moeved. For I axe why thou wenest
  that thilke resouns of hem that assoilen this questioun ne ben
  nat speedful y-nough ne sufficient: the whiche _solucioun, or the
  whiche resoun_, for that it demeth that the prescience nis nat cause
  of necessitee to thinges to comen, than ne weneth it nat that          20
  freedom of wil be destorbed or y-let by prescience. For ne
  drawestow nat arguments from elles-where of the necessitee of
  thinges to-comen (_as who seith, any other wey than thus_) but that
  thilke thinges that the prescience wot biforn ne mowen nat unbityde?
  _That is to seyn, that they moten bityde._ But thanne, yif             25
  that prescience ne putteth no necessitee to thinges to comen, as
  thou thy-self hast confessed it and biknowen a litel her-biforn, what
  cause or what is it (_as who seith, ther may no cause be_) by which
  that the endes voluntarie of thinges mighten be constreined to
  certein bitydinge? For by grace of positioun, so that thou mowe        30
  the betere understonde this that folweth, I pose, _per impossibile_,
  that ther be no prescience. Thanne axe I,' quod she, 'in as
  mochel as apertieneth to that, sholden thanne thinges that comen
  of free wil ben constreined to bityden by necessitee?'

  _Boece._ 'Nay,' quod I.                                                35

  'Thanne ayeinward,' quod she, 'I suppose that ther be prescience,
  but that it ne putteth no necessitee to thinges; thanne
  trowe I, that thilke selve freedom of wil shal dwellen al hool and
  absolut and unbounden. But thou wolt seyn that, al-be-it so that
  prescience nis nat cause of the necessitee of bitydinge to thinges     40
  to comen, algates yit it is a signe that the thinges ben to bityden
  by necessitee. By this manere thanne, al-thogh the prescience
  ne hadde never y-ben, yit _algate or at the leeste weye_ it is certein
  thing, that the endes and bitydinges of thinges to comen sholden
  ben necessarie. For every signe sheweth and signifyeth only what       45
  the thing is, but it ne maketh nat the thing that it signifyeth. For
  which it bihoveth first to shewen, that no-thing ne bitydeth that it
  ne bitydeth by necessitee, so that it may appere that the prescience
  is signe of this necessitee; or elles, yif ther nere no necessitee,
  certes, thilke prescience ne mighte nat be signe of thing that nis     50
  nat. But certes, it is now certein that the proeve of this,
  y-sustened by stidefast resoun, ne shal nat ben lad ne proeved by
  signes ne by arguments y-taken fro with-oute, but by causes
  covenable and necessarie. But _thou mayst seyn_, how may it be
  that the thinges ne bityden nat that ben y-purveyed to comen?          55
  But, certes, right as we trowen that tho thinges which that the
  purviance wot biforn to comen ne ben nat to bityden; but that
  ne sholden we nat demen; but rather, al-thogh that they shal
  bityden, yit ne have they no necessitee of hir kinde to bityden.
  And this maystow lightly aperceiven by this that I shal seyn. For      60
  we seen many thinges whan they ben don biforn oure eyen, right
  as men seen the cartere worken in the torninge or atempringe or
  adressinge of hise cartes or charietes. And by this manere (_as
  who seith, maystow understonde_) of alle othere _workmen_. Is ther
  thanne any necessitee, _as who seith, in oure lokinge_, that
      constreineth                                                       65
  or compelleth any of thilke thinges to ben don so?'

  _Boece._ 'Nay,' quod I; 'for in ydel and in veyn were al the
  effect of craft, yif that alle thinges weren moeved by constreininge;'
  _that is to seyn, by constreininge of oure eyen or of oure sight_.

  _Philosophie._ 'The thinges thanne,' quod she, 'that, whan men         70
  doon hem, ne han no necessitee that men doon hem, eek tho
  same thinges, first or they ben doon, they ben to comen with-oute
  necessitee. For-why ther ben somme thinges to bityden, of which
  the endes and the bitydinges of hem ben absolut and quit of alle
  necessitee. For certes, I ne trowe nat that any man wolde seyn         75
  this: that tho thinges that men doon now, that they ne weren to
  bityden first or they weren y-doon; and thilke same thinges,
  al-thogh that men had y-wist hem biforn, yit they han free
  bitydinges. For right as science of thinges present ne bringeth in
  no necessitee to thinges that men doon, right so the prescience of     80
  thinges to comen ne bringeth in no necessitee to thinges to
  bityden. But thou mayst seyn, that of thilke same it is y-douted,
  as whether that of thilke thinges that ne han non issues and
  bitydinges necessaries, yif ther-of may ben any prescience; for
  certes, they semen to discorden. For thou wenest that, yif that        85
  thinges ben y-seyn biforn, that necessitee folweth hem; and yif
  necessitee faileth hem, they ne mighten nat ben wist biforn, and
  that no-thing ne may ben comprehended by science but certein;
  and yif tho thinges that ne han no certein bitydinges ben purveyed
  as certein, it sholde ben dirknesse of opinioun, nat soothfastnesse    90
  of science. And thou wenest that it be diverse fro the hoolnesse
  of science that any man sholde deme a thing to ben other-weys
  thanne it is it-self. And the cause of this erroure is, that of alle
  the thinges that every wight hath y-knowe, they wenen that tho
  thinges been y-knowe al-oonly by the strengthe and by the nature       95
  of the thinges that ben y-wist or y-knowe; and it is al the
  contrarie. For al that ever is y-knowe, it is rather comprehended
  and knowen, nat after his strengthe and his nature, but after the
  facultee, _that is to seyn, the power and the nature_, of hem that
  knowen. And, for that this thing shal mowen shewen by a short         100
  ensaumple: the same roundnesse of a body, other-weys the sighte
  of the eye knoweth it, and other-weyes the touchinge. The
  lokinge, by castinge of his bemes, waiteth and seeth from afer al
  the body to-gidere, with-oute moevinge of it-self; but the touchinge
  clyveth and conioineth to the rounde body, and moeveth aboute         105
  the environinge, and comprehendeth by parties the roundnesse.
  And the man him-self, other-weys wit biholdeth him, and
  other-weys imaginacioun, and other-weys resoun, and other-weys
  intelligence. For the wit comprehendeth withoute-forth the
  figure of the body of the man that is establissed in the              110
  matere subiect; but the imaginacioun comprehendeth only the
  figure withoute the matere. Resoun surmounteth imaginacioun,
  and comprehendeth by universal lokinge the comune spece that
  is in the singuler peces. But the eye of intelligence is heyere; for
  it surmounteth the environinge of the universitee, and looketh,       115
  over that, by pure subtilitee of thoght, thilke same simple forme
  _of man that is perdurably in the divyne thoght_. In whiche this
  oughte greetly to ben considered, that the heyeste strengthe to
  comprehenden thinges enbraseth and contieneth the lowere
  strengthe; but the lowere strengthe ne aryseth nat in no manere       120
  to heyere strengthe. For wit ne may no-thing comprehende out
  of matere, ne the imaginacioun ne loketh nat the universels
  speces, ne resoun taketh nat the simple forme _so as intelligence
  taketh it_; but intelligence, that looketh al aboven, whan it hath
  comprehended the forme, it knoweth and demeth alle the thinges        125
  that ben under that forme. But _she knoweth hem_ in thilke manere
  in the whiche it comprehendeth thilke same simple forme that
  ne may never ben knowen to none of that other; _that is to seyn,
  to none of tho three forseide thinges of the sowle_. For it knoweth
  the universitee of resoun, and the figure of the imaginacioun,        130
  and the sensible material _conceived by wit_; ne it ne useth nat nor
  of resoun ne of imaginacioun ne of wit withoute-forth; but it
  biholdeth alle thinges, so as I shal seye, by a strok of thought
  formely, _withoute discours or collacioun_. Certes resoun, whan it
  looketh any-thing universel, it ne useth nat of imaginacioun, nor     135
  of witte, and algates yit it comprehendeth the thinges imaginable
  and sensible; for resoun is she that diffinisseth the universel of hir
  conseyte right thus:--man is a resonable two-foted beest. And
  how so that this knowinge is universel, yet nis ther no wight that
  ne woot wel that a man is a thing imaginable and sensible; and        140
  this same considereth wel resoun; but that nis nat by imaginacioun
  nor by wit, but it looketh it by a resonable concepcioun. Also
  imaginacioun, al-be-it so that it taketh of wit the beginninges to
  seen and to formen the figures, algates, al-thogh that wit ne were
  nat present, yit it environeth and comprehendeth alle thinges         145
  sensible; nat by resoun sensible of deminge, but by resoun
  imaginatif. Seestow nat thanne that alle the thinges, in knowinge,
  usen more of hir facultee or of hir power than _they doon of the
  facultee or power_ of thinges that ben y-knowe? Ne that nis nat
  wrong; for so as every Iugement is the dede or doinge of him          150
  that demeth, it bihoveth that every wight performe the werk and
  his entencioun, nat of foreine power, but of his propre power.

  that the sowle hadde ben naked of it-self, as a mirour or a clene

  lyth subgit to tho figures and to tho notes of bodies withoute-forth,
  and yildeth images ydel and veyn in the manere of a mirour,
  whennes thryveth thanne or whennes comth thilke knowinge in
  our sowle, that discerneth and biholdeth alle thinges? And             20
  whennes is thilke strengthe that biholdeth the singuler thinges;
  or whennes is the strengthe that devydeth thinges y-knowe; and
  thilke strengthe that gadereth to-gidere the thinges devyded; and
  the strengthe that cheseth his entrechaunged wey? For som-tyme

PROSE V.

_Quod si in corporibus sentiendis._

  But what yif that in bodies to ben feled, _that is to seyn, in the
  takinge of knowelechinge of bodily thinges_, and al-be-it so that the
  qualitees of bodies, that ben obiecte fro withoute-forth, moeven
  and entalenten the instruments of the wittes; and al-be-it so that
  the passioun of the body, _that is to seyn, the wit or the suffraunce_, 5
  goth to-forn the strengthe of the workinge corage, the which
  passioun or suffraunce clepeth forth the dede of the thoght in him-self,
  and moeveth and exciteth in this mene whyle the formes that
  resten withinne-forth; and yif that, in sensible bodies, as I have
  seyd, our corage nis nat y-taught or empreinted by passioun _to        10
  knowe thise thinges_, but demeth and knoweth, of his owne strengthe,
  the passioun or suffraunce subiect to the body: moche more
  thanne tho thinges that ben absolut and quite fro alle talents
  or affecciouns of bodies, _as god or his aungeles_, ne folwen nat in
  discerninge thinges obiect fro withoute-forth, but they accomplisshen  15
  and speden the dede of hir thoght. By this resoun
  thanne ther comen many maner knowinges to dyverse and
  differinge substaunces. For the wit of the body, the whiche
  wit is naked and despoiled of alle other knowinges, thilke wit
  comth to beestes that ne mowen nat moeven hem-self her and             20
  ther, as _oystres and muscules, and other swiche_ shelle-fish of the
  see, that clyven and ben norisshed to roches. But the imaginacioun
  comth to remuable beestes, that semen to han talent to
  fleen or to desiren any thing. But resoun is al-only to the linage
  of mankinde, right as intelligence is only [to] the devyne nature:     25
  of which it folweth, that thilke knowinge is more worth than thise
  othre, sin it knoweth by his propre nature nat only his subiect, _as
  who seith, it ne knoweth nat al-only that apertieneth properly to his
  knowinge_, but it knoweth the subiects of alle other knowinges.
  But how shal it thanne be, yif that wit and imaginacioun stryven       30
  ayein resoninge, and seyn, that of thilke universel thing that
  resoun weneth to seen, that it nis right naught? _For wit and
  imaginacioun seyn that_ that, that is sensible or imaginable, it ne
  may nat be universel. Thanne is either the Iugement of resoun
  sooth, ne that ther nis nothing sensible; or elles, for that resoun    35
  wot wel that many thinges ben subiect to wit and to imaginacioun,
  thanne is the concepcioun of resoun veyn and false, which that
  loketh and comprehendeth that that is sensible and singuler as
  universel. And yif that resoun wolde answeren ayein to thise
  two, _that is to seyn, to witte and to imaginacioun_, and seyn, that   40
  soothly she hir-self, _that is to seyn, resoun_, loketh and
      comprehendeth,
  by resoun of universalitee, bothe that that is sensible
  and that that is imaginable; and that thilke two, _that is to seyn,
  wit and imaginacioun_, ne mowen nat strecchen ne enhansen hem-self
  to the knowinge of universalitee, for that the knowinge of             45
  hem ne may exceden ne surmounte the bodily figures: certes, of
  the knowinge of thinges, men oughten rather yeven credence to
  the more stedefast and to the more parfit Iugement. In this
  maner stryvinge thanne, we that han strengthe of resoninge and
  of imagininge and of wit, _that is to seyn, by resoun and by
      imaginacioun                                                       50
  and by wit_, we sholde rather preyse the cause of resoun; _as
  who seith, than the cause of wit and of imaginacioun_.

  Semblable thing is it, that the resoun of mankinde ne weneth
  nat that the devyne intelligence bi-holdeth or knoweth thinges to
  comen, but right as the resoun of mankinde knoweth hem. For            55
  thou arguest and seyst thus: that yif it ne seme nat to men that
  some thinges han certein and necessarie bitydinges, they ne
  mowen nat ben wist biforn certeinly to bityden. And thanne
  nis ther no prescience of thilke thinges; and yif we trowe that
  prescience be in thise thinges, thanne is ther no-thing that it ne     60
  bitydeth by necessitee. But certes, yif we mighten han the Iugement
  of the devyne thoght, as we ben parsoneres of resoun, right
  so as we han demed that it behoveth that imaginacioun and wit
  be binethe resoun, right so wolde we demen that it were rightful

_Quam uariis terris animalia permeant figuris._

  The beestes passen by the erthes by ful diverse figures. For
  som of hem han hir bodies straught and crepen in the dust, and
  drawen after hem a tras or a foruh y-continued; _that is to seyn, as
  nadres or snakes_. And other beestes, by the wandringe lightnesse
  of hir winges, beten the windes, and over-swimmen the spaces of         5
  the longe eyr by moist fleeinge. And other beestes gladen hem-self
  to diggen hir tras or hir steppes in the erthe with hir goings
  or with hir feet, and to goon either by the grene feldes, or elles to
  walken under the wodes. And al-be-it so that thou seest that
  they alle discorden by diverse formes, algates hir faces, enclined,    10
  hevieth hir dulle wittes. Only the linage of man heveth heyeste
  his heye heved, and stondeth light with his up-right body, and
  biholdeth the erthes under him. And, but-yif thou, erthely man,
  wexest yvel out of thy wit, this figure amonesteth thee, that axest
  the hevene with thy righte visage, and hast areysed thy fore-heved,    15

PROSE VI.

_Quoniam igitur, uti paullo ante._

  Therfor thanne, as I have shewed a litel her-biforn, that al
  thing that is y-wist nis nat knowen by his nature propre, but by
  the nature of hem that comprehenden it, lat us loke now, in as
  mochel as it is leveful to us, _as who seith, lat us loke now as we
  mowen_, which that the estat is of the devyne substaunce; so that       5
  we mowen eek knowen what his science is. The commune Iugement
  of alle creatures resonables thanne is this: that god is eterne.
  Lat us considere thanne what is eternitee; for certes that shal
  shewen us to-gidere the devyne nature and the devyne science.

  Eternitee, thanne, is parfit possessioun and al-togidere of lyf        10
  interminable; and that sheweth more cleerly by the comparisoun
  or the collacioun of temporel thinges. For al thing that liveth in
  tyme it is present, and procedeth fro preterits in-to futures, _that is
  to seyn, fro tyme passed in-to tyme cominge_; ne ther nis no-thing
  establisshed in tyme that may enbracen to-gider al the space of        15
  his lyf. For certes, yit ne hath it taken the tyme of to-morwe, and
  it hath lost the tyme of yisterday. And certes, in the lyf of this
  day, ye ne liven no more but right as in the moevable and
  transitorie moment. Thanne thilke thing that suffreth temporel
  condicioun, al-thogh that it never bigan to be, ne thogh it never      20
  cese for to be, as Aristotle demed of the world, and al-thogh that
  the lyf of it be strecched with infinitee of tyme, yit algates nis
  it no swich thing that men mighten trowen by right that it is
  eterne. For al-thogh that it comprehende and embrace the space
  of lyf infinit, yit algates ne embraceth it nat the space of the lyf   25
  al-togider; for it ne hath nat the futures that ne ben nat yit, _ne it
  ne hath no lenger the preterits that ben y-doon or y-passed_. But
  thilke thing thanne, that hath and comprehendeth to-gider al the
  plentee of the lyf interminable, to whom ther ne faileth naught of
  the future, and to whom ther nis naught of the preterit escaped        30
  nor y-passed, thilke same is y-witnessed and y-proeved by right to
  be eterne. And it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke thing be
  al-wey present to him-self, and compotent; _as who seith, al-wey
  present to him-self, and so mighty that al be right at his plesaunce_;
  and that he have al present the infinitee of the moevable tyme.        35
  Wher-for som men trowen wrongfully that, whan they heren that
  it semede to Plato that this world ne hadde never beginninge
  of tyme, ne that it never shal han failinge, they wenen in this
  maner that this world be maked coeterne with his maker; _as who
  seith, they wene that this world and god ben maked togider eterne,_    40
  _and that is a wrongful weninge_. For other thing is it to ben y-lad
  by lyf interminable, as Plato graunted to the world, and other
  thing is it to embrace to-gider al the present of the lyf interminable,
  the whiche thing it is cleer and manifest that it is propre to the
  devyne thoght.                                                         45

  Ne it ne sholde nat semen to us, that god is elder thanne
  thinges that ben y-maked by quantitee of tyme, but rather by
  the propretee of his simple nature. For this ilke infinit moevinge
  of temporel thinges folweth this presentarie estat of lyf unmoevable;
  and so as it ne may nat countrefeten it ne feynen it ne be evenlyke    50
  to it for the inmoevabletee, _that is to seyn, that is in the
  eternitee of god_, it faileth and falleth in-to moevinge fro the
      simplicitee
  of the presence _of god_, and disencreseth in-to the infinit
  quantitee of future and of preterit: and so as it ne may nat han
  to-gider al the plentee of the lyf, algates yit, for as moche as it    55
  ne ceseth never for to ben in som maner, it semeth som-del to us,
  that it folweth and resembleth thilke thing that it ne may nat
  atayne to ne fulfillen, and bindeth it-self to som maner presence
  of this litel and swifte moment: the which _presence of this litel
  and swifte moment_, for that it bereth a maner image or lyknesse       60
  of the ay-dwellinge presence _of god_, it graunteth, to swiche maner
  thinges as it bitydeth to, that it semeth hem as thise thinges _han
  y-ben, and_ ben.

  And, for that _the presence of swich litel moment_ ne may nat
  dwelle, ther-for it ravisshed and took the infinit wey of tyme, _that_ 65
  _is to seyn, by successioun_; and by this maner is it y-doon, for that
  it sholde continue the lyf in goinge, of the whiche lyf it ne mighte
  nat enbrace the plentee in dwellinge. And for-thy, yif we wollen
  putten worthy names to thinges, and folwen Plato, lat us seye
  thanne soothly, that god is eterne, and the world is perpetuel.        70
  Thanne, sin that every Iugement knoweth and comprehendeth by
  his owne nature thinges that ben subiect un-to him, ther is soothly
  to god, al-weys, an eterne and presentarie estat; and the science
  of him, that over-passeth al temporel moevement, dwelleth in the
  simplicitee of his presence, and embraceth and considereth alle        75
  the infinit spaces of tymes, preterits and futures, and loketh, in
  his simple knowinge, alle thinges _of preterit_ right as they weren
  y-doon presently right now. Yif thou wolt thanne thenken and
  avyse the prescience, by which it knoweth alle thinges, thou ne
  shal nat demen it as prescience of thinges to comen, but thou          80
  shalt demen it more rightfully that it is science of presence or of
  instaunce, that never ne faileth. For which it nis nat y-cleped
  "previdence," but it sholde rather ben cleped "purviaunce," that
  is establisshed ful fer fro right lowe thinges, and biholdeth from
  a-fer alle thinges, right as it were fro the heye heighte of thinges.  85

  Why axestow thanne, or why desputestow thanne, that thilke
  thinges ben doon by necessitee whiche that ben y-seyn and
  knowen by the devyne sighte, sin that, forsothe, men ne maken
  nat thilke thinges necessarie which that they seen ben y-doon in
  hir sighte? For addeth thy biholdinge any necessitee to thilke         90
  thinges that thou biholdest presente?'

  'Nay,' quod I.

  _Philosophie._ 'Certes, thanne, if men mighte maken any digne
  comparisoun or collacioun of the presence devyne and of the
  presence of mankinde, right so as ye seen some thinges in this         95
  temporel present, right so seeth god alle thinges by his eterne
  present. Wher-fore this devyne prescience ne chaungeth nat the
  nature ne the propretee of thinges, but biholdeth swiche thinges
  present to him-ward as they shullen bityde to yow-ward in tyme
  to comen. Ne it confoundeth nat the Iugement of thinges; but          100
  by o sighte of his thought, he knoweth the thinges to comen, as
  wel necessarie as nat necessarie. Right so as whan ye seen
  to-gider a man walken on the erthe and the sonne arysen in
  the hevene, al-be-it so that ye seen and biholden that oon and
  that other to-gider, yit natheles ye demen and discernen that that    105
  oon is voluntarie and that other necessarie. Right so thanne the
  devyne lookinge, biholdinge alle thinges under him, ne troubleth
  nat the qualitee of thinges that ben certeinly present to him-ward;
  but, as to the condicioun of tyme, forsothe, they ben future. For
  which it folweth, that this nis noon opinioun, but rather a stedefast 110
  knowinge, y-strengthed by soothnesse, that, whanne that god
  knoweth anything to be, he ne unwot nat that thilke thing wanteth
  necessitee to be; _this is to seyn, that, whan that god knoweth any
  thing to bityde, he wot wel that it ne hath no necessitee to bityde._

  And yif thou seyst heer, that thilke thing that god seeth to          115
  bityde, it ne may nat unbityde (_as who seith, it mot bityde_), and
  thilke thing that ne may nat unbityde it mot bityde by necessitee,
  and that thou streyne me by this name of necessitee: certes,
  I wol wel confessen and biknowe a thing of ful sad trouthe, but
  unnethe shal ther any wight mowe _seen it or_ come ther-to, but-yif   120
  that he be biholder of the devyne thoght. For I wol answeren
  thee thus: that thilke thing that is future, whan it is referred
  to the devyne knowinge, thanne is it necessarie; but certes, whan it
  is understonden in his owne kinde, men seen it is outrely free,
  and absolut _fro alle necessitee_.                                    125

  For certes, ther ben two maneres of necessitee. That oon
  necessitee is simple, as thus: that it bihoveth by necessitee, that
  alle men be mortal _or deedly_. Another necessitee is conditionel,
  as thus: yif thou wost that a man walketh, it bihoveth by necessitee
  that he walke. Thilke thing thanne that any wight hath y-knowe        130
  to be, it ne may ben non other weyes thanne he knoweth it to be.
  But this condicioun ne draweth nat with hir thilke necessitee
  simple. For certes, this necessitee _conditionel_, the propre nature
  of it ne maketh it nat, but the adieccioun of the condicioun
  _maketh it_. For no necessitee ne constreyneth a man to gon,          135
  that goth by his propre wil; al-be-it so that, whan he goth,
  that it is necessarie that he goth. Right on this same maner
  thanne, yif that the purviaunce of god seeth any thing present,
  than mot thilke thing ben by necessitee, al-thogh that it ne have
  no necessitee of his owne nature. But certes, the futures that        140
  bityden by freedom of arbitre, god seeth hem alle to-gider present.
  Thise thinges thanne, yif they ben referred to the devyne sighte,
  thanne ben they maked necessarie by the condicioun of the
  devyne knowinge. But certes, yif thilke thinges be considered
  by hem-self, they ben absolut _of necessitee_, and ne forleten nat ne 145
  cesen nat of the libertee of hir owne nature. Thanne, certes,
  with-oute doute, alle the thinges shollen ben doon which that
  god wot biforn that they ben to comen. But som of hem comen
  and bityden of free arbitre _or of free wille_, that, al-be-it so that
  they bityden, yit algates ne lese they nat hir propre nature in       150
  beinge; by the which first, or that they weren y-doon, they
  hadden power nat to han bitid.'

  _Boece_. 'What is this to seyn thanne,' quod I, 'that thinges ne
  ben nat necessarie _by hir propre nature_, so as they comen in alle
  maneres in the lyknesse of necessitee by the condicioun of the        155
  devyne science?'

  _Philosophie._ 'This is the difference,' quod she; 'that tho
  thinges that I purposede thee a litel heer-biforn, that is to seyn,
  the sonne arysinge and the man walkinge, that, ther-whyles that
  thilke thinges been y-doon, they ne mighte nat ben undoon;            160
  natheles, that oon of hem, or it was y-doon, it bihoved by necessitee
  that it was y-doon, but nat that other. Right so _is it
  here_, that the thinges that god hath present, with-oute doute they
  shollen been. But som of hem descendeth of the nature of
  thinges, _as the sonne arysinge_; and som descendeth of the power     165
  of the doeres, _as the man walkinge_. Thanne seide I no wrong,
  that yif these thinges ben referred to the devyne knowinge, thanne
  ben they necessarie; and yif they ben considered by hem-self,
  thanne ben they absolut fro the bond of necessitee. Right so as
  alle thinges that apereth or sheweth to the wittes, yif thou referre  170
  it to resoun, it is universel; and yif thou referre it or loke it
  to it-self, than is it singuler. But now, yif thou seyst thus, that
  yif it be in my power to chaunge my purpos, than shal I voide the
  purviaunce _of god_, whan that, peraventure, I shal han chaunged
  the thinges that he knoweth biforn, thanne shal I answere thee        175
  thus. Certes, thou mayst wel chaunge thy purpos; but, for as
  mochel as the present soothnesse of the devyne purviaunce biholdeth
  that thou mayst chaunge thy purpos, and whether thou
  wolt chaunge it or no, and whiderward that thou torne it, thou ne
  mayst nat eschuen the devyne prescience; right as thou ne mayst       180
  nat fleen the sighte of the presente eye, al-though that thou torne
  thy-self by thy free wil in-to dyverse acciouns. But thou mayst
  seyn ayein: "How shal it thanne be? Shal nat the devyne
  science be chaunged by my disposicioun, whan that I wol o thing
  now, and now another? And thilke prescience, ne semeth it nat         185
  to entrechaunge stoundes of knowinge;"' _as who seith, ne shal it
  nat seme to us, that the devyne prescience entrechaungeth hise dyverse
  stoundes of knowinge, so that it knowe sum-tyme o thing and sum-tyme
  the contrarie of that thing?_

  'No, forsothe,' _quod I_.                                             190

  _Philosophie._ 'For the devyne sighte renneth to-forn and seeth alle
  futures, and clepeth hem ayein, and retorneth hem to the presence
  of his propre knowinge; ne he ne entrechaungeth nat, so as thou
  wenest, the stoundes of forknowinge, as now this, now that; but
  he ay-dwellinge comth biforn, and embraceth at o strook alle thy      195
  mutaciouns. And this presence to comprehenden and to seen
  alle thinges, god ne hath nat taken it of the bitydinge of thinges
  to come, but of his propre simplicitee. And her-by is assoiled
  thilke thing that thou puttest a litel her-biforn, _that is to seyn_,
  that it is unworthy thing to seyn, that our futures yeven cause of    200
  the science of god. For certes, this strengthe of the devyne
  science, which that embraceth alle thinges by his presentarie
  knowinge, establissheth maner to alle thinges, and it ne oweth
  naught to latter thinges; and sin that these thinges ben thus,
  _that is to seyn, sin that necessitee nis nat in thinges by the
      devyne_                                                           205
  _prescience_, than is ther freedom of arbitre, that dwelleth hool and
  unwemmed to mortal men. Ne the lawes ne purposen nat
  wikkedly medes and peynes to the willinges of men that ben
  unbounden and quite of alle necessitee. And god, biholder and
  for-witer of alle thinges, dwelleth above; and the present eternitee  210
  of his sighte renneth alwey with the dyverse qualitee of oure
  dedes, despensinge and ordeyninge medes to goode men, and
  torments to wikked men. Ne in ydel ne in veyn ne ben ther nat
  put in god hope and preyeres, that ne mowen nat ben unspeedful
  ne with-oute effect, whan they ben rightful.                          215

  Withstond thanne and eschue thou vyces; worshipe and love
  thou virtues; areys thy corage to rightful hopes; yilde thou
  humble preyeres a-heigh. Gret necessitee of prowesse and vertu
  is encharged and commaunded to yow, yif ye nil nat dissimulen;

TROILUS AND CRISEYDE.

BOOK I.


  1. The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,
  That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
  In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
  Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,
  My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.                                   5
  Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte
  Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte!

  2. To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,
  Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;
  Help me, that am the sorwful instrument                                10
  That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne!
  For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,
  A woful wight to han a drery fere,
  And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.

  3. For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,                           15
  Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,
  Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,
  So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;
  But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse
  To any lover, and his cause avayle,                                    20
  Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle!

  4. But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,
  If any drope of pitee in yow be,
  Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse
  That ye han felt, and on the adversitee                                25
  Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
  Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;
  Or ye han wonne him with to greet an ese.

  5. And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas
  Of Troilus, as ye may after here,                                      30
  That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,
  And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,
  That I have might to shewe, in som manere,
  Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,
  In Troilus unsely aventure.                                            35

  6. And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred
  In love, that never nil recovered be,
  And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred
  Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;
  Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,                                  40
  To graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,
  That been despeyred out of Loves grace.

  7. And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
  That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,
  And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,                            45
  That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.
  For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
  To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,
  And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee.

  8. And for to have of hem compassioun                                  50
  As though I were hir owene brother dere.
  Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,
  For now wol I gon streight to my matere,
  In whiche ye may the double sorwes here
  Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,                                     55
  And how that she forsook him er she deyde.

  9. It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge
  In armes with a thousand shippes wente
  To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
  Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,                               60
  And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,
  The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,
  By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne.

  10. Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was
  Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,                                  65
  A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,
  That in science so expert was, that he
  Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,
  By answere of his god, that highte thus,
  Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.                                       70

  11. So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,
  And eek by answere of this Appollo,
  That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,
  Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,
  He caste anoon out of the toun to go;                                  75
  For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde
  Destroyed been, ye, wolde who-so nolde.

  12. For which, for to departen softely
  Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,
  And to the Grekes ost ful prively                                      80
  He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,
  Him deden bothe worship and servyse,
  In trust that he hath conning hem to rede
  In every peril which that is to drede.

  13. The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,                       85
  Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,
  That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed
  With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken
  On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
  And seyden, he and al his kin at ones                                  90
  Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.

  14. Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,
  Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,
  His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,
  For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,                              95
  As she that niste what was best to rede;
  For bothe a widowe was she, and allone
  Of any freend, to whom she dorste hir mone.

  15. Criseyde was this lady name a-right;
  As to my dome, in al Troyes citee                                     100
  Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight
  So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,
  That lyk a thing inmortal semed she,
  As doth an hevenish parfit creature,
  That doun were sent in scorning of nature.                            105

  16. This lady, which that al-day herde at ere
  Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,
  Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
  In widewes habit large of samit broun,
  On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;                                 110
  With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,
  His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge.

  17. Now was this Ector pitous of nature,
  And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,
  And that she was so fair a creature;                                  115
  Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,
  And seyde, 'lat your fadres treson goon
  Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye,
  Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye.

  18. And al thonour that men may doon yow have,                        120
  As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,
  Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,
  As fer as I may ought enquere or here.'
  And she him thonked with ful humble chere,
  And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,                          125
  And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille.

  19. And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee
  As to hir honour nede was to holde;
  And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,
  Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde                          130
  Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.
  But whether that she children hadde or noon,
  I rede it nought; therfore I lete it goon.

  20. The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,
  Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;                                135
  For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,
  And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe
  The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte,
  And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe
  After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe.                            140

  21. But how this toun com to destruccioun
  Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;
  For it were here a long disgressioun
  Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle.
  But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,                                145
  In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,
  Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.

  22. But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,
  And hir citee bisegede al a-boute,
  Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,                                 150
  As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;
  But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
  They hadde a relik hight Palladion,
  That was hir trist a-boven everichon.

  23. And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme                             155
  Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede
  With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme,
  And swote smellen floures whyte and rede,
  In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede,
  The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,                              160
  Palladiones feste for to holde.

  24. And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse,
  In general, ther wente many a wight,
  To herknen of Palladion the servyse;
  And namely, so many a lusty knight,                                   165
  So many a lady fresh and mayden bright,
  Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,
  Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.

  25. Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
  In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,                                170
  Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
  In beautee first so stood she, makelees;
  Hir godly looking gladede al the prees.
  Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre,
  Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre                              175

  26. As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon
  That hir bihelden in hir blake wede;
  And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,
  Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,
  And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,                            180
  Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere,
  With ful assured loking and manere.

  27. This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde
  His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun
  In thilke large temple on every syde,                                 185
  Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun,
  Now here, now there, for no devocioun
  Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,
  But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste.

  28. And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten                         190
  If knight or squyer of his companye
  Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten
  On any woman that he coude aspye;
  He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,
  And seye him thus, 'god wot, she slepeth softe                        195
  For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!

  29. 'I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,
  Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,
  And which a labour folk han in winninge
  Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;                        200
  And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces;
  O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye;
  Ther nis not oon can war by other be.'

  30. And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
  Ascaunces, 'lo! is this nought wysly spoken?'                         205
  At which the god of love gan loken rowe
  Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken;
  He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;
  For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle;
  And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.                                210

  31. O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!
  How ofte falleth al theffect contraire
  Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun;
  For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.
  This Troilus is clomben on the staire,                                215
  And litel weneth that he moot descenden.
  But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden.

  32. As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe
  Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,
  Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,                               220
  Than thenketh he, 'though I praunce al biforn
  First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,
  Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe
  I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.'

  33. So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;                       225
  Though he a worthy kinges sone were,
  And wende no-thing hadde had swiche might
  Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,
  Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,
  That he, that now was most in pryde above,                            230
  Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love.

  34. For-thy ensample taketh of this man,
  Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle,
  To scornen Love, which that so sone can
  The freedom of your hertes to him thralle;                            235
  For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
  That Love is he that alle thing may binde;
  For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde.

  35. That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;
  For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,                             240
  Men reden not that folk han gretter wit
  Than they that han be most with love y-nome;
  And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
  The worthiest and grettest of degree;
  This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.                            245

  36. And trewelich it sit wel to be so;
  For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed;
  And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
  With love han ben conforted most and esed;
  And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,                              250
  And worthy folk maad worthier of name,
  And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame.

  37. Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,
  And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,
  Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,                                 255
  Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde.
  The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde
  Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede
  To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.

  38. But for to tellen forth in special                                260
  As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,
  And leten other thing collateral,
  Of him thenke I my tale for to holde,
  Bothe of his Ioye, and of his cares colde;
  And al his werk, as touching this matere,                             265
  For I it gan, I wil ther-to refere.

  39. With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,
  This Troilus, of every wight aboute,
  On this lady and now on that lokinge,
  Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute:                           270
  And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route
  His eye perced, and so depe it wente,
  Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente.

  40. And sodeynly he wex ther-with astoned,
  And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse:                             275
  'O mercy, god!' thoughte he, 'wher hastow woned,
  That art so fair and goodly to devyse?'
  Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse,
  And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,
  And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere.                         280

  41. She nas not with the leste of hir stature,
  But alle hir limes so wel answeringe
  Weren to womanhode, that creature
  Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.
  And eek the pure wyse of here meninge                                 285
  Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse
  Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.

  42. To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle
  Gan for to lyke hir mening and hir chere,
  Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle                          290
  Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere,
  Ascaunces, 'what! may I not stonden here?'
  And after that hir loking gan she lighte,
  That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.

  43. And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken                         295
  So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,
  That in his hertes botme gan to stiken
  Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:
  And though he erst hadde poured up and doun,
  He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;                             300
  Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke.

  44. Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge,
  And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen,
  Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
  With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yën;                             305
  That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen,
  Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;
  Blessed be love, that thus can folk converte!

  45. She, this in blak, lykinge to Troylus,
  Over alle thyng he stood for to biholde;                              310
  Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,
  He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;
  But from a-fer, his maner for to holde,
  On other thing his look som-tyme he caste,
  And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste.                              315

  46. And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,
  Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,
  Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped
  Of loves folk, lest fully the descente
  Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente,                       320
  Lest it were wist on any maner syde,
  His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde.

  47. Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
  He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth,
  Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted,                  325
  Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth;
  And al his chere and speche also he borneth;
  And ay, of loves servants every whyle,
  Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle.

  48. And seyde, 'lord, so ye live al in lest,                          330
  Ye loveres! for the conningest of yow,
  That serveth most ententiflich and best,
  Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow;
  Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how!
  Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse;                       335
  In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse!

  49. In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces,
  But it a sely fewe poyntes be;
  Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces
  As doth your lay, and that knowe alle ye;                             340
  But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;
  But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve,
  Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve!

  50. But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,
  Or elles doon of good entencioun,                                     345
  Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue,
  And deme it harm in hir opinioun;
  And yet if she, for other enchesoun,
  Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon:
  Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!'                             350

  51. But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,
  He held his pees, non other bote him gayned;
  For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme,
  That wel unnethe un-to his folk he feyned
  That othere besye nedes him destrayned;                               355
  For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,
  But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.

  52. And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
  He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette,
  And first he gan to syke, and eft to grone,                           360
  And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette,
  That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette
  That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse
  Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse.

  53. Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,                           365
  In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;
  And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
  It was to him a right good aventure
  To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure
  To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,                          370
  Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace.

  54. Imagininge that travaille nor grame
  Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn
  As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
  Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born                              375
  Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
  Thus argumented he in his ginninge,
  Ful unavysed of his wo cominge.

  55. Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,
  And thoughte he wolde werken prively,                                 380
  First, to hyden his desir in muwe
  From every wight y-born, al-outrely,
  But he mighte ought recovered be therby;
  Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe
  Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe.                         385

  56. And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
  What for to speke, and what to holden inne,
  And what to arten hir to love he soughte,
  And on a song anoon-right to biginne,
  And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;                              390
  For with good hope he gan fully assente
  Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.

  57. And of his song nought only the sentence,
  As writ myn autour called Lollius,
  But pleynly, save our tonges difference,                              395
  I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus
  Seyde in his song; lo! every word right thus
  As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here,
  Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.

                      CANTUS TROILI.

  58. 'If no love is, O god, what fele I so?                            400
  And if love is, what thing and whiche is he!
  If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?
  If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,
  Whenne every torment and adversitee
  That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;                          405
  For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.

  59. And if that at myn owene lust I brenne,
  Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte?
  If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne?
  I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte.                                  410
  O quike deeth, o swete harm so queynte,
  How may of thee in me swich quantitee,
  But-if that I consente that it be?

  60. And if that I consente, I wrongfully
  Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro,                             415
  Al sterelees with-inne a boot am I
  A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two,
  That in contrarie stonden ever-mo.
  Allas! what is this wonder maladye?
  For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.'                          420

  61. And to the god of love thus seyde he
  With pitous voys, 'O lord, now youres is
  My spirit, which that oughte youres be.
  Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this;
  But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis,                                425
  She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;
  But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve.

  62. Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,
  As in a place un-to your vertu digne;
  Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I                                    430
  May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne;
  For myn estat royal here I resigne
  In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere
  Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.'

  63. In him ne deyned sparen blood royal                               435
  The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse,
  Ne him forbar in no degree, for al
  His vertu or his excellent prowesse;
  But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,
  And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe,                             440
  That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe.

  64. So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
  For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,
  That every other charge he sette at nought;
  For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese,                               445
  To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;
  For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende,
  And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.

  65. For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is,
  This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye.                              450
  But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
  By night or day, for wysdom or folye,
  His herte, which that is his brestes yë,
  Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene
  Than ever was Eleyne or Polixene.                                     455

  66. Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
  That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde,
  'Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
  As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde,
  Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde!                                 460
  My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe
  And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.'

  67. Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
  Bothe of the assege and his savacioun;
  Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde                             465
  But arguments to this conclusioun,
  That she on him wolde han compassioun,
  And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure;
  Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure!

  68. The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,                          470
  That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,
  Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve;
  And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden,
  Founde oon the best, and lengest tyme abiden
  Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle                            475
  In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle.

  69. But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
  Ne also for the rescous of the toun,
  Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,
  But only, lo, for this conclusioun,                                   480
  To lyken hir the bet for his renoun;
  Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,
  That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde.

  70. And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep,
  And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe                          485
  Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep,
  It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;
  Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe
  Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende
  That the hote fyr of love him brende.                                 490

  71. And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;
  But how it was, certayn, can I not seye,
  If that his lady understood not this,
  Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;
  But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,                                495
  Ne semed it [as] that she of him roughte,
  Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte.

  72. But than fel to this Troylus such wo,
  That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede
  Was this, that she som wight had loved so,                            500
  That never of him she wolde have taken hede;
  For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede.
  Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne
  To tellen it, for al this world to winne.

  73. But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,                         505
  Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne;
  He sayde, 'O fool, now art thou in the snare,
  That whilom Iapedest at loves peyne;
  Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne;
  Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende                              510
  Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.

  74. What wole now every lover seyn of thee,
  If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence
  Laughen in scorn, and seyn, "lo, ther gooth he,
  That is the man of so gret sapience,                                  515
  That held us loveres leest in reverence!
  Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce
  Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce!

  75. But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde,
  Sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee,                              520
  That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde
  Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:
  But al so cold in love, towardes thee,
  Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,
  And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone."                            525

  76. God wolde I were aryved in the port
  Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!
  A, lord, to me it were a greet comfort;
  Then were I quit of languisshing in drede.
  For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede                               530
  I shal bi-Iaped been a thousand tyme
  More than that fool of whos folye men ryme.

  77. But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom
  I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste!
  O mercy, dere herte, and help me from                                 535
  The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste,
  More than my-self wol love yow to my laste.
  And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,
  Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!'

  78. This wordes and ful manye an-other to                             540
  He spak, and called ever in his compleynte
  Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,
  Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte.
  Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;
  And whan that he bithoughte on that folye,                            545
  A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye.

  79. Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone,
  A freend of his, that called was Pandare,
  Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,
  And sey his freend in swich distresse and care:                       550
  'Allas!' quod he, 'who causeth al this fare?
  O mercy, god! what unhap may this mene?
  Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?

  80. Or hastow som remors of conscience,
  And art now falle in som devocioun,                                   555
  And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,
  And hast for ferde caught attricioun?
  God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,
  And so can leye our Iolyte on presse,
  And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!'                               560

  81. These wordes seyde he for the nones alle,
  That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken,
  And with an angre don his sorwe falle,
  As for the tyme, and his corage awaken;
  But wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken,                            565
  Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse
  Than he, ne more desired worthinesse.

  82. 'What cas,' quod Troilus, 'or what aventure
  Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge,
  That am refus of euery creature?                                      570
  But for the love of god, at my preyinge,
  Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge
  Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye;
  Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye.

  83. But if thou wene I be thus syk for drede,                         575
  It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought;
  Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede
  Wel more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought,
  Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought.
  But though that I now telle thee it ne leste,                         580
  Be thou nought wrooth, I hyde it for the beste.'

  84. This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,
  Ful often seyde, 'allas! what may this be?
  Now freend,' quod he, 'if ever love or trouthe
  Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me,                              585
  Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee
  To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care;
  Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare?

  85. I wole parten with thee al thy peyne,
  If it be so I do thee no comfort,                                     590
  As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,
  To entreparten wo, as glad desport.
  I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,
  In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve;
  Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.'                           595

  86. Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,
  And seyde him thus, 'god leve it be my beste
  To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee lyke,
  Yet wole I telle it, though myn herte breste;
  And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste.                              600
  But lest thow deme I truste not to thee,
  Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me.

  87. Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth
  Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth,
  With desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,                             605
  That streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth.
  Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth,
  That to ben slayn it were a gretter Ioye
  To me than king of Grece been and Troye!

  88. Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,                          610
  That I have seyd, for now wostow my wo;
  And for the love of god, my colde care
  So hyd it wel, I telle it never to mo;
  For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two,
  If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,                            615
  And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.'

  89. 'How hastow thus unkindely and longe
  Hid this fro me, thou fool?' quod Pandarus;
  'Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe,
  That myn avys anoon may helpen us.'                                   620
  'This were a wonder thing,' quod Troylus,
  'Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;
  How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?'

  90. 'Ye, Troilus, now herke,' quod Pandare,
  'Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,                                625
  That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare,
  By good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro.
  I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go
  Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde;
  A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde.                                   630

  91. A whetston is no kerving instrument,
  And yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis.
  And ther thow woost that I have ought miswent,
  Eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is;
  Thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis.                                  635
  If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared;
  By his contrarie is every thing declared.

  92. For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe
  To him that never tasted bitternesse?
  Ne no man may be inly glad, I trowe,                                  640
  That never was in sorwe or som distresse;
  Eek whyt by blak, by shame eek worthinesse,
  Ech set by other, more for other semeth;
  As men may see; and so the wyse it demeth.

  93. Sith thus of two contraries is a lore,                            645
  I, that have in love so ofte assayed
  Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more
  Counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed.
  Eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed,
  Though I desyre with thee for to bere                                 650
  Thyn hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere.

  94. I woot wel that it fareth thus by me
  As to thy brother Parys an herdesse,
  Which that y-cleped was Oënone,
  Wrot in a compleynt of hir hevinesse:                                 655
  Ye say the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?'
  Nay, never yet, y-wis,' quod Troilus.
  'Now,' quod Pandare, 'herkneth; it was thus.--

  95. "Phebus, that first fond art of medicyne,"
  Quod she, "and coude in every wightes care                            660
  Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fyne,
  Yet to him-self his conninge was ful bare;
  For love hadde him so bounden in a snare,
  Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete,
  That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete."--                         665

  96. Right so fare I, unhappily for me;
  I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore;
  And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee,
  And not my-self; repreve me no more.
  I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore                              670
  As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleye,
  But to thyn help yet somwhat can I seye.

  97. And of o thing right siker maystow be,
  That certayn, for to deyen in the peyne,
  That I shal never-mo discoveren thee;                                 675
  Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreyne
  Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleyne,
  That is thy brotheres wyf, if ich it wiste;
  Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste.

  98. Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure,                         680
  And tel me plat what is thyn enchesoun,
  And final cause of wo that ye endure;
  For douteth no-thing, myn entencioun
  Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun,
  To speke as now, for no wight may bireve                              685
  A man to love, til that him list to leve.

  99. And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vyces,
  Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve;
  But wel I woot, the mene of it no vyce is,
  For for to trusten sum wight is a preve                               690
  Of trouthe, and for-thy wolde I fayn remeve
  Thy wrong conceyte, and do thee som wight triste,
  Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste.

  100. The wyse seyth, "wo him that is allone,
  For, and he falle, he hath noon help to ryse;"                        695
  And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone;
  For this nis not, certeyn, the nexte wyse
  To winnen love, as techen us the wyse,
  To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,
  Whos teres yet in marbel been y-sene.                                 700

  101. Lat be thy weping and thy drerinesse,
  And lat us lissen wo with other speche;
  So may thy woful tyme seme lesse.
  Delyte not in wo thy wo to seche,
  As doon thise foles that hir sorwes eche                              705
  With sorwe, whan they han misaventure,
  And listen nought to seche hem other cure.

  102. Men seyn, "to wrecche is consolacioun
  To have an-other felawe in his peyne;"
  That oughte wel ben our opinioun,                                     710
  For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleyne;
  So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne,
  That certeynly no more harde grace
  May sitte on me, for-why ther is no space.

  103. If god wole thou art not agast of me,                            715
  Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigyle,
  Thow wost thy-self whom that I love, pardee,
  As I best can, gon sithen longe whyle.
  And sith thou wost I do it for no wyle,
  And sith I am he that thou tristest most,                             720
  Tel me sumwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.'

  104. Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde,
  But longe he lay as stille as he ded were;
  And after this with sykinge he abreyde,
  And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere,                                725
  And up his eyen caste he, that in fere
  Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesye
  He sholde falle, or elles sone dye:

  105. And cryde 'a-wake' ful wonderly and sharpe;
  'What? slombrestow as in a lytargye?                                  730
  Or artow lyk an asse to the harpe,
  That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plye,
  But in his minde of that no melodye
  May sinken, him to glade, for that he
  So dul is of his bestialitee?'                                        735

  106. And with that Pandare of his wordes stente;
  But Troilus yet him no word answerde,
  For-why to telle nas not his entente
  To never no man, for whom that he so ferde.
  For it is seyd, 'man maketh ofte a yerde                              740
  With which the maker is him-self y-beten
  In sondry maner,' as thise wyse treten,

  107. And namely, in his counseyl tellinge
  That toucheth love that oughte be secree;
  For of him-self it wolde y-nough out-springe,                         745
  But-if that it the bet governed be.
  Eek som-tyme it is craft to seme flee
  Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;
  Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste.

  108. But nathelees, whan he had herd him crye                         750
  'Awake!' he gan to syke wonder sore,
  And seyde, 'freend, though that I stille lye,
  I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;
  For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore;
  But suffre me my mischef to biwayle,                                  755
  For thy proverbes may me nought avayle.

  109. Nor other cure canstow noon for me.
  Eek I nil not be cured, I wol deye;
  What knowe I of the quene Niobe?
  Lat be thyne olde ensaumples, I thee preye.'                          760
  'No,' quod tho Pandarus, 'therfore I seye,
  Swich is delyt of foles to biwepe
  Hir wo, but seken bote they ne kepe.

  110. Now knowe I that ther reson in thee fayleth.
  But tel me, if I wiste what she were                                  765
  For whom that thee al this misaunter ayleth?
  Dorstestow that I tolde hir in hir ere
  Thy wo, sith thou darst not thy-self for fere,
  And hir bisoughte on thee to han som routhe?'
  'Why, nay,' quod he, 'by god and by my trouthe!'                      770

  111. 'What? not as bisily,' quod Pandarus,
  'As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede?'
  'No, certes, brother,' quod this Troilus.
  'And why?'--'For that thou sholdest never spede.'
  'Wostow that wel?'--'Ye, that is out of drede,'                       775
  Quod Troilus, 'for al that ever ye conne,
  She nil to noon swich wrecche as I be wonne.'

  112. Quod Pandarus, 'allas! what may this be,
  That thou despeyred art thus causelees?
  What? liveth not thy lady? _benedicite!_                              780
  How wostow so that thou art gracelees?
  Swich yvel is not alwey botelees.
  Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,
  Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure.

  113. I graunte wel that thou endurest wo                              785
  As sharp as doth he, Ticius, in helle,
  Whos stomak foules tyren ever-mo
  That highte volturis, as bokes telle.
  But I may not endure that thou dwelle
  In so unskilful an opinioun                                           790
  That of thy wo is no curacioun.

  114. But ones niltow, for thy coward herte,
  And for thyn ire and folish wilfulnesse,
  For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte,
  Ne to thyn owene help do bisinesse                                    795
  As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse,
  But lyest as he that list of no-thing recche.
  What womman coude love swich a wrecche?

  115. What may she demen other of thy deeth,
  If thou thus deye, and she not why it is,                             800
  But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,
  For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis?
  Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this!
  Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones,
  "The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!"                      805

  116. Thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele;
  But, love a woman that she woot it nought,
  And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele;
  Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought.
  What! many a man hath love ful dere y-bought                          810
  Twenty winter that his lady wiste,
  That never yet his lady mouth he kiste.

  117. What? shulde he therfor fallen in despeyr,
  Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,
  Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr?                               815
  Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene
  To serve and love his dere hertes quene,
  And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve
  A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.'

  118. And of that word took hede Troilus,                              820
  And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,
  And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,
  That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne,
  But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,
  And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;                             825
  For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte.

  119. And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,
  And seyde, 'allas! what is me best to do?'
  To whom Pandare answerde, 'if thee lyke,
  The best is that thou telle me thy wo;                                830
  And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,
  I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,
  To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!'

  120. 'Ye, so thou seyst,' quod Troilus tho, 'allas!
  But, god wot, it is not the rather so;                                835
  Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,
  For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,
  Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go
  May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;
  For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.'                   840

  121. Quod Pandarus, 'than blamestow Fortune
  For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;
  Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune
  To every maner wight in som degree?
  And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!                           845
  That, as hir Ioyes moten over-goon,
  So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon.

  122. For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,
  Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:
  Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may soiorne,                            850
  What wostow if hir mutabilitee
  Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee,
  Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge?
  Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe!

  123. And therfor wostow what I thee beseche?                          855
  Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde;
  For who-so list have helping of his leche,
  To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde.
  To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde,
  Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe,                                  860
  By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe.

  124. Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is
  Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede;
  Knowe ich hir ought? for my love, tel me this;
  Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.'                              865
  Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,
  For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;
  'A ha!' quod Pandare, 'here biginneth game!'

  125. And with that word he gan him for to shake,
  And seyde, 'theef, thou shalt hir name telle.'                        870
  But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
  As though men sholde han lad him in-to helle,
  And seyde, 'allas! of al my wo the welle,
  Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!'
  And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde.                         875

  126. And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,
  Lord, he was glad, and seyde, 'freend so dere,
  Now fare a-right, for Ioves name in hevene,
  Love hath biset the wel, be of good chere;
  For of good name and wysdom and manere                                880
  She hath y-nough, and eek of gentilesse;
  If she be fayr, thow wost thy-self, I gesse.

  127. Ne I never saw a more bountevous
  Of hir estat, ne a gladder, ne of speche
  A freendlier, ne a more gracious                                      885
  For to do wel, ne lasse hadde nede to seche
  What for to doon; and al this bet to eche,
  In honour, to as fer as she may strecche,
  A kinges herte semeth by hires a wrecche.

  128. And for-thy loke of good comfort thou be;                        890
  For certeinly, the firste poynt is this
  Of noble corage and wel ordeynè,
  A man to have pees with him-self, y-wis;
  So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is
  To loven wel, and in a worthy place;                                  895
  Thee oughte not to clepe it hap, but grace.

  129. And also thenk, and ther-with glade thee,
  That sith thy lady vertuous is al,
  So folweth it that ther is som pitee
  Amonges alle thise othere in general;                                 900
  And for-thy see that thou, in special,
  Requere nought that is ayein hir name;
  For vertue streccheth not him-self to shame.

  130. But wel is me that ever I was born,
  That thou biset art in so good a place;                               905
  For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn,
  Thee sholde never han tid thus fayr a grace;
  And wostow why? for thou were wont to chace
  At love in scorn, and for despyt him calle
  "Seynt Idiot, lord of thise foles alle."                              910

  131. How often hastow maad thy nyce Iapes,
  And seyd, that loves servants everichone
  Of nycetee ben verray goddes apes;
  And some wolde monche hir mete alone,
  Ligging a-bedde, and make hem for to grone;                           915
  And som, thou seydest, hadde a blaunche fevere,
  And preydest god he sholde never kevere!

  132. And some of hem toke on hem, for the colde,
  More than y-nough, so seydestow ful ofte;
  And some han feyned ofte tyme, and tolde                              920
  How that they wake, whan they slepen softe;
  And thus they wolde han brought hem-self a-lofte,
  And nathelees were under at the laste;
  Thus seydestow, and Iapedest ful faste.

  133. Yet seydestow, that, for the more part,                          925
  These loveres wolden speke in general,
  And thoughten that it was a siker art,
  For fayling, for to assayen over-al.
  Now may I iape of thee, if that I shal!
  But nathelees, though that I sholde deye,                             930
  That thou art noon of tho, that dorste I seye.

  134. Now beet thy brest, and sey to god of love,
  "Thy grace, lord! for now I me repente
  If I mis spak, for now my-self I love:"
  Thus sey with al thyn herte in good entente.'                         935
  Quod Troilus, 'a! lord! I me consente,
  And pray to thee my Iapes thou foryive,
  And I shal never-more whyl I live.'

  135. 'Thow seyst wel,' quod Pandare, 'and now I hope
  That thou the goddes wraththe hast al apesed;                         940
  And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope,
  And seyd swich thing wher-with thy god is plesed,
  Now wolde never god but thou were esed;
  And think wel, she of whom rist al thy wo
  Here-after may thy comfort been al-so.                                945

  136. For thilke ground, that bereth the wedes wikke,
  Bereth eek thise holsom herbes, as ful ofte
  Next the foule netle, rough and thikke,
  The rose waxeth swote and smothe and softe;
  And next the valey is the hil a-lofte;                                950
  And next the derke night the glade morwe;
  And also Ioye is next the fyn of sorwe.

  137. Now loke that atempre be thy brydel,
  And, for the beste, ay suffre to the tyde,
  Or elles al our labour is on ydel;                                    955
  He hasteth wel that wysly can abyde;
  Be diligent, and trewe, and ay wel hyde.
  Be lusty, free, persevere in thy servyse,
  And al is wel, if thou werke in this wyse.

  138. But he that parted is in every place                             960
  Is no-wher hool, as writen clerkes wyse;
  What wonder is, though swich oon have no grace?
  Eek wostow how it fareth of som servyse?
  As plaunte a tre or herbe, in sondry wyse,
  And on the morwe pulle it up as blyve,                                965
  No wonder is, though it may never thryve.

  139. And sith that god of love hath thee bistowed
  In place digne un-to thy worthinesse,
  Stond faste, for to good port hastow rowed;
  And of thy-self, for any hevinesse,                                   970
  Hope alwey wel; for, but-if drerinesse
  Or over-haste our bothe labour shende,
  I hope of this to maken a good ende.

  140. And wostow why I am the lasse a-fered
  Of this matere with my nece trete?                                    975
  For this have I herd seyd of wyse y-lered,
  "Was never man ne woman yet bigete
  That was unapt to suffren loves hete
  Celestial, or elles love of kinde;"
  For-thy som grace I hope in hir to finde.                             980

  141. And for to speke of hir in special,
  Hir beautee to bithinken and hir youthe,
  It sit hir nought to be celestial
  As yet, though that hir liste bothe and couthe;
  But trewely, it sete hir wel right nouthe                             985
  A worthy knight to loven and cheryce,
  And but she do, I holde it for a vyce.

  142. Wherfore I am, and wol be, ay redy
  To peyne me to do yow this servyse;
  For bothe yow to plese thus hope I                                    990
  Her-afterward; for ye beth bothe wyse,
  And conne it counseyl kepe in swich a wyse,
  That no man shal the wyser of it be;
  And so we may be gladed alle three.

  143. And, by my trouthe, I have right now of thee                     995
  A good conceyt in my wit, as I gesse,
  And what it is, I wol now that thou see.
  I thenke, sith that love, of his goodnesse,
  Hath thee converted out of wikkednesse,
  That thou shalt be the beste post, I leve,                           1000
  Of al his lay, and most his foos to-greve.

  144. Ensample why, see now these wyse clerkes,
  That erren aldermost a-yein a lawe,
  And ben converted from hir wikked werkes
  Thorugh grace of god, that list hem to him drawe,                    1005
  Than arn they folk that han most god in awe,
  And strengest-feythed been, I understonde,
  And conne an errour alder-best withstonde.'

  145. Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented
  To been his help in loving of Criseyde,                              1010
  Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,
  But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde,
  With sobre chere, al-though his herte pleyde,
  'Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve,
  Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve.                           1015

  146. But, dere frend, how shal myn wo ben lesse
  Til this be doon? and goode, eek tel me this,
  How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse?
  Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, y-wis,
  Or nil not here or trowen how it is.                                 1020
  Al this drede I, and eek for the manere
  Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.'

  147. Quod Pandarus, 'thou hast a ful gret care
  Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone!
  Why, lord! I hate of thee thy nyce fare!                             1025
  Why, entremete of that thou hast to done!
  For goddes love, I bidde thee a bone,
  So lat me alone, and it shal be thy beste.'--
  'Why, freend,' quod he, 'now do right as thee leste.

  148. But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde                         1030
  That thou in me wendest so greet folye,
  That to my lady I desiren sholde
  That toucheth harm or any vilenye;
  For dredelees, me were lever dye
  Than she of me ought elles understode                                1035
  But that, that mighte sounen in-to gode.'

  149. Tho lough this Pandare, and anoon answerde,
  'And I thy borw? fy! no wight dooth but so;
  I roughte nought though that she stode and herde
  How that thou seyst; but fare-wel, I wol go.                         1040
  A-dieu! be glad! god spede us bothe two!
  Yif me this labour and this besinesse,
  And of my speed be thyn al that swetnesse.'

  150. Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle,
  And Pandare in his armes hente faste,                                1045
  And seyde, 'now, fy on the Grekes alle!
  Yet, pardee, god shal helpe us at the laste;
  And dredelees, if that my lyf may laste,
  And god to-forn, lo, som of hem shal smerte;
  And yet me athinketh that this avaunt me asterte!                    1050

  151. Now, Pandare, I can no more seye,
  But thou wys, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art al!
  My lyf, my deeth, hool in thyn honde I leye;
  Help now,' quod he. 'Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.'
  'God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,'                       1055
  Quod Troilus, 'that thou me recomaunde
  To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.'

  152. This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve
  His fulle freend, than seyde in this manere,
  'Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;                         1060
  Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.'--
  And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,
  And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,
  And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place.

  153. For every wight that hath an hous to founde                     1065
  Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne
  With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,
  And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne
  Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.
  Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,                               1070
  And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte.

  154. But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,
  But up anoon up-on his stede bay,
  And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;
  Wo was that Greek that with him mette that day.                      1075
  And in the toun his maner tho forth ay
  So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,
  That ech him lovede that loked on his face.

  155. For he bicom the frendlyeste wight,
  The gentileste, and eek the moste free,                              1080
  The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,
  That in his tyme was, or mighte be.
  Dede were his Iapes and his crueltee,
  His heighe port and his manere estraunge,
  And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge.                              1085

  156. Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,
  That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore,
  And is somdel of akinge of his wounde
  Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more:
  And, as an esy pacient, the lore                                     1090
  Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;
  And thus he dryveth forth his aventure.

BOOK II.

INCIPIT PROHEMIUM SECUNDI LIBRI.

  1. Out of these blake wawes for to sayle,
  O wind, O wind, the weder ginneth clere;
  For in this see the boot hath swich travayle,
  Of my conning that unnethe I it stere:
  This see clepe I the tempestous matere                                  5
  Of desespeyr that Troilus was inne:
  But now of hope the calendes biginne.

  2. O lady myn, that called art Cleo,
  Thou be my speed fro this forth, and my muse,
  To ryme wel this book, til I have do;                                  10
  Me nedeth here noon other art to use.
  For-why to every lovere I me excuse,
  That of no sentement I this endyte,
  But out of Latin in my tonge it wryte.

  3. Wherfore I nil have neither thank ne blame                          15
  Of al this werk, but pray yow mekely,
  Disblameth me, if any word be lame,
  For as myn auctor seyde, so seye I.
  Eek though I speke of love unfelingly,
  No wonder is, for it no-thing of newe is;                              20
  A blind man can nat Iuggen wel in hewis.

  4. Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge
  With-inne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho
  That hadden prys, now wonder nyce and straunge
  Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so,                            25
  And spedde as wel in love as men now do;
  Eek for to winne love in sondry ages,
  In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.

  5. And for-thy if it happe in any wyse,
  That here be any lovere in this place                                  30
  That herkeneth, as the story wol devyse,
  How Troilus com to his lady grace,
  And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace,
  Or wondreth on his speche and his doinge,
  I noot; but it is me no wonderinge;                                    35

  6. For every wight which that to Rome went,
  Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere;
  Eek in some lond were al the gamen shent,
  If that they ferde in love as men don here,
  As thus, in open doing or in chere,                                    40
  In visitinge, in forme, or seyde hir sawes;
  For-thy men seyn, ech contree hath his lawes.

  7. Eek scarsly been ther in this place three
  That han in love seyd lyk and doon in al;
  For to thy purpos this may lyken thee,                                 45
  And thee right nought, yet al is seyd or shal;
  Eek som men grave in tree, som in stoon wal,
  As it bitit; but sin I have begonne,
  Myn auctor shal I folwen, if I conne.

  8. In May, that moder is of monthes glade,                             50
  That fresshe floures, blewe, and whyte, and rede,
  Ben quike agayn, that winter dede made,
  And ful of bawme is fletinge every mede;
  Whan Phebus doth his brighte bemes sprede
  Right in the whyte Bole, it so bitidde                                 55
  As I shal singe, on Mayes day the thridde,

  9. That Pandarus, for al his wyse speche,
  Felte eek his part of loves shottes kene,
  That, coude he never so wel of loving preche,
  It made his hewe a-day ful ofte grene;                                 60
  So shoop it, that him fil that day a tene
  In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,
  And made, er it was day, ful many a wente.

  10. The swalwe Proignè, with a sorwful lay,
  Whan morwe com, gan make hir weymentinge,                              65
  Why she forshapen was; and ever lay
  Pandare a-bedde, half in a slomeringe,
  Til she so neigh him made hir chiteringe
  How Tereus gan forth hir suster take,
  That with the noyse of hir he gan a-wake;                              70

  11. And gan to calle, and dresse him up to ryse,
  Remembringe him his erand was to done
  From Troilus, and eek his greet empryse;
  And caste and knew in good plyt was the mone
  To doon viage, and took his wey ful sone                               75
  Un-to his neces paleys ther bi-syde;
  Now Ianus, god of entree, thou him gyde!

  12. Whan he was come un-to his neces place,
  'Wher is my lady?' to hir folk seyde he;
  And they him tolde; and he forth in gan pace,                          80
  And fond, two othere ladyes sete and she
  With-inne a paved parlour; and they three
  Herden a mayden reden hem the geste
  Of the Sege of Thebes, whyl hem leste.

  13. Quod Pandarus, 'ma dame, god yow see,                              85
  With al your book and al the companye!'
  'Ey, uncle myn, welcome y-wis,' quod she,
  And up she roos, and by the hond in hye
  She took him faste, and seyde, 'this night thrye,
  To goode mote it turne, of yow I mette!'                               90
  And with that word she doun on bench him sette.

  14. 'Ye, nece, ye shal fare wel the bet,
  If god wole, al this yeer,' quod Pandarus;
  'But I am sory that I have yow let
  To herknen of your book ye preysen thus;                               95
  For goddes love, what seith it? tel it us.
  Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!'
  'Uncle,' quod she, 'your maistresse is not here!'

  15. With that they gonnen laughe, and tho she seyde,
  'This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede;                            100
  And we han herd how that king Laius deyde
  Thurgh Edippus his sone, and al that dede;
  And here we stenten at these lettres rede,
  How the bisshop, as the book can telle,
  Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.'                           105

  16. Quod Pandarus, 'al this knowe I my-selve,
  And al the assege of Thebes and the care;
  For her-of been ther maked bokes twelve:--
  But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare;
  Do wey your barbe, and shew your face bare;                           110
  Do wey your book, rys up, and lat us daunce,
  And lat us don to May som observaunce.'

  17. 'A! god forbede!' quod she, 'be ye mad?'
  Is that a widewes lyf, so god you save?
  By god, ye maken me right sore a-drad,                                115
  Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave!
  It sete me wel bet ay in a cave
  To bidde, and rede on holy seyntes lyves:
  Lat maydens gon to daunce, and yonge wyves.'

  18. 'As ever thryve I,' quod this Pandarus,                           120
  'Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleye.'
  'Now uncle dere,' quod she, 'tel it us
  For goddes love; is than the assege aweye?
  I am of Grekes so ferd that I deye.'
  'Nay, nay,' quod he, 'as ever mote I thryve!                          125
  It is a thing wel bet than swiche fyve.'

  19. 'Ye, holy god!' quod she, 'what thing is that?
  What? bet than swiche fyve? ey, nay, y-wis!
  For al this world ne can I reden what
  It sholde been; som Iape, I trowe, is this;                           130
  And but your-selven telle us what it is,
  My wit is for to arede it al to lene;
  As help me god, I noot nat what ye mene.'

  20. 'And I your borow, ne never shal, for me,
  This thing be told to yow, as mote I thryve!'                         135
  'And why so, uncle myn? why so?' quod she.
  'By god,' quod he, 'that wole I telle as blyve;
  For prouder womman were ther noon on-lyve,
  And ye it wiste, in al the toun of Troye;
  I iape nought, as ever have I Ioye!'                                  140

  21. Tho gan she wondren more than biforn
  A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste;
  For never, sith the tyme that she was born,
  To knowe thing desired she so faste;
  And with a syk she seyde him at the laste,                            145
  'Now, uncle myn, I nil yow nought displese,
  Nor axen more, that may do yow disese.'

  22. So after this, with many wordes glade,
  And freendly tales, and with mery chere,
  Of this and that they pleyde, and gunnen wade                         150
  In many an unkouth glad and deep matere,
  As freendes doon, whan they ben met y-fere;
  Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde,
  That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde.

  23. 'Ful wel, I thanke it god,' quod Pandarus,                        155
  'Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde;
  And eek his fresshe brother Troilus,
  The wyse worthy Ector the secounde,
  In whom that every vertu list abounde,
  As alle trouthe and alle gentillesse,                                 160
  Wysdom, honour, fredom, and worthinesse.'

  24. 'In good feith, eem,' quod she, 'that lyketh me;
  They faren wel, god save hem bothe two!
  For trewely I holde it greet deyntee
  A kinges sone in armes wel to do,                                     165
  And been of good condiciouns ther-to;
  For greet power and moral vertu here
  Is selde y-seye in o persone y-fere.'

  25. 'In good feith, that is sooth,' quod Pandarus;
  But, by my trouthe, the king hath sones tweye,                        170
  That is to mene, Ector and Troilus,
  That certainly, though that I sholde deye,
  They been as voyde of vyces, dar I seye,
  As any men that liveth under the sonne,
  Hir might is wyde y-knowe, and what they conne.                       175

  26. Of Ector nedeth it nought for to telle;
  In al this world ther nis a bettre knight
  Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;
  And he wel more vertu hath than might.
  This knoweth many a wys and worthy wight.                             180
  The same prys of Troilus I seye,
  God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweye.'

  27. 'By god,' quod she, 'of Ector that is sooth;
  Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;
  For dredelees, men tellen that he dooth                               185
  In armes day by day so worthily,
  And bereth him here at hoom so gentilly
  To every wight, that al the prys hath he
  Of hem that me were levest preysed be.'

  28. 'Ye sey right sooth, y-wis,' quod Pandarus;                       190
  'For yesterday, who-so hadde with him been,
  He might have wondred up-on Troilus;
  For never yet so thikke a swarm of been
  Ne fleigh, as Grekes fro him gonne fleen;
  And thorugh the feld, in every wightes ere,                           195
  Ther nas no cry but "Troilus is there!"

  29. Now here, now there, he hunted hem so faste,
  Ther nas but Grekes blood; and Troilus,
  Now hem he hurte, and hem alle doun he caste;
  Ay where he wente it was arayed thus:                                 200
  He was hir deeth, and sheld and lyf for us;
  That as that day ther dorste noon with-stonde,
  Whyl that he held his blody swerd in honde.

  30. Therto he is the freendlieste man
  Of grete estat, that ever I saw my lyve;                              205
  And wher him list, best felawshipe can
  To suche as him thinketh able for to thryve.'
  And with that word tho Pandarus, as blyve,
  He took his leve, and seyde, 'I wol go henne:'
  'Nay, blame have I, myn uncle,' quod she thenne.                      210

  31. 'What eyleth yow to be thus wery sone,
  And namelich of wommen? wol ye so?
  Nay, sitteth down; by god, I have to done
  With yow, to speke of wisdom er ye go.'
  And every wight that was a-boute hem tho,                             215
  That herde that, gan fer a-wey to stonde,
  Whyl they two hadde al that hem liste in honde.

  32. Whan that hir tale al brought was to an ende
  Of hire estat and of hir governaunce,
  Quod Pandarus, 'now is it tyme I wende;                               220
  But yet, I seye, aryseth, lat us daunce,
  And cast your widwes habit to mischaunce:
  What list yow thus your-self to disfigure,
  Sith yow is tid thus fair an aventure?'

  33. 'A! wel bithought! for love of god,' quod she,                    225
  'Shal I not witen what ye mene of this?'
  'No, this thing axeth layser,' tho quod he,
  'And eek me wolde muche greve, y-wis,
  If I it tolde, and ye it toke amis.
  Yet were it bet my tonge for to stille                                230
  Than seye a sooth that were ayeins your wille.

  34. For, nece, by the goddesse Minerve,
  And Iuppiter, that maketh the thonder ringe,
  And by the blisful Venus that I serve,
  Ye been the womman in this world livinge,                             235
  With-oute paramours, to my witinge,
  That I best love, and lothest am to greve,
  And that ye witen wel your-self, I leve.'

  35. 'Y-wis, myn uncle,' quod she, 'grant mercy;
  Your freendship have I founden ever yit;                              240
  I am to no man holden trewely
  So muche as yow, and have so litel quit;
  And, with the grace of god, emforth my wit,
  As in my gilt I shal you never offende;
  And if I have er this, I wol amende.                                  245

  36. But, for the love of god, I yow beseche,
  As ye ben he that I most love and triste,
  Lat be to me your fremde maner speche,
  And sey to me, your nece, what yow liste:'
  And with that word hir uncle anoon hir kiste,                         250
  And seyde, 'gladly, leve nece dere,
  Tak it for good that I shal seye yow here.'

  37. With that she gan hir eyen doun to caste,
  And Pandarus to coghe gan a lyte,
  And seyde, 'nece, alwey, lo! to the laste,                            255
  How-so it be that som men hem delyte
  With subtil art hir tales for to endyte,
  Yet for al that, in hir entencioun,
  Hir tale is al for som conclusioun.

  38. And sithen thende is every tales strengthe,                       260
  And this matere is so bihovely,
  What sholde I peynte or drawen it on lengthe
  To yow, that been my freend so feithfully?'
  And with that word he gan right inwardly
  Biholden hir, and loken on hir face,                                  265
  And seyde, 'on suche a mirour goode grace!'

  39. Than thoughte he thus, 'if I my tale endyte
  Ought hard, or make a proces any whyle,
  She shal no savour han ther-in but lyte,
  And trowe I wolde hir in my wil bigyle.                               270
  For tendre wittes wenen al be wyle
  Ther-as they can nat pleynly understonde;
  For-thy hir wit to serven wol I fonde'--

  40. And loked on hir in a besy wyse,
  And she was war that he byheld hir so,                                275
  And seyde, 'lord! so faste ye me avyse!
  Sey ye me never er now? what sey ye, no?'
  'Yes, yes,' quod he, 'and bet wole er I go;
  But, by my trouthe, I thoughte now if ye
  Be fortunat, for now men shal it see.                                 280

  41. For to every wight som goodly aventure
  Som tyme is shape, if he it can receyven;
  And if that he wol take of it no cure,
  Whan that it cometh, but wilfully it weyven,
  Lo, neither cas nor fortune him deceyven,                             285
  But right his verray slouthe and wrecchednesse;
  And swich a wight is for to blame, I gesse.

  42. Good aventure, O bele nece, have ye
  Ful lightly founden, and ye conne it take;
  And, for the love of god, and eek of me,                              290
  Cacche it anoon, lest aventure slake.
  What sholde I lenger proces of it make?
  Yif me your hond, for in this world is noon,
  If that you list, a wight so wel begoon.

  43. And sith I speke of good entencioun,                              295
  As I to yow have told wel here-biforn,
  And love as wel your honour and renoun
  As creature in al this world y-born;
  By alle the othes that I have yow sworn,
  And ye be wrooth therfore, or wene I lye,                             300
  Ne shal I never seen yow eft with yë.

  44. Beth nought agast, ne quaketh nat; wher-to?
  Ne chaungeth nat for fere so your hewe;
  For hardely, the werste of this is do;
  And though my tale as now be to yow newe,                             305
  Yet trist alwey, ye shal me finde trewe;
  And were it thing that me thoughte unsittinge,
  To yow nolde I no swiche tales bringe.'

  45. 'Now, my good eem, for goddes love, I preye,'
  Quod she, 'com of, and tel me what it is;                             310
  For bothe I am agast what ye wol seye,
  And eek me longeth it to wite, y-wis.
  For whether it be wel or be amis,
  Sey on, lat me not in this fere dwelle:'
  'So wol I doon, now herkneth, I shal telle:                           315

  46. Now, nece myn, the kinges dere sone,
  The goode, wyse, worthy, fresshe, and free,
  Which alwey for to do wel is his wone,
  The noble Troilus, so loveth thee,
  That, bot ye helpe, it wol his bane be.                               320
  Lo, here is al, what sholde I more seye?
  Doth what yow list, to make him live or deye.

  47. But if ye lete him deye, I wol sterve;
  Have her my trouthe, nece, I nil not lyen;
  Al sholde I with this knyf my throte kerve'--                         325
  With that the teres braste out of his yën,
  And seyde, 'if that ye doon us bothe dyen,
  Thus giltelees, than have ye fisshed faire;
  What mende ye, though that we bothe apeyre?

  48. Allas! he which that is my lord so dere,                          330
  That trewe man, that noble gentil knight,
  That nought desireth but your freendly chere,
  I see him deye, ther he goth up-right,
  And hasteth him, with al his fulle might,
  For to be slayn, if fortune wol assente;                              335
  Allas! that god yow swich a beautee sente!

  49. If it be so that ye so cruel be,
  That of his deeth yow liste nought to recche,
  That is so trewe and worthy, as ye see,
  No more than of a Iapere or a wrecche,                                340
  If ye be swich, your beautee may not strecche
  To make amendes of so cruel a dede;
  Avysement is good bifore the nede.

  50. Wo worth the faire gemme vertulees!
  Wo worth that herbe also that dooth no bote!                          345
  Wo worth that beautee that is routhelees!
  Wo worth that wight that tret ech under fote!
  And ye, that been of beautee crop and rote,
  If therwith-al in you ther be no routhe,
  Than is it harm ye liven, by my trouthe!                              350

  51. And also thenk wel, that this is no gaude;
  For me were lever, thou and I and he
  Were hanged, than I sholde been his baude,
  As heyghe, as men mighte on us alle y-see:
  I am thyn eem, the shame were to me,                                  355
  As wel as thee, if that I sholde assente,
  Thorugh myn abet, that he thyn honour shente.

  52. Now understond, for I yow nought requere,
  To binde yow to him thorugh no beheste,
  But only that ye make him bettre chere                                360
  Than ye han doon er this, and more feste,
  So that his lyf be saved, at the leste:
  This al and som, and playnly our entente;
  God helpe me so, I never other mente.

  53. Lo, this request is not but skile, y-wis,                         365
  Ne doute of reson, pardee, is ther noon.
  I sette the worste that ye dredden this,
  Men wolden wondren seen him come or goon:
  Ther-ayeins answere I thus a-noon,
  That every wight, but he be fool of kinde,                            370
  Wol deme it love of freendship in his minde.

  54. What? who wol deme, though he see a man
  To temple go, that he the images eteth?
  Thenk eek how wel and wysly that he can
  Governe him-self, that he no-thing foryeteth,                         375
  That, wher he cometh, he prys and thank him geteth;
  And eek ther-to, he shal come here so selde,
  What fors were it though al the toun behelde?

  55. Swich love of freendes regneth al this toun;
  And wrye yow in that mantel ever-mo;                                  380
  And, god so wis be my savacioun,
  As I have seyd, your beste is to do so.
  But alwey, goode nece, to stinte his wo,
  So lat your daunger sucred ben a lyte,
  That of his deeth ye be nought for to wyte.'                          385

  56. Criseyde, which that herde him in this wyse,
  Thoughte, 'I shal fele what he meneth, y-wis.'
  'Now, eem,' quod she, 'what wolde ye devyse,
  What is your reed I sholde doon of this?'
  'That is wel seyd,' quod he, 'certayn, best is                        390
  That ye him love ayein for his lovinge,
  As love for love is skilful guerdoninge.

  57. Thenk eek, how elde wasteth every houre
  In eche of yow a party of beautee;
  And therfore, er that age thee devoure,                               395
  Go love, for, olde, ther wol no wight of thee.
  Lat this proverbe a lore un-to yow be;
  "To late y-war, quod Beautee, whan it paste;"
  And elde daunteth daunger at the laste.

  58. The kinges fool is woned to cryen loude,                          400
  Whan that him thinketh a womman bereth hir hyë,
  "So longe mote ye live, and alle proude,
  Til crowes feet be growe under your yë,
  And sende yow thanne a mirour in to pryë
  In whiche ye may see your face a-morwe!"                              405
  Nece, I bidde wisshe yow no more sorwe.'

  59. With this he stente, and caste adoun the heed,
  And she bigan to breste a-wepe anoon.
  And seyde, 'allas, for wo! why nere I deed?
  For of this world the feith is al agoon!                              410
  Allas! what sholden straunge to me doon,
  When he, that for my beste freend I wende,
  Ret me to love, and sholde it me defende?

  60. Allas! I wolde han trusted, doutelees,
  That if that I, thurgh my disaventure,                                415
  Had loved other him or Achilles,
  Ector, or any mannes creature,
  Ye nolde han had no mercy ne mesure
  On me, but alwey had me in repreve;
  This false world, allas! who may it leve?                             420

  61. What? is this al the Ioye and al the feste?
  Is this your reed, is this my blisful cas?
  Is this the verray mede of your beheste?
  Is al this peynted proces seyd, allas!
  Right for this fyn? O lady myn, Pallas!                               425
  Thou in this dredful cas for me purveye;
  For so astonied am I that I deye!'

  62. With that she gan ful sorwfully to syke;
  'A! may it be no bet?' quod Pandarus;
  'By god, I shal no-more com here this wyke,                           430
  And god to-forn, that am mistrusted thus;
  I see ful wel that ye sette lyte of us,
  Or of our deeth! Allas! I woful wrecche!
  Mighte he yet live, of me is nought to recche.

  63. O cruel god, O dispitouse Marte,                                  435
  O Furies three of helle, on yow I crye!
  So lat me never out of this hous departe,
  If that I mente harm or vilanye!
  But sith I see my lord mot nedes dye,
  And I with him, here I me shryve, and seye                            440
  That wikkedly ye doon us bothe deye.

  64. But sith it lyketh yow that I be deed,
  By Neptunus, that god is of the see,
  Fro this forth shal I never eten breed
  Til I myn owene herte blood may see;                                  445
  For certayn, I wole deye as sone as he'--
  And up he sterte, and on his wey he raughte,
  Til she agayn him by the lappe caughte.

  65. Criseyde, which that wel neigh starf for fere,
  So as she was the ferfulleste wight                                   450
  That mighte be, and herde eek with hir ere,
  And saw the sorwful ernest of the knight,
  And in his preyere eek saw noon unright,
  And for the harm that mighte eek fallen more,
  She gan to rewe, and dradde hir wonder sore;                          455

  66. And thoughte thus, 'unhappes fallen thikke
  Alday for love, and in swich maner cas,
  As men ben cruel in hem-self and wikke;
  And if this man slee here him-self, allas!
  In my presence, it wol be no solas.                                   460
  What men wolde of hit deme I can nat seye;
  It nedeth me ful sleyly for to pleye.'

  67. And with a sorwful syk she seyde thrye,
  'A! lord! what me is tid a sory chaunce!
  For myn estat now lyth in Iupartye,                                   465
  And eek myn emes lyf lyth in balaunce;
  But nathelees, with goddes governaunce,
  I shal so doon, myn honour shal I kepe,
  And eek his lyf;' and stinte for to wepe.

  68. 'Of harmes two, the lesse is for to chese;                        470
  Yet have I lever maken him good chere
  In honour, than myn emes lyf to lese;
  Ye seyn, ye no-thing elles me requere?'
  'No, wis,' quod he, 'myn owene nece dere.'
  'Now wel,' quod she, 'and I wol doon my peyne;                        475
  I shal myn herte ayeins my lust constreyne,

  69. But that I nil not holden him in honde,
  Ne love a man, ne can I not, ne may
  Ayeins my wil; but elles wol I fonde,
  Myn honour sauf, plese him fro day to day;                            480
  Ther-to nolde I nought ones have seyd nay,
  But that I dredde, as in my fantasye;
  But cesse cause, ay cesseth maladye.

  70. And here I make a protestacioun,
  That in this proces if ye depper go,                                  485
  That certaynly, for no savacioun
  Of yow, though that ye sterve bothe two,
  Though al the world on o day be my fo,
  Ne shal I never on him han other routhe.'--
  'I graunte wel,' quod Pandare, 'by my trouthe.                        490

  71. But may I truste wel ther-to,' quod he,
  'That, of this thing that ye han hight me here,
  Ye wol it holden trewly un-to me?'
  'Ye, doutelees,' quod she, 'myn uncle dere.'
  'Ne that I shal han cause in this matere,'                            495
  Quod he, 'to pleyne, or after yow to preche?'
  'Why, no, pardee; what nedeth more speche?'

  72. Tho fillen they in othere tales glade,
  Til at the laste, 'O good eem,' quod she tho,
  'For love of god, which that us bothe made,                           500
  Tel me how first ye wisten of his wo:
  Wot noon of hit but ye?' He seyde, 'no.'
  'Can he wel speke of love?' quod she, 'I preye,
  Tel me, for I the bet me shal purveye.'

  73. Tho Pandarus a litel gan to smyle,                                505
  And seyde, 'by my trouthe, I shal yow telle.
  This other day, nought gon ful longe whyle,
  In-with the paleys-gardyn, by a welle,
  Gan he and I wel half a day to dwelle,
  Right for to speken of an ordenaunce,                                 510
  How we the Grekes mighte disavaunce.

  74. Sone after that bigonne we to lepe,
  And casten with our dartes to and fro,
  Til at the laste he seyde, he wolde slepe,
  And on the gres a-doun he leyde him tho;                              515
  And I after gan rome to and fro
  Til that I herde, as that I welk allone,
  How he bigan ful wofully to grone.

  75. Tho gan I stalke him softely bihinde,
  And sikerly, the sothe for to seyne,                                  520
  As I can clepe ayein now to my minde,
  Right thus to Love he gan him for to pleyne;
  He seyde, "lord! have routhe up-on my peyne,
  Al have I been rebel in myn entente;
  Now, _mea culpa_, lord! I me repente.                                 525

  76. O god, that at thy disposicioun
  Ledest the fyn, by Iuste purveyaunce,
  Of every wight, my lowe confessioun
  Accepte in gree, and send me swich penaunce
  As lyketh thee, but from desesperaunce,                               530
  That may my goost departe awey fro thee,
  Thou be my sheld, for thy benignitee.

  77. For certes, lord, so sore hath she me wounded
  That stod in blak, with loking of hir yën,
  That to myn hertes botme it is y-sounded,                             535
  Thorugh which I woot that I mot nedes dyen;
  This is the worste, I dar me not bi-wryen;
  And wel the hotter been the gledes rede,
  That men hem wryen with asshen pale and dede."

  78. With that he smoot his heed adoun anoon,                          540
  And gan to motre, I noot what, trewely.
  And I with that gan stille awey to goon,
  And leet ther-of as no-thing wist hadde I,
  And come ayein anoon and stood him by,
  And seyde, "a-wake, ye slepen al to longe;                            545
  It semeth nat that love dooth yow longe,

  79. That slepen so that no man may yow wake.
  Who sey ever or this so dul a man?"
  "Ye, freend," quod he, "do ye your hedes ake
  For love, and lat me liven as I can."                                 550
  But though that he for wo was pale and wan,
  Yet made he tho as fresh a contenaunce,
  As though he shulde have led the newe daunce.

  80. This passed forth, til now, this other day,
  It fel that I com roming al allone                                    555
  Into his chaumbre, and fond how that he lay
  Up-on his bed; but man so sore grone
  Ne herde I never, and what that was his mone,
  Ne wiste I nought; for, as I was cominge,
  Al sodeynly he lefte his compleyninge.                                560

  81. Of which I took somwhat suspecioun,
  And neer I com, and fond he wepte sore;
  And god so wis be my savacioun,
  As never of thing hadde I no routhe more.
  For neither with engyn, ne with no lore,                              565
  Unethes mighte I fro the deeth him kepe;
  That yet fele I myn herte for him wepe.

  82. And god wot, never, sith that I was born,
  Was I so bisy no man for to preche,
  Ne never was to wight so depe y-sworn,                                570
  Or he me tolde who mighte been his leche.
  But now to yow rehersen al his speche,
  Or alle his woful wordes for to soune,
  Ne bid me not, but ye wol see me swowne.

  83. But for to save his lyf, and elles nought,                        575
  And to non harm of yow, thus am I driven;
  And for the love of god that us hath wrought,
  Swich chere him dooth, that he and I may liven.
  Now have I plat to yow myn herte schriven;
  And sin ye woot that myn entente is clene,                            580
  Tak hede ther-of, for I non yvel mene.

  84. And right good thrift, I pray to god, have ye,
  That han swich oon y-caught with-oute net;
  And be ye wys, as ye ben fair to see,
  Wel in the ring than is the ruby set.                                 585
  Ther were never two so wel y-met,
  Whan ye ben his al hool, as he is youre:
  Ther mighty god yet graunte us see that houre!'

  85. 'Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!' quod she,
  'As helpe me god, ye shenden every deel!'                             590
  'O mercy, dere nece,' anoon quod he,
  'What-so I spak, I mente nought but weel,
  By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel;
  Now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.'
  'Now wel,' quod she, 'foryeven be it here!'                           595

  86. With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente;
  And lord, how he was glad and wel bigoon!
  Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente,
  But straught in-to hir closet wente anoon,
  And sette here doun as stille as any stoon,                           600
  And every word gan up and doun to winde,
  That he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde;

  87. And wex somdel astonied in hir thought,
  Right for the newe cas; but whan that she
  Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought                             605
  Of peril, why she oughte afered be.
  For man may love, of possibilitee,
  A womman so, his herte may to-breste,
  And she nought love ayein, but-if hir leste.

  88. But as she sat allone and thoughte thus,                          610
  Thascry aroos at skarmish al with-oute,
  And men cryde in the strete, 'see, Troilus
  Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!'
  With that gan al hir meynee for to shoute,
  'A! go we see, caste up the latis wyde;                               615
  For thurgh this strete he moot to palays ryde;

  89. For other wey is fro the yate noon
  Of Dardanus, ther open is the cheyne.'
  With that com he and al his folk anoon
  An esy pas rydinge, in routes tweyne,                                 620
  Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne,
  For which, men say, may nought disturbed be
  That shal bityden of necessitee.

  90. This Troilus sat on his baye stede,
  Al armed, save his heed, ful richely,                                 625
  And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
  On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;
  But swych a knightly sighte, trewely,
  As was on him, was nought, with-outen faile,
  To loke on Mars, that god is of batayle.                              630

  91. So lyk a man of armes and a knight
  He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse;
  For bothe he hadde a body and a might
  To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse;
  And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,                           635
  So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,
  It was an heven up-on him for to see.

  92. His helm to-hewen was in twenty places,
  That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,
  His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces,                      640
  In which men mighte many an arwe finde
  That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;
  And ay the peple cryde, 'here cometh our Ioye,
  And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!'

  93. For which he wex a litel reed for shame,                          645
  Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen,
  That to biholde it was a noble game,
  How sobreliche he caste doun his yën.
  Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen,
  And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,                              650
  That to hir-self she seyde, 'who yaf me drinke?'

  94. For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
  Remembringe hir right thus, 'lo, this is he
  Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed,
  But I on him have mercy and pitee;'                                   655
  And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she
  Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
  Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste,

  95. And gan to caste and rollen up and doun
  With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse,                         660
  And his estat, and also his renoun,
  His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
  But most hir favour was, for his distresse
  Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe
  To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe.                         665

  96. Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus,
  'This was a sodeyn love, how mighte it be
  That she so lightly lovede Troilus
  Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?'
  Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee!                              670
  For every thing, a ginning hath it nede
  Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede.

  97. For I sey nought that she so sodeynly
  Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne
  To lyke him first, and I have told yow why;                           675
  And after that, his manhod and his pyne
  Made love with-inne hir for to myne,
  For which, by proces and by good servyse,
  He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse.

  98. And also blisful Venus, wel arayed,                               680
  Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho,
  Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,
  To helpen sely Troilus of his wo.
  And, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo
  To Troilus in his nativitee;                                          685
  God woot that wel the soner spedde he.

  99. Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,
  That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste
  Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
  Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste                              690
  Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste,
  If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,
  For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse.

  100. And, lord! so she gan in hir thought argue
  In this matere of which I have yow told,                              695
  And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
  That plyted she ful ofte in many fold.
  Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
  And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte,
  As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte.                               700

  101. She thoughte wel, that Troilus persone
  She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
  And thus she seyde, 'al were it nought to done,
  To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
  It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,                         705
  In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,
  For myn estat, and also for his hele.

  102. Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
  And sith he hath to see me swich delyt,
  If I wolde utterly his sighte flee,                                   710
  Paraunter he mighte have me in dispyt,
  Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt;
  Now were I wys, me hate to purchace,
  With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace?

  103. In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure.                        715
  For though a man forbede dronkenesse,
  He nought for-bet that every creature
  Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;
  Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,
  I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse,                           720
  Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse.

  104. And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon,
  His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce.
  Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, is he noon;
  To wys is he to do so gret a vyce;                                    725
  Ne als I nel him never so cheryce,
  That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause;
  He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.

  105. Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis,
  Men mighten deme that he loveth me:                                   730
  What dishonour were it un-to me, this?
  May I him lette of that? why nay, pardee!
  I knowe also, and alday here and see,
  Men loven wommen al this toun aboute;
  Be they the wers? why, nay, with-outen doute.                         735

  106. I thenk eek how he able is for to have
  Of al this noble toun the thriftieste,
  To been his love, so she hir honour save;
  For out and out he is the worthieste,
  Save only Ector, which that is the beste.                             740
  And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure,
  But swich is love, and eek myn aventure.

  107. Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;
  For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede,
  Al wolde I that noon wistë of this thought,                           745
  I am oon the fayreste, out of drede,
  And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede;
  And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.
  What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye?

  108. I am myn owene woman, wel at ese,                                750
  I thank it god, as after myn estat;
  Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese,
  With-outen Ialousye or swich debat;
  Shal noon housbonde seyn to me "chekmat!"
  For either they ben ful of Ialousye,                                  755
  Or maisterful, or loven novelrye.

  109. What shal I doon? to what fyn live I thus?
  Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste?
  What, _par dieux_! I am nought religious!
  And though that I myn herte sette at reste                            760
  Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
  And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,
  By alle right, it may do me no shame.'

  110. But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte,
  In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,                          765
  And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
  Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,
  A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,
  That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
  So that for fere almost she gan to falle.                             770

  111. That thought was this, 'allas! sin I am free,
  Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye
  My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee?
  Allas! how dorste I thenken that folye?
  May I nought wel in other folk aspye                                  775
  Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne?
  Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne.

  112. For love is yet the moste stormy lyf,
  Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne;
  For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf,                                 780
  Ther is in love, som cloud is over the sonne:
  Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne,
  Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;
  Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke.

  113. Also these wikked tonges been so prest                           785
  To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,
  That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,
  So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
  But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe.
  For though these men for love hem first to-rende,                     790
  Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende.

  114. How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be,
  The treson, that to womman hath be do?
  To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see,
  Or wher bicomth it, whan it is ago;                                   795
  Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,
  Wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth;
  That erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth.

  115. How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be
  To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen,                         800
  And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me?
  For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen
  Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;
  And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,
  Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?'                           805

  116. And after that, hir thought bigan to clere,
  And seyde, 'he which that no-thing under-taketh,
  No-thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.'
  And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
  Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh;                           810
  Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye,
  She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye.

  117. Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente
  In-to the gardin, with hir neces three,
  And up and doun ther made many a wente,                               815
  Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,
  To pleyen, that it Ioye was to see;
  And othere of hir wommen, a gret route,
  Hir folwede in the gardin al aboute.

  118. This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes,                 820
  And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
  And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes,
  In which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene;
  Til at the laste Antigone the shene
  Gan on a Troian song to singe clere,                                  825
  That it an heven was hir voys to here.--

  119. She seyde, 'O love, to whom I have and shal
  Ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente,
  As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al
  For ever-more, myn hertes lust to rente.                              830
  For never yet thy grace no wight sente
  So blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede
  In alle Ioye and seurtee, out of drede.

  120. Ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset
  In love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf                               835
  Imaginen ne cowde how to ben bet;
  For, lord, with-outen Ialousye or stryf,
  I love oon which that is most ententyf
  To serven wel, unwery or unfeyned,
  That ever was, and leest with harm distreyned.                        840

  121. As he that is the welle of worthinesse,
  Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed,
  Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse,
  Of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed,
  Thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed,                               845
  Y-wis, I love him best, so doth he me;
  Now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be!

  122. Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,
  Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne?
  And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love!                             850
  This is the righte lyf that I am inne,
  To flemen alle manere vyce and sinne:
  This doth me so to vertu for to entende,
  That day by day I in my wil amende.

  123. And who-so seyth that for to love is vyce,                       855
  Or thraldom, though he fele in it distressse,
  He outher is envyous, or right nyce,
  Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse,
  To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,
  Defamen love, as no-thing of him knowe;                               860
  They speken, but they bente never his bowe.

  124. What is the sonne wers, of kinde righte,
  Though that a man, for feblesse of his yën,
  May nought endure on it to see for brighte?
  Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen?                        865
  No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen.
  And for-thy, who that hath an heed of verre,
  Fro cast of stones war him in the werre!

  125. But I with al myn herte and al my might,
  As I have seyd, wol love, un-to my laste,                             870
  My dere herte, and al myn owene knight,
  In which myn herte growen is so faste,
  And his in me, that it shal ever laste.
  Al dredde I first to love him to biginne,
  Now woot I wel, ther is no peril inne.'                               875

  126. And of hir song right with that word she stente,
  And therwith-al, 'now, nece,' quod Criseyde,
  'Who made this song with so good entente?'
  Antigone answerde anoon, and seyde,
  'Ma dame, y-wis, the goodlieste mayde                                 880
  Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye;
  And let hir lyf in most honour and Ioye.'

  127. 'Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,'
  Quod tho Criseyde, and gan ther-with to syke,
  And seyde, 'lord, is there swich blisse among                         885
  These lovers, as they conne faire endyte?'
  'Ye, wis,' quod fresh Antigone the whyte,
  'For alle the folk that han or been on lyve
  Ne conne wel the blisse of love discryve.

  128. But wene ye that every wrecche woot                              890
  The parfit blisse of love? why, nay, y-wis;
  They wenen al be love, if oon be hoot;
  Do wey, do wey, they woot no-thing of this!
  Men mosten axe at seyntes if it is
  Aught fair in hevene; why? for they conne telle;                      895
  And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.'

  129. Criseyde un-to that purpos nought answerde,
  But seyde, 'y-wis, it wol be night as faste.'
  But every word which that she of hir herde,
  She gan to prenten in hir herte faste;                                900
  And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste
  Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,
  That she wex somwhat able to converte.

  130. The dayes honour, and the hevenes yë,
  The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne,                            905
  Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrye,
  As he that hadde his dayes cours y-ronne;
  And whyte thinges wexen dimme and donne
  For lak of light, and sterres for to appere,
  That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere.                             910

  131. So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste,
  And voyded weren they that voyden oughte,
  She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste.
  Hir wommen sone til hir bed hir broughte.
  Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte                   915
  Of al this thing the manere and the wyse.
  Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse.

  132. A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
  Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay,
  Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,                                  920
  Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay
  Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay.
  That herkned she so longe in good entente,
  Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente.

  133. And, as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette,                    925
  How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon,
  Under hir brest his longe clawes sette,
  And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon,
  And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon,
  Of which she nought agroos ne no-thing smerte,                        930
  And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte.

  134. Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde
  Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden,
  Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde,
  And in his chambre sit, and hath abiden                               935
  Til two or three of his messages yeden
  For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,
  Til they him founde, and broughte him at the laste.

  135. This Pandarus com leping in at ones
  And seide thus, 'who hath ben wel y-bete                              940
  To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,
  But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?'
  And gan to Iape, and seyde, 'lord, so ye swete!
  But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;'
  And he answerde him, 'do we as thee leste.'                           945

  136. With al the haste goodly that they mighte,
  They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde;
  And every wight out at the dore him dighte,
  And wher him list upon his wey he spedde;
  But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde                           950
  For wo, til that he herde som tydinge,
  He seyde, 'freend, shal I now wepe or singe?'

  137. Quod Pandarus, 'ly stille, and lat me slepe,
  And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be;
  And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;                      955
  At shorte wordes, thow shall trowe me.--
  Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,
  And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe,
  But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe.

  138. For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,                       960
  Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,
  Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,
  And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe.
  Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.'
  What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde?                              965
  As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde.

  139. But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night
  Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalkes lowe,
  Redressen hem a-yein the sonne bright,
  And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe;                               970
  Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
  This Troilus, and seyde, 'O Venus dere,
  Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!'

  140. And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
  And seyde, 'lord, al thyn be that I have;                             975
  For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;
  A thousand Troians who so that me yave,
  Eche after other, god so wis me save,
  Ne mighte me so gladen; lo, myn herte,
  It spredeth so for Ioye, it wol to-sterte!                            980

  141. But lord, how shal I doon, how shal I liven?
  Whan shal I next my dere herte see?
  How shal this longe tyme a-wey be driven,
  Til that thou be ayein at hir fro me?
  Thou mayst answere, "a-byd, a-byd," but he                            985
  That hangeth by the nekke, sooth to seyne,
  In grete disese abydeth for the peyne.'

  142. 'Al esily, now, for the love of Marte,'
  Quod Pandarus, 'for every thing hath tyme;
  So longe abyd til that the night departe;                             990
  For al so siker as thow lyst here by me,
  And god toforn, I wol be there at pryme,
  And for thy werk somwhat as I shal seye,
  Or on som other wight this charge leye.

  143. For pardee, god wot, I have ever yit                             995
  Ben redy thee to serve, and to this night
  Have I nought fayned, but emforth my wit
  Don al thy lust, and shal with al my might.
  Do now as I shal seye, and fare a-right;
  And if thou nilt, wyte al thy-self thy care,                         1000
  On me is nought along thyn yvel fare.

  144. I woot wel that thow wyser art than I
  A thousand fold, but if I were as thou,
  God helpe me so, as I wolde outrely,
  Right of myn owene hond, wryte hir right now                         1005
  A lettre, in which I wolde hir tellen how
  I ferde amis, and hir beseche of routhe;
  Now help thy-self, and leve it not for slouthe.

  145. And I my-self shal ther-with to hir goon;
  And whan thou wost that I am with hir there,                         1010
  Worth thou up-on a courser right anoon,
  Ye, hardily, right in thy beste gere,
  And ryd forth by the place, as nought ne were,
  And thou shalt finde us, if I may, sittinge
  At som windowe, in-to the strete lokinge.                            1015

  146. And if thee list, than maystow us saluwe,
  And up-on me makë thy contenaunce;
  But, by thy lyf, be war and faste eschuwe
  To tarien ought, god shilde us fro mischaunce!
  Ryd forth thy wey, and hold thy governaunce;                         1020
  And we shal speke of thee som-what, I trowe,
  Whan thou art goon, to do thyne eres glowe!

  147. Touching thy lettre, thou art wys y-nough,
  I woot thow nilt it digneliche endyte;
  As make it with thise argumentes tough;                              1025
  Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte;
  Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte;
  And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe,
  Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte.

  148. For though the beste harpour upon lyve                          1030
  Wolde on the beste souned Ioly harpe
  That ever was, with alle his fingres fyve,
  Touche ay o streng, or ay o werbul harpe,
  Were his nayles poynted never so sharpe,
  It shulde maken every wight to dulle,                                1035
  To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle.

  149. Ne Iompre eek no discordaunt thing y-fere,
  As thus, to usen termes of phisyk;
  In loves termes, hold of thy matere
  The forme alwey, and do that it be lyk;                              1040
  For if a peyntour wolde peynte a pyk
  With asses feet, and hede it as an ape,
  It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.'

  150. This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus;
  But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this:--                           1045
  'Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,
  I am ashamed for to wryte, y-wis,
  Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis,
  Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve;
  Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.'                  1050

  151. To that Pandare answerde, 'if thee lest,
  Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon;
  For by that lord that formed est and west,
  I hope of it to bringe answere anoon
  Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,                       1055
  Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve,
  Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.'

  152. Quod Troilus, '_Depardieux_, I assente;
  Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte;
  And blisful god preye ich, with good entente,                        1060
  The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte,
  So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte,
  Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:'
  And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse.--

  153. First he gan hir his righte lady calle,                         1065
  His hertes lyf, his lust, his sorwes leche,
  His blisse, and eek this othere termes alle,
  That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;
  And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche,
  He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace;                               1070
  To telle al how, it axeth muchel space.

  154. And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde
  To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye,
  So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde,
  That love it made, or elles moste he dye,                            1075
  And pitously gan mercy for to crye;
  And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude,
  Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude;

  155. And that she sholde han his conning excused,
  That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,                            1080
  And his unworthinesse he ay acused;
  And after that, than gan he telle his wo;
  But that was endeles, with-outen ho;
  And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde;--
  And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde.                         1085

  156. And with his salte teres gan he bathe
  The ruby in his signet, and it sette
  Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;
  Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette,
  He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,                              1090
  And seyde, 'lettre, a blisful destenee
  Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.'

  157. This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme
  A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte,
  And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme,                        1095
  And gan to Iape, and seyde, 'y-wis, myn herte,
  So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte,
  I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe;
  I have a Ioly wo, a lusty sorwe.'

  158. Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,                        1100
  With dreedful herte, and desirous to here
  The cause of his cominge, thus answerde,
  'Now by your feyth, myn uncle,' quod she, 'dere,
  What maner windes gydeth yow now here?
  Tel us your Ioly wo and your penaunce,                               1105
  How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.'

  159. 'By god,' quod he, 'I hoppe alwey bihinde!'
  And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste.
  Quod Pandarus, 'loke alwey that ye finde
  Game in myn hood, but herkneth, if yow leste;                        1110
  Ther is right now come in-to toune a geste,
  A Greek espye, and telleth newe thinges,
  For which come I to telle yow tydinges.

  160. Into the gardin go we, and we shal here,
  Al prevely, of this a long sermoun.'                                 1115
  With that they wenten arm in arm y-fere
  In-to the gardin from the chaumbre doun.
  And whan that he so fer was that the soun
  Of that he speke, no man here mighte,
  He seyde hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,                       1120

  161. 'Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free
  Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,
  And sent to you this lettre here by me;
  Avyseth you on it, whan ye han space,
  And of som goodly answere yow purchace;                              1125
  Or, helpe me god, so pleynly for to seyne,
  He may not longe liven for his peyne.'

  162. Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,
  And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
  Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, 'scrit ne bille,                      1130
  For love of god, that toucheth swich matere,
  Ne bring me noon; and also, uncle dere,
  To myn estat have more reward, I preye,
  Than to his lust; what sholde I more seye?

  163. And loketh now if this be resonable,                            1135
  And letteth nought, for favour ne for slouthe,
  To seyn a sooth; now were it covenable
  To myn estat, by god, and by your trouthe,
  To taken it, or to han of him routhe,
  In harming of my-self or in repreve?                                 1140
  Ber it a-yein, for him that ye on leve!'

  164. This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,
  And seyde, 'now is this the grettest wonder
  That ever I sey! lat be this nyce fare!
  To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder,                             1145
  If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder,
  Wolde I a lettre un-to yow bringe or take
  To harm of yow; what list yow thus it make?

  165. But thus ye faren, wel neigh alle and some,
  That he that most desireth yow to serve,                             1150
  Of him ye recche leest wher he bicome,
  And whether that he live or elles sterve.
  But for al that that ever I may deserve,
  Refuse it nought,' quod he, and hente hir faste,
  And in hir bosom the lettre doun he thraste,                         1155

  166. And seyde hir, 'now cast it away anoon,
  That folk may seen and gauren on us tweye.'
  Quod she, 'I can abyde til they be goon,'
  And gan to smyle, and seyde him, 'eem, I preye,
  Swich answere as yow list your-self purveye,                         1160
  For trewely I nil no lettre wryte.'
  'No? than wol I,' quod he, 'so ye endyte.'

  167. Therwith she lough, and seyde, 'go we dyne.'
  And he gan at him-self to iape faste,
  And seyde, 'nece, I have so greet a pyne                             1165
  For love, that every other day I faste'--
  And gan his beste Iapes forth to caste;
  And made hir so to laughe at his folye,
  That she for laughter wende for to dye.

  168. And whan that she was comen in-to halle,                        1170
  'Now, eem,' quod she, 'we wol go dyne anoon;'
  And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
  And streyght in-to hir chaumbre gan she goon;
  But of hir besinesses, this was oon
  A-monges othere thinges, out of drede,                               1175
  Ful prively this lettre for to rede;

  169. Avysed word by word in every lyne,
  And fond no lak, she thoughte he coude good;
  And up it putte, and went hir in to dyne.
  And Pandarus, that in a study stood,                                 1180
  Er he was war, she took him by the hood,
  And seyde, 'ye were caught er that ye wiste;'
  'I vouche sauf,' quod he, 'do what yow liste.'

  170. Tho wesshen they, and sette hem doun and ete;
  And after noon ful sleyly Pandarus                                   1185
  Gan drawe him to the window next the strete,
  And seyde, 'nece, who hath arayed thus
  The yonder hous, that stant afor-yeyn us?'
  'Which hous?' quod she, and gan for to biholde,
  And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde,                          1190

  171. And fillen forth in speche of thinges smale,
  And seten in the window bothe tweye.
  Whan Pandarus saw tyme un-to his tale,
  And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye,
  'Now, nece myn, tel on,' quod he, 'I seye,                           1195
  How lyketh yow the lettre that ye woot?
  Can he ther-on? for, by my trouthe, I noot.'

  172. Therwith al rosy hewed tho wex she,
  And gan to humme, and seyde, 'so I trowe.'
  'Aquyte him wel, for goddes love,' quod he;                          1200
  'My-self to medes wol the lettre sowe,'
  And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe,
  'Now, goode nece, be it never so lyte,
  Yif me the labour, it to sowe and plyte.'

  173. 'Ye, for I can so wryte,' quod she tho;                         1205
  'And eek I noot what I sholde to him seye.'
  'Nay, nece,' quod Pandare, 'sey not so;
  Yet at the leste thanketh him, I preye,
  Of his good wil, and doth him not to deye.
  Now for the love of me, my nece dere,                                1210
  Refuseth not at this tyme my preyere.'

  174. '_Depar-dieux_,' quod she, 'god leve al be wel!
  God helpe me so, this is the firste lettre
  That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.'
  And in-to a closet, for to avyse hir bettre,                         1215
  She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre
  Out of disdaynes prison but a lyte;
  And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre wryte,

  175. Of which to telle in short is myn entente
  Theffect, as fer as I can understonde:--                             1220
  She thonked him of al that he wel mente
  Towardes hir, but holden him in honde
  She nolde nought, ne make hir-selven bonde
  In love, but as his suster, him to plese,
  She wolde fayn, to doon his herte an ese.                            1225

  176. She shette it, and to Pandarus gan goon,
  There as he sat and loked in-to strete,
  And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
  Of Iaspre, up-on a quisshin gold y-bete,
  And seyde, 'as wisly helpe me god the grete,                         1230
  I never dide a thing with more peyne
  Than wryte this, to which ye me constreyne;'

  177. And took it him: he thonked hir and seyde,
  'God woot, of thing ful ofte looth bigonne
  Cometh ende good; and nece myn, Criseyde,                            1235
  That ye to him of hard now ben y-wonne
  Oughte he be glad, by god and yonder sonne!
  For-why men seyth, "impressiounes lighte
  Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte."

  178. But ye han pleyed tyraunt neigh to longe,                       1240
  And hard was it your herte for to grave;
  Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge,
  Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save.
  But hasteth yow to doon him Ioye have;
  For trusteth wel, to longe y-doon hardnesse                          1245
  Causeth despyt ful often, for distresse.'

  179. And right as they declamed this matere,
  Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
  Com ryding with his tenthe some y-fere,
  Al softely, and thiderward gan bende                                 1250
  Ther-as they sete, as was his wey to wende
  To paleys-ward; and Pandare him aspyde,
  And seyde, 'nece, y-see who cometh here ryde!

  180. O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;
  Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.'                             1255
  'Nay, nay,' quod she, and wex as reed as rose.
  With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe,
  With dreedful chere, and ofte his hewes muwe;
  And up his look debonairly he caste,
  And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste.                           1260

  181. God woot if he sat on his hors a-right,
  Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day!
  God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight!
  What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray?
  Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say,                         1265
  To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere,
  His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,

  182. His goodly manere and his gentillesse,
  So wel, that never, sith that she was born,
  Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;                          1270
  And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn,
  To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn.
  She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke;
  God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke!

  183. Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,                         1275
  Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte,
  And seyde, 'nece, I pray yow hertely,
  Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte.
  A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte,
  With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,                      1280
  Were it wel doon?' Quod she, 'nay, by my trouthe!'

  184. 'God helpe me so,' quod he, 'ye sey me sooth.
  Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye;
  Lo, yond he rit!' Quod she, 'ye, so he dooth.'
  'Wel,' quod Pandare, 'as I have told yow thrye,                      1285
  Lat be your nyce shame and your folye,
  And spek with him in esing of his herte;
  Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.'

  185. But ther-on was to heven and to done;
  Considered al thing, it may not be;                                  1290
  And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone
  To graunten him so greet a libertee.
  'For playnly hir entente,' as seyde she,
  Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,
  And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.'                      1295

  186. But Pandarus thoughte, 'it shal not be so,
  If that I may; this nyce opinioun
  Shal not be holden fully yeres two.'
  What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?
  He moste assente on that conclusioun                                 1300
  As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,
  And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.

  187. And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,
  And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce;
  And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde,                                   1305
  That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce,
  Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.
  But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge,
  He song, as who seyth, 'lo! sumwhat I bringe.'

  188. And seyde, 'who is in his bed so sone                           1310
  Y-buried thus?' 'It am I, freend,' quod he.
  'Who, Troilus? nay helpe me so the mone,'
  Quod Pandarus, 'thou shalt aryse and see
  A charme that was sent right now to thee,
  The which can helen thee of thyn accesse,                            1315
  If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.'

  189. 'Ye, through the might of god!' quod Troilus.
  And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,
  And seyde, 'pardee, god hath holpen us;
  Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.'                       1320
  But ofte gan the herte glade and quake
  Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede,
  So as the wordes yave him hope or drede.

  190. But fynally, he took al for the beste
  That she him wroot, for sumwhat he biheld                            1325
  On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,
  Al covered she the wordes under sheld.
  Thus to the more worthy part he held,
  That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,
  His grete wo for-yede he at the leste.                               1330

  191. But as we may alday our-selven see,
  Through more wode or col, the more fyr;
  Right so encrees of hope, of what it be,
  Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr;
  Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr,                                1335
  So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
  Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente.

  192. Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
  This Troilus gan to desiren more
  Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might                   1340
  To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,
  And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore
  Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde,
  That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;

  193. And dide also his othere observaunces                           1345
  That to a lovere longeth in this cas;
  And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,
  So was he outher glad or seyde 'allas!'
  And held after his gestes ay his pas;
  And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,                               1350
  So were his dayes sory outher gladde.

  194. But to Pandare alwey was his recours,
  And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne,
  And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;
  And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne,                               1355
  Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,
  And bisily with al his herte caste
  Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;

  195. And seyde, 'lord, and freend, and brother dere,
  God woot that thy disese dooth me wo.                                1360
  But woltow stinten al this woful chere,
  And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,
  And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so,
  That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place,
  Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace.                      1365

  196. And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,
  But tho that been expert in love it seye,
  It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,
  A man to have a leyser for to preye,
  And siker place his wo for to biwreye;                               1370
  For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,
  To here and see the giltles in distresse.

  197. Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so
  That kinde wolde doon hir to biginne
  To han a maner routhe up-on my wo,                                   1375
  Seyth Daunger, "Nay, thou shalt me never winne;
  So reuleth hir hir hertes goost with-inne,
  That, though she bende, yet she stant on rote;
  What in effect is this un-to my bote?"

  198. Thenk here-ayeins, whan that the sturdy ook,                    1380
  On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones,
  Receyved hath the happy falling strook,
  The grete sweigh doth it come al at ones,
  As doon these rokkes or these milne-stones.
  For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte,                    1385
  Whan it descendeth, than don thinges lighte.

  199. And reed that boweth doun for every blast,
  Ful lightly, cesse wind, it wol aryse;
  But so nil not an ook whan it is cast;
  It nedeth me nought thee longe to forbyse.                           1390
  Men shal reioysen of a greet empryse
  Acheved wel, and stant with-outen doute,
  Al han men been the lenger ther-aboute.

  200. But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,
  A thing now which that I shal axen thee;                             1395
  Which is thy brother that thou lovest best
  As in thy verray hertes privetee?'
  'Y-wis, my brother Deiphebus,' quod he.
  'Now,' quod Pandare, 'er houres twyes twelve,
  He shal thee ese, unwist of it him-selve.                            1400

  201. Now lat me allone, and werken as I may,'
  Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho
  Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay;
  Save Troilus, no man he lovede so.
  To telle in short, with-outen wordes mo,                             1405
  Quod Pandarus, 'I pray yow that ye be
  Freend to a cause which that toucheth me.'

  202. 'Yis, pardee,' quod Deiphebus, 'wel thow wost,
  In al that ever I may, and god to-fore,
  Al nere it but for man I love most,                                  1410
  My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
  It is; for sith that day that I was bore,
  I nas, ne never-mo to been I thinke,
  Ayeins a thing that mighte thee for-thinke.'

  203. Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde,                       1415
  'Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
  That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
  Which som men wolden doon oppressioun,
  And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
  Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche                               1420
  To been our freend, with-oute more speche.'

  204. Deiphebus him answerde, 'O, is not this,
  That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,
  Crisëyda, my freend?' He seyde, 'Yis.'
  'Than nedeth,' quod Deiphebus hardely,                               1425
  'Na-more to speke, for trusteth wel, that I
  Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde;
  I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde.

  205. But tel me, thou that woost al this matere,
  How I might best avaylen? now lat see.'                              1430
  Quod Pandarus, 'if ye, my lord so dere,
  Wolden as now don this honour to me,
  To prayen hir to-morwe, lo, that she
  Com un-to yow hir pleyntes to devyse,
  Hir adversaries wolde of hit agryse.                                 1435

  206. And if I more dorste preye as now,
  And chargen yow to have so greet travayle,
  To han som of your bretheren here with yow,
  That mighten to hir cause bet avayle,
  Than, woot I wel, she mighte never fayle                             1440
  For to be holpen, what at your instaunce,
  What with hir othere freendes governaunce.'

  207. Deiphebus, which that comen was, of kinde,
  To al honour and bountee to consente,
  Answerde, 'it shal be doon; and I can finde                          1445
  Yet gretter help to this in myn entente.
  What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleyne sente
  To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste;
  For she may leden Paris as hir leste.

  208. Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,                    1450
  It nedeth nought to preye him freend to be;
  For I have herd him, o tyme and eek other,
  Speke of Criseyde swich honour, that he
  May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she.
  It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;                            1455
  He shal be swich, right as we wole him have.

  209. Spek thou thy-self also to Troilus
  On my bihalve, and pray him with us dyne.'
  'Sire, al this shal be doon,' quod Pandarus;
  And took his leve, and never gan to fyne,                            1460
  But to his neces hous, as streyt as lyne,
  He com; and fond hir fro the mete aryse;
  And sette him doun, and spak right in this wyse.

  210. He seyde, 'O veray god, so have I ronne!
  Lo, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete?                             1465
  I noot whether ye the more thank me conne.
  Be ye nought war how that fals Poliphete
  Is now aboute eft-sones for to plete,
  And bringe on yow advocacyës newe?'
  'I? no,' quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe.                         1470

  211. 'What is he more aboute, me to drecche
  And doon me wrong? what shal I do, allas?
  Yet of him-self no-thing ne wolde I recche,
  Nere it for Antenor and Eneas,
  That been his freendes in swich maner cas;                           1475
  But, for the love of god, myn uncle dere,
  No fors of that, lat him have al y-fere;

  212. With-outen that, I have ynough for us.'
  'Nay,' quod Pandare, 'it shal no-thing be so.
  For I have been right now at Deiphebus,                              1480
  And Ector, and myne othere lordes mo,
  And shortly maked eche of hem his fo;
  That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne
  For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.'

  213. And as they casten what was best to done,                       1485
  Deiphebus, of his owene curtasye,
  Com hir to preye, in his propre persone,
  To holde him on the morwe companye
  At diner, which she nolde not denye,
  But goodly gan to his preyere obeye.                                 1490
  He thonked hir, and wente up-on his weye.

  214. Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up a-noon,
  To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende
  To Troilus, as stille as any stoon,
  And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;                       1495
  And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;
  And seyde him, 'now is tyme, if that thou conne,
  To bere thee wel to-morwe, and al is wonne.

  215. Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleyne;
  Lat not for nyce shame, or drede, or slouthe;                        1500
  Som-tyme a man mot telle his owene peyne;
  Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;
  Thou shalt be saved by thy feyth, in trouthe.
  But wel wot I, thou art now in a drede;
  And what it is, I leye, I can arede.                                 1505

  216. Thow thinkest now, "how sholde I doon al this?
  For by my cheres mosten folk aspye,
  That for hir love is that I fare a-mis;
  Yet hadde I lever unwist for sorwe dye."
  Now thenk not so, for thou dost greet folye.                         1510
  For right now have I founden o manere
  Of sleighte, for to coveren al thy chere.

  217. Thow shall gon over night, and that as blyve,
  Un-to Deiphebus hous, as thee to pleye,
  Thy maladye a-wey the bet to dryve,                                  1515
  For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye.
  Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,
  And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
  And lye right there, and byde thyn aventure.

  218. Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take                     1520
  The same tyme, and lasten til a-morwe;
  And lat see now how wel thou canst it make,
  For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe.
  Go now, farewel! and, Venus here to borwe,
  I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,                            1525
  Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.'

  219. Quod Troilus, 'y-wis, thou nedelees
  Counseylest me, that sykliche I me feyne!
  For I am syk in ernest, doutelees,
  So that wel neigh I sterve for the peyne.'                           1530
  Quod Pandarus, 'thou shalt the bettre pleyne,
  And hast the lasse nede to countrefete;
  For him men demen hoot that men seen swete.

  220. Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I
  Shal wel the deer un-to thy bowe dryve.'                             1535
  Therwith he took his leve al softely,
  And Troilus to paleys wente blyve.
  So glad ne was he never in al his lyve;
  And to Pandarus reed gan al assente,
  And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente.                             1540

  221. What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere
  That Deiphebus un-to his brother made,
  Or his accesse, or his syklych manere,
  How men gan him with clothes for to lade,
  Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade?                       1545
  But al for nought, he held forth ay the wyse
  That ye han herd Pandare er this devyse.

  222. But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde,
  Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,
  To been a freend and helping to Criseyde.                            1550
  God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right,
  To been hir fulle freend with al his might.
  But swich a nede was to preye him thenne,
  As for to bidde a wood man for to renne.

  223. The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme                        1555
  Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne
  Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme,
  With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;
  But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne,
  She com to diner in hir playn entente.                               1560
  But god and Pandare wiste al what this mente.

  224. Come eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,
  Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
  But flee we now prolixitee best is,
  For love of god, and lat us faste go                                 1565
  Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo,
  Why al this folk assembled in this place;
  And lat us of hir saluinges pace.

  225. Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,
  And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke.                          1570
  But ever-more, 'allas!' was his refreyn,
  'My goode brother Troilus, the syke,
  Lyth yet'--and therwith-al he gan to syke;
  And after that, he peyned him to glade
  Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.                            1575

  226. Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse
  So feithfully, that pitee was to here,
  And every wight gan waxen for accesse
  A leche anoon, and seyde, 'in this manere
  Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.'                         1580
  But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,
  That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche.

  227. After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse,
  As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
  To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse                          1585
  A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne:--
  'He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.'
  And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,
  He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme.

  228. Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,                       1590
  And every word gan for to notifye;
  For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;
  For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,
  To mowen swich a knight don live or dye?
  But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;                             1595
  For for o fyn is al that ever I telle.

  229. The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse,
  And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,
  And gonne a while of this and that devyse.
  But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,                              1600
  And seyde to Deiphebus, 'wole ye goon,
  If yourë wille be, as I yow preyde,
  To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?'

  230. Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,
  Took first the tale, and seyde, 'go we blyve;'                       1605
  And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,
  And seyde, 'Ioves lat him never thryve,
  That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve!
  And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,
  If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.'                              1610

  231. 'Tel thou thy neces cas,' quod Deiphebus
  To Pandarus, 'for thou canst best it telle.'--
  'My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus;
  What sholde I lenger,' quod he, 'do yow dwelle?'
  He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle,                                1615
  Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete,
  So hëynous, that men mighte on it spete.

  232. Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,
  And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,
  'An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;                         1620
  And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.'
  What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien?
  Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten,
  To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten.

  233. Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, 'Pandarus,                         1625
  Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere,
  I mene, Ector? or woot it Troilus?'
  He seyde, 'ye, but wole ye now me here?
  Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,
  It were good, if that ye wolde assente,                              1630
  She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente.

  234. For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,
  By cause, lo, that she a lady is;
  And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,
  And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,                              1635
  If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.'
  And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,
  'God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!'

  235. To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,
  And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,                                   1640
  Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,
  And seyde hem, 'so there be no taryinge,
  Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe
  Crisëyda, my lady, that is here;
  And as he may enduren, he wole here.                                 1645

  236. But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,
  And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;
  Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,
  To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm
  Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),                                  1650
  Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones;
  Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.

  237. I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe,
  That no wight in ne wente but ye tweye,
  But it were I, for I can, in a throwe,                               1655
  Reherce hir cas, unlyk that she can seye;
  And after this, she may him ones preye
  To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
  This may not muchel of his ese him reve.

  238. And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere                    1660
  His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;
  Eek other thing, that toucheth not to here,
  He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,
  That secret is, and for the tounes prow.'
  And they, that no-thing knewe of this entente,                       1665
  With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente.

  239. Eleyne in al hir goodly softe wyse,
  Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,
  And seyde, 'ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse!
  Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!'                           1670
  And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye,
  And him with al hir wit to recomforte;
  As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.

  240. So after this quod she, 'we yow biseke,
  My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I,                                   1675
  For love of god, and so doth Pandare eke,
  To been good lord and freend, right hertely,
  Un-to Criseyde, which that certeinly
  Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,
  That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.'                            1680

  241. This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle,
  And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;
  Whan it was seyd, sone after, in a whyle,
  Quod Troilus, 'as sone as I may goon,
  I wol right fayn with al my might ben oon,                           1685
  Have god my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.'
  'Good thrift have ye,' quod Eleyne the quene.

  242. Quod Pandarus, 'and it your wille be,
  That she may take hir leve, er that she go?'
  'Or elles god for-bede,' tho quod he,                                1690
  'If that she vouche sauf for to do so.'
  And with that word quod Troilus, 'ye two,
  Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere,
  To yow have I to speke of o matere,

  243. To been avysed by your reed the bettre':--                      1695
  And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed,
  The copie of a tretis and a lettre,
  That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed,
  If swich a man was worthy to ben deed,
  Woot I nought who; but in a grisly wyse                              1700
  He preyede hem anoon on it avyse.

  244. Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde
  In ernest greet; so dide Eleyne the quene;
  And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,
  Downward a steyre, in-to an herber grene.                            1705
  This ilke thing they redden hem bi-twene;
  And largely, the mountaunce of an houre,
  They gonne on it to reden and to poure.

  245. Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon
  To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye                                 1710
  That al was wel, and out he gan to goon
  In-to the grete chambre, and that in hye,
  And seyde, 'god save al this companye!
  Com, nece myn; my lady quene Eleyne
  Abydeth yow, and eek my lordes tweyne.                               1715

  246. Rys, take with yow your nece Antigone,
  Or whom yow list, or no fors, hardily;
  The lasse prees, the bet; com forth with me,
  And loke that ye thonke humblely
  Hem alle three, and, whan ye may goodly                              1720
  Your tyme y-see, taketh of hem your leve,
  Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.'

  247. Al innocent of Pandarus entente,
  Quod tho Criseyde, 'go we, uncle dere';
  And arm in arm inward with him she wente,                            1725
  Avysed wel hir wordes and hir chere;
  And Pandarus, in ernestful manere,
  Seyde, 'alle folk, for goddes love, I preye,
  Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleye.

  248. Aviseth yow what folk ben here with-inne,                       1730
  And in what plyt oon is, god him amende!
  And inward thus ful softely biginne;
  Nece, I coniure and heighly yow defende,
  On his half, which that sowle us alle sende,
  And in the vertue of corounes tweyne,                                1735
  Slee nought this man, that hath for yow this peyne!

  249. Fy on the devel! thenk which oon he is,
  And in what plyt he lyth; com of anoon;
  Thenk al swich taried tyd, but lost it nis!
  That wol ye bothe seyn, whan ye ben oon.                             1740
  Secoundelich, ther yet devyneth noon
  Up-on yow two; com of now, if ye conne;
  Whyl folk is blent, lo, al the tyme is wonne!

  250. In titering, and pursuite, and delayes,
  The folk devyne at wagginge of a stree;                              1745
  And though ye wolde han after merye dayes,
  Than dar ye nought, and why? for she, and she
  Spak swich a word; thus loked he, and he;
  Lest tyme I loste, I dar not with yow dele;
  Com of therfore, and bringeth him to hele.'                          1750

  251. But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here,
  Was Troilus nought in a cankedort,
  That lay, and mighte whispringe of hem here,
  And thoughte, 'O lord, right now renneth my sort
  Fully to dye, or han anoon comfort';                                 1755
  And was the firste tyme he shulde hir preye
  Of love; O mighty god, what shal he seye?

  O sonnes leef, O Ioves doughter dere,
  Plesaunce of love, O goodly debonaire,
  In gentil hertes ay redy to repaire!                                    5

  Thee fele in tymes with vapour eterne.
  God loveth, and to love wol nought werne;
  And in this world no lyves creature,
  With-outen love, is worth, or may endure.

  3. Ye Ioves first to thilke effectes glade,                            15

  And in a thousand formes doun him sente                                20

  Of thinges which that folk on wondren so,

  To which gladnes, who nede hath, god him bringe!

  8. Lay al this mene whyle Troilus,                                     50
  Recordinge his lessoun in this manere,
  'Ma fey!' thought he, 'thus wole I seye and thus;
  Thus wole I pleyne un-to my lady dere;
  That word is good, and this shal be my chere;
  This nil I not foryeten in no wyse.'                                   55
  God leve him werken as he gan devyse.

  9. And lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,
  Heringe hir come, and shorte for to syke!
  And Pandarus, that ladde hir by the lappe,
  Com ner, and gan in at the curtin pyke,                                60
  And seyde, 'god do bote on alle syke!
  See, who is here yow comen to visyte;
  Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.'

  10. Ther-with it semed as he wepte almost;
  'A ha,' quod Troilus so rewfully,                                      65
  'Wher me be wo, O mighty god, thou wost!
  Who is al there? I see nought trewely.'
  'Sire,' quod Criseyde, 'it is Pandare and I.'
  'Ye, swete herte? allas, I may nought ryse
  To knele, and do yow honour in som wyse.'                              70

  11. And dressede him upward, and she right tho
  Gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye,
  'O, for the love of god, do ye not so
  To me,' quod she, 'ey! what is this to seye?
  Sire, come am I to yow for causes tweye;                               75
  First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke
  Continuaunce I wolde yow biseke.'

  12. This Troilus, that herde his lady preye
  Of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed,
  Ne mighte a word for shame to it seye,                                 80
  Al-though men sholde smyten of his heed.
  But lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed,
  And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne,
  To preyen hir, is thurgh his wit y-ronne.

  13. Cryseyde al this aspyede wel y-nough,                              85
  For she was wys, and lovede him never-the-lasse,
  Al nere he malapert, or made it tough,
  Or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse.
  But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,
  His resons, as I may my rymes holde,                                   90
  I yow wol telle, as techen bokes olde.

  14. In chaunged vois, right for his verrey drede,
  Which vois eek quook, and ther-to his manere
  Goodly abayst, and now his hewes rede,
  Now pale, un-to Criseyde, his lady dere,                               95
  With look doun cast and humble yolden chere,
  Lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte
  Was, twyes, 'mercy, mercy, swete herte!'

  15. And stinte a whyl, and whan he mighte out-bringe,
  The nexte word was, 'god wot, for I have,                             100
  As feythfully as I have had konninge,
  Ben youres, also god my sowle save;
  And shal, til that I, woful wight, be grave.
  And though I dar ne can un-to yow pleyne,
  Y-wis, I suffre nought the lasse peyne.                               105

  16. Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wyf,
  I may out-bringe, and if this yow displese,
  That shal I wreke upon myn owne lyf
  Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese,
  If with my deeth your herte I may apese.                              110
  But sin that ye han herd me som-what seye,
  Now recche I never how sone that I deye.'

  17. Ther-with his manly sorwe to biholde,
  It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe;
  And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde,                                115
  And poked ever his nece newe and newe,
  And seyde, 'wo bigon ben hertes trewe!
  For love of god, make of this thing an ende,
  Or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.'

  18. 'I? what?' quod she, 'by god and by my trouthe,                   120
  I noot nought what ye wilne that I seye.'
  'I? what?' quod he, 'that ye han on him routhe,
  For goddes love, and doth him nought to deye.'
  'Now thanne thus,' quod she, 'I wolde him preye
  To telle me the fyn of his entente;                                   125
  Yet wiste I never wel what that he mente.'

  19. 'What that I mene, O swete herte dere?'
  Quod Troilus, 'O goodly fresshe free!
  That, with the stremes of your eyen clere,
  Ye wolde som-tyme freendly on me see,                                 130
  And thanne agreën that I may ben he,
  With-oute braunche of vyce in any wyse,
  In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servyse

  20. As to my lady right and chief resort,
  With al my wit and al my diligence,                                   135
  And I to han, right as yow list, comfort,
  Under your yerde, egal to myn offence,
  As deeth, if that I breke your defence;
  And that ye deigne me so muche honoure,
  Me to comaunden ought in any houre.                                   140

  21. And I to ben your verray humble trewe,
  Secret, and in my paynes pacient,
  And ever-mo desire freshly newe,
  To serven, and been y-lyke ay diligent,
  And, with good herte, al holly your talent                            145
  Receyven wel, how sore that me smerte,
  Lo, this mene I, myn owene swete herte.'

  22. Quod Pandarus, 'lo, here an hard request,
  And resonable, a lady for to werne!
  Now, nece myn, by natal Ioves fest,                                   150
  Were I a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne,
  That heren wel, this man wol no-thing yerne
  But your honour, and seen him almost sterve,
  And been so looth to suffren him yow serve.'

  23. With that she gan hir eyen on him caste                           155
  Ful esily, and ful debonairly,
  Avysing hir, and hyed not to faste
  With never a word, but seyde him softely,
  'Myn honour sauf, I wol wel trewely,
  And in swich forme as he can now devyse,                              160
  Receyven him fully to my servyse,

  24. Biseching him, for goddes love, that he
  Wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse,
  As I wel mene, eek mene wel to me,
  And myn honour, with wit and besinesse,                               165
  Ay kepe; and if I may don him gladnesse,
  From hennes-forth, y-wis, I nil not feyne:
  Now beeth al hool, no lenger ye ne pleyne.

  25. But nathelees, this warne I yow,' quod she,
  'A kinges sone al-though ye be, y-wis,                                170
  Ye shul na-more have soverainetee
  Of me in love, than right in that cas is;
  Ne I nil forbere, if that ye doon a-mis,
  To wrathen yow; and whyl that ye me serve,
  Cherycen yow right after ye deserve.                                  175

  26. And shortly, derë herte and al my knight,
  Beth glad, and draweth yow to lustinesse,
  And I shal trewely, with al my might,
  Your bittre tornen al in-to swetnesse;
  If I be she that may yow do gladnesse,                                180
  For every wo ye shal recovere a blisse';
  And him in armes took, and gan him kisse.

  27. Fil Pandarus on knees, and up his yën
  To hevene threw, and held his hondes hye,
  'Immortal god!' quod he, 'that mayst nought dyen,                     185
  Cupide I mene, of this mayst glorifye;
  And Venus, thou mayst make melodye;
  With-outen hond, me semeth that in towne,
  For this merveyle, I here ech belle sowne.

  28. But ho! no more as now of this matere,                            190
  For-why this folk wol comen up anoon,
  That han the lettre red; lo, I hem here.
  But I coniure thee, Criseyde, and oon,
  And two, thou Troilus, whan thow mayst goon,
  That at myn hous ye been at my warninge,                              195
  For I ful wel shal shape your cominge;

  29. And eseth ther your hertes right y-nough;
  And lat see which of yow shal bere the belle
  To speke of love a-right!' ther-with he lough,
  'For ther have ye a layser for to telle.'                             200
  Quod Troilus, 'how longe shal I dwelle
  Er this be doon?' Quod he, 'whan thou mayst ryse,
  This thing shal be right as I yow devyse.'

  30. With that Eleyne and also Deiphebus
  Tho comen upward, right at the steyres ende;                          205
  And lord, so than gan grone Troilus,
  His brother and his suster for to blende.
  Quod Pandarus, 'it tyme is that we wende;
  Tak, nece myn, your leve at alle three,
  And lat hem speke, and cometh forth with me.'                         210

  31. She took hir leve at hem ful thriftily,
  As she wel coude, and they hir reverence
  Un-to the fulle diden hardely,
  And speken wonder wel, in hir absence,
  Of hir, in preysing of hir excellence,                                215
  Hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere
  Commendeden, it Ioye was to here.

  32. Now lat hir wende un-to hir owne place,
  And torne we to Troilus a-yein,
  That gan ful lightly of the lettre passe,                             220
  That Deiphebus hadde in the gardin seyn.
  And of Eleyne and him he wolde fayn
  Delivered been, and seyde, that him leste
  To slepe, and after tales have reste.

  33. Eleyne him kiste, and took hir leve blyve,                        225
  Deiphebus eek, and hoom wente every wight;
  And Pandarus, as faste as he may dryve,
  To Troilus tho com, as lyne right;
  And on a paillet, al that glade night,
  By Troilus he lay, with mery chere,                                   230
  To tale; and wel was hem they were y-fere.

  34. Whan every wight was voided but they two,
  And alle the dores were faste y-shette,
  To telle in short, with-oute wordes mo,
  This Pandarus, with-outen any lette,                                  235
  Up roos, and on his beddes syde him sette,
  And gan to speken in a sobre wyse
  To Troilus, as I shal yow devyse.

  35. 'Myn alderlevest lord, and brother dere,
  God woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore,                           240
  When I thee saw so languisshing to-yere,
  For love, of which thy wo wex alwey more;
  That I, with al my might and al my lore,
  Have ever sithen doon my bisinesse
  To bringe thee to Ioye out of distresse;                              245

  36. And have it brought to swich plyt as thou wost,
  So that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye
  To fare wel, I seye it for no bost,
  And wostow why? for shame it is to seye,
  For thee have I bigonne a gamen pleye                                 250
  Which that I never doon shal eft for other,
  Al-though he were a thousand fold my brother.

  37. That is to seye, for thee am I bicomen,
  Bitwixen game and ernest, swich a mene
  As maken wommen un-to men to comen;                                   255
  Al sey I nought, thou wost wel what I mene.
  For thee have I my nece, of vyces clene,
  So fully maad thy gentilesse triste,
  That al shal been right as thy-selve liste.

  38. But god, that al wot, take I to witnesse,                         260
  That never I this for coveityse wroughte,
  But only for to abregge that distresse,
  For which wel nygh thou deydest, as me thoughte.
  But gode brother, do now as thee oughte,
  For goddes love, and keep hir out of blame,                           265
  Sin thou art wys, and save alwey hir name.

  39. For wel thou wost, the name as yet of here
  Among the peple, as who seyth, halwed is;
  For that man is unbore, I dar wel swere,
  That ever wiste that she dide amis.                                   270
  But wo is me, that I, that cause al this,
  May thenken that she is my nece dere,
  And I hir eem, and traytor eek y-fere!

  40. And were it wist that I, through myn engyn,
  Hadde in my nece y-put this fantasye,                                 275
  To do thy lust, and hoolly to be thyn,
  Why, al the world up-on it wolde crye,
  And seye, that I the worste trecherye
  Dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne,
  And she for-lost, and thou right nought y-wonne.                      280

  41. Wher-fore, er I wol ferther goon a pas,
  Yet eft I thee biseche and fully seye,
  That privetee go with us in this cas,
  That is to seye, that thou us never wreye;
  And be nought wrooth, though I thee ofte preye                        285
  To holden secree swich an heigh matere;
  For skilful is, thow wost wel, my preyere.

  42. And thenk what wo ther hath bitid er this,
  For makinge of avauntes, as men rede;
  And what mischaunce in this world yet ther is,                        290
  Fro day to day, right for that wikked dede;
  For which these wyse clerkes that ben dede
  Han ever yet proverbed to us yonge,
  That "firste vertu is to kepe tonge."

  43. And, nere it that I wilne as now tabregge                         295
  Diffusioun of speche, I coude almost
  A thousand olde stories thee alegge
  Of wommen lost, thorugh fals and foles bost;
  Proverbes canst thy-self y-nowe, and wost,
  Ayeins that vyce, for to been a labbe,                                300
  Al seyde men sooth as often as they gabbe.

  44. O tonge, allas! so often here-biforn
  Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe
  Seyd, "welawey! the day that I was born!"
  And many a maydes sorwes for to newe;                                 305
  And, for the more part, al is untrewe
  That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve;
  Of kinde non avauntour is to leve.

  45. Avauntour and a lyere, al is on;
  As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me                                  310
  Hir love, and seyth that other wol she non,
  And I am sworn to holden it secree,
  And after I go telle it two or three;
  Y-wis, I am avauntour at the leste,
  And lyere, for I breke my biheste.                                    315

  46. Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame,
  Swich maner folk; what shal I clepe hem, what,
  That hem avaunte of wommen, and by name,
  That never yet bihighte hem this ne that,
  Ne knewe hem more than myn olde hat?                                  320
  No wonder is, so god me sende hele,
  Though wommen drede with us men to dele.

  47. I sey not this for no mistrust of yow,
  Ne for no wys man, but for foles nyce,
  And for the harm that in the world is now,                            325
  As wel for foly ofte as for malyce;
  For wel wot I, in wyse folk, that vyce
  No womman drat, if she be wel avysed;
  For wyse ben by foles harm chastysed.

  48. But now to purpos; leve brother dere,                             330
  Have al this thing that I have seyd in minde,
  And keep thee clos, and be now of good chere,
  For at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde.
  I shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde,
  And god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse,                          335
  For it shal been right as thou wolt devyse.

  49. For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde;
  Therfore I dar this fully undertake.
  Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee,
  And day is set, the chartres up to make.                              340
  Have now good night, I may no lenger wake;
  And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse,
  That god me sende deeth or sone lisse.'

  50. Who mighte telle half the Ioye or feste
  Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte,                            345
  Heringe theffect of Pandarus biheste?
  His olde wo, that made his herte swelte,
  Gan tho for Ioye wasten and to-melte,
  And al the richesse of his sykes sore
  At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more.                              350

  51. But right so as these holtes and these hayes,
  That han in winter dede been and dreye,
  Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is,
  Whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye:
  Right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye,                              355
  Wex sodeynliche his herte ful of Ioye,
  That gladder was ther never man in Troye.

  52. And gan his look on Pandarus up caste
  Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see,
  And seyde, 'freend, in Aprille the laste,                             360
  As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee,
  How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me;
  And how thou didest al thy bisinesse
  To knowe of me the cause of my distresse.

  53. Thou wost how longe I it for-bar to seye                          365
  To thee, that art the man that I best triste;
  And peril was it noon to thee by-wreye,
  That wiste I wel; but tel me, if thee liste,
  Sith I so looth was that thy-self it wiste,
  How dorste I mo tellen of this matere,                                370
  That quake now, and no wight may us here?

  54. But natheles, by that god I thee swere,
  That, as him list, may al this world governe,
  And, if I lye, Achilles with his spere
  Myn herte cleve, al were my lyf eterne,                               375
  As I am mortal, if I late or yerne
  Wolde it biwreye, or dorste, or sholde conne,
  For al the good that god made under sonne;

  55. That rather deye I wolde, and determyne,
  As thinketh me, now stokked in presoun,                               380
  In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermyne,
  Caytif to cruel king Agamenoun;
  And this, in alle the temples of this toun,
  Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,
  To-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here.                               385

  56. And that thou hast so muche y-doon for me,
  That I ne may it never-more deserve,
  This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee
  A thousand tymes on a morwen sterve,
  I can no more, but that I wol thee serve                              390
  Right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende,
  For ever-more, un-to my lyves ende!

  57. But here, with al myn herte, I thee biseche,
  That never in me thou deme swich folye
  As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche,                           395
  That this, which thou me dost for companye,
  I sholde wene it were a bauderye;
  I am nought wood, al-if I lewed be;
  It is not so, that wool I wel, pardee.

  58. But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,                       400
  On swich message, calle him what thee list;
  And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,
  Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;
  Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist
  How that there is dyversitee requered                                 405
  Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered.

  59. And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene
  That this servyse a shame be or Iape,
  I have my faire suster Polixene,
  Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape;                               410
  Be she never so faire or wel y-shape,
  Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,
  To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone.

  60. But sin that thou hast don me this servyse,
  My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede,                            415
  So, for the love of god, this grete empryse
  Parforme it out; for now is moste nede.
  For high and low, with-outen any drede,
  I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe;
  Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.'                         420

  61. Thus held him ech with other wel apayed,
  That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;
  And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed,
  Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.
  But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende                              425
  For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce,
  He not for-gat his gode governaunce.

  62. But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne
  Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere,
  That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,                             430
  Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,
  What that he mente, as touching this matere.
  From every wight as fer as is the cloude
  He was, so wel dissimulen he coude.

  63. And al the whyl which that I yow devyse,                          435
  This was his lyf; with al his fulle might,
  By day he was in Martes high servyse,
  This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
  And for the more part, the longe night
  He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve                         440
  His lady best, hir thank for to deserve.

  64. Nil I nought swerë, al-though he lay softe,
  That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,
  Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,
  And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;                           445
  But in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed,
  For ought I wot, no more than was he;
  That can I deme of possibilitee.

  65. But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,
  That in this whyle, as writen is in geste,                            450
  He say his lady som-tyme; and also
  She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,
  And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste,
  Apoynteden ful warly in this nede,
  So as they dorste, how they wolde procede.                            455

  66. But it was spoken in so short a wyse,
  In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere,
  Lest any wyght divynen or devyse
  Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,
  That al this world so leef to hem ne were                             460
  As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende
  To maken of hir speche aright an ende.

  67. But thilke litel that they speke or wroughte,
  His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede,
  It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte                              465
  With-outen word, so that it was no nede
  To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede;
  For which she thoughte that love, al come it late,
  Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate.

  68. And shortly of this proces for to pace,                           470
  So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,
  That he so ful stood in his lady grace,
  That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette,
  She thonked god she ever with him mette;
  So coude he him governe in swich servyse,                             475
  That al the world ne mighte it bet devyse.

  69. For-why she fond him so discreet in al,
  So secret, and of swich obëisaunce,
  That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
  Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;                          480
  That, to ben in his gode governaunce,
  So wys he was, she was no more afered,
  I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.

  70. And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr,
  Was ever y-lyke prest and diligent;                                   485
  To ese his frend was set al his desyr.
  He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;
  He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent.
  That never man, as in his freendes nede,
  Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede.                             490

  71. But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde
  That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere
  Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,
  In al this whyle, un-to his lady dere;
  I trowe it were a long thing for to here;                             495
  Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte,
  His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte.

  72. For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,
  In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene;
  And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis;                                500
  For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,
  That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene
  Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte;
  How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte?

  73. But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,                         505
  That stonding in concord and in quiete
  Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,
  As I have told, and in this tyme swete,
  Save only often mighte they not mete,
  Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle,                               510
  That it befel right as I shal yow telle,

  74. That Pandarus, that ever dide his might
  Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,
  As for to bringe to his hous som night
  His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere,                                   515
  Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere,
  Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde,
  Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde.

  75. For he with greet deliberacioun
  Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle                           520
  Forn-cast, and put in execucioun,
  And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle;
  Come if hem lest, hem sholde no-thing fayle;
  And for to been in ought espyed there,
  That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were.                               525

  76. Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind
  Of every pye and every lette-game;
  Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
  In this matere, bothe fremed and tame.
  This timber is al redy up to frame;                                   530
  Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde
  A certein houre, in whiche she comen sholde.

  77. And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce
  Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay,
  Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce,                            535
  And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray,
  If that he were missed, night or day,
  Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse,
  That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse,

  78. And moste at swich a temple alone wake,                           540
  Answered of Appollo for to be;
  And first, to seen the holy laurer quake,
  Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
  To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
  And forthy lette him no man, god forbede,                             545
  But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.

  79. Now is ther litel more for to done,
  But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,
  Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,
  Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne,                         550
  And that the welken shoop him for to reyne,
  He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente;
  Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente.

  80. Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
  As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape;                              555
  And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye,
  By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
  Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape;
  But certeynly she moste, by hir leve,
  Come soupen in his hous with him at eve.                              560

  81. At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse,
  And seyde, 'it rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?'
  'Lat be,' quod he, 'ne stond not thus to muse;
  This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.'
  So at the laste her-of they felle at oon,                             565
  Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,
  He nolde never come ther she were.

  82. Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne,
  And asked him if Troilus were there?
  He swor hir, 'nay, for he was out of towne,'                          570
  And seyde, 'nece, I pose that he were,
  Yow thurfte never have the more fere.
  For rather than men mighte him ther aspye,
  Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.'

  83. Nought list myn auctor fully to declare                           575
  What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,
  That Troilus was out of town y-fare,
  As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no;
  But that, with-oute awayt, with him to go,
  She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte,                         580
  And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.

  84. But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
  Al-though with him to goon it was no fere,
  For to be war of goosish peples speche,
  That dremen thinges whiche that never were,                           585
  And wel avyse him whom he broughte there;
  And seyde him, 'eem, sin I mot on yow triste,
  Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.'

  85. He swor hir, 'yis, by stokkes and by stones,
  And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle,                              590
  Or elles were him lever, soule and bones,
  With Pluto king as depe been in helle
  As Tantalus!' What sholde I more telle?
  Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
  And she to souper com, whan it was eve,                               595

  86. With a certayn of hir owene men,
  And with hir faire nece Antigone,
  And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten;
  But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,
  But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see                             600
  Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe,
  Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,

  87. Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?
  But to the poynt; now whan she was y-come
  With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare,                                605
  Hir eem anoon in armes hath hir nome,
  And after to the souper, alle and some,
  Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette;
  God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette.

  88. And after souper gonnen they to ryse,                             610
  At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,
  And wel was him that coude best devyse
  To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made.
  He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade.
  But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,                           615
  She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende.

  89. But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,
  O influences of thise hevenes hye!
  Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes,
  Though to us bestes been the causes wrye.                             620
  This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye,
  But execut was al bisyde hir leve,
  At the goddes wil; for which she moste bleve.

  90. The bente mone with hir hornes pale,
  Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were,                             625
  That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale,
  That every maner womman that was there
  Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere;
  At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne,
  'Now were it tyme a lady to go henne!                                 630

  91. But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
  Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,' quod he,
  'To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese
  As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
  For-why this is your owene hous, pardee.                              635
  For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,
  To wende as now, it were to me a shame.'

  92. Criseyde, whiche that coude as muche good
  As half a world, tok hede of his preyere;
  And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,                                640
  She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here,
  And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
  And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde;
  For hoom to goon it may nought wel bityde.

  93. 'I wol,' quod she, 'myn uncle leef and dere,                      645
  Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so;
  I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
  I seyde but a-game, I wolde go.'
  'Y-wis, graunt mercy, nece!' quod he tho;
  'Were it a game or no, soth for to telle,                             650
  Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.'

  94. Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright
  The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn;
  But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,
  He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn,                                  655
  And seyde, 'lord, this is an huge rayn!
  This were a weder for to slepen inne;
  And that I rede us sone to biginne.

  95. And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,
  For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,                              660
  And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,
  Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre?
  By god, right in my lyte closet yonder.
  And I wol in that outer hous allone
  Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone.                                 665

  96. And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
  Shul youre wommen slepen wel and softe;
  And ther I seyde shal your-selve be;
  And if ye liggen wel to-night, com ofte,
  And careth not what weder is on-lofte.                                670
  The wyn anon, and whan so that yow leste,
  So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.'

  97. Ther nis no more, but here-after sone,
  The voydè dronke, and travers drawe anon,
  Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done                            675
  More in that place, out of the chaumber gon.
  And ever-mo so sternelich it ron,
  And blew ther-with so wonderliche loude,
  That wel neigh no man heren other coude.

  98. Tho Pandarus, hir eem, right as him oughte,                       680
  With women swiche as were hir most aboute,
  Ful glad un-to hir beddes syde hir broughte,
  And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,
  And seyde, 'here at this closet-dore with-oute,
  Right over-thwart, your wommen liggen alle,                           685
  That, whom yow liste of hem, ye may here calle.'

  99. So whan that she was in the closet leyd,
  And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce
  A-bedde weren, ther as I have seyd,
  There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,                          690
  But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce,
  If any wight was steringe any-where,
  And late hem slepe that a-bedde were.

  100. But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del
  The olde daunce, and every poynt ther-inne,                           695
  Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,
  He thoughte he wolde up-on his werk biginne,
  And gan the stewe-dore al softe un-pinne,
  And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette,
  By Troilus a-doun right he him sette.                                 700

  101. And, shortly to the poynt right for to gon,
  Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,
  And seyde, 'make thee redy right anon,
  For thou shalt in-to hevene blisse wende.'
  'Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,'                             705
  Quod Troilus, 'for never yet no nede
  Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.'

  102. Quod Pandarus, 'ne drede thee never a del,
  For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre;
  So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel,                           710
  Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre.'
  'Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,'
  Quod Troilus, 'as wis as I thee serve,
  And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve.

  103. And if I hadde, O Venus ful of murthe,                           715
  Aspectes badde of Mars or of Saturne,
  Or thou combust or let were in my birthe,
  Thy fader prey al thilke harm disturne
  Of grace, and that I glad ayein may turne,
  For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,                           720
  I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe.

  104. O Iove eek, for the love of faire Europe,
  The whiche in forme of bole away thou fette;
  Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope,
  For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne lette;                          725
  O Phebus, thenk whan Dane hir-selven shette
  Under the bark, and laurer wex for drede,
  Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede!

  105. Mercurie, for the love of Hiersè eke,
  For which Pallas was with Aglauros wrooth,                            730
  Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke,
  That this viage be not to thee looth.
  O fatal sustren, which, er any clooth
  Me shapen was, my destenè me sponne,
  So helpeth to this werk that is bi-gonne!'                            735

  106. Quod Pandarus, 'thou wrecched mouses herte,
  Art thou agast so that she wol thee byte?
  Why, don this furred cloke up-on thy sherte,
  And folowe me, for I wol han the wyte;
  But byd, and lat me go bifore a lyte.'                                740
  And with that word he gan un-do a trappe,
  And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.

  107. The sterne wind so loude gan to route
  That no wight other noyse mighte here;
  And they that layen at the dore with-oute,                            745
  Ful sykerly they slepten alle y-fere;
  And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere,
  Goth to the dore anon with-outen lette,
  Ther-as they laye, and softely it shette.

  108. And as he com ayeinward prively,                                 750
  His nece awook, and asked 'who goth there?'
  'My dere nece,' quod he, 'it am I;
  Ne wondreth not, ne have of it no fere;'
  And ner he com, and seyde hir in hir ere,
  'No word, for love of god I yow biseche;                              755
  Lat no wight ryse and heren of our speche.'

  109. 'What! which wey be ye comen, _benedicite_?'
  Quod she, 'and how thus unwist of hem alle?'
  'Here at this secre trappe-dore,' quod he.
  Quod tho Criseyde, 'lat me som wight calle.'                          760
  'Ey! god forbede that it sholde falle,'
  Quod Pandarus, 'that ye swich foly wroughte!
  They mighte deme thing they never er thoughte!

  110. It is nought good a sleping hound to wake,
  Ne yeve a wight a cause to devyne;                                    765
  Your wommen slepen alle, I under-take,
  So that, for hem, the hous men mighte myne;
  And slepen wolen til the sonne shyne.
  And whan my tale al brought is to an ende,
  Unwist, right as I com, so wol I wende.                               770

  111. Now nece myn, ye shul wel understonde,'
  Quod he, 'so as ye wommen demen alle,
  That for to holde in love a man in honde,
  And him hir "leef" and "dere herte" calle,
  And maken him an howve above a calle,                                 775
  I mene, as love an other in this whyle,
  She doth hir-self a shame, and him a gyle.

  112. Now wherby that I telle yow al this?
  Ye woot your-self, as wel as any wight,
  How that your love al fully graunted is                               780
  To Troilus, the worthieste knight,
  Oon of this world, and ther-to trouthe plyght,
  That, but it were on him along, ye nolde
  Him never falsen, whyl ye liven sholde.

  113. Now stant it thus, that sith I fro yow wente,                    785
  This Troilus, right platly for to seyn,
  Is thurgh a goter, by a privè wente,
  In-to my chaumbre come in al this reyn,
  Unwist of every maner wight, certeyn,
  Save of my-self, as wisly have I Ioye,                                790
  And by that feith I shal Pryam of Troye!

  114. And he is come in swich peyne and distresse
  That, but he be al fully wood by this,
  He sodeynly mot falle in-to wodnesse,
  But-if god helpe; and cause why this is,                              795
  He seyth him told is, of a freend of his,
  How that ye sholde love oon that hatte Horaste,
  For sorwe of which this night shalt been his laste.'

  115. Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde,
  Gan sodeynly aboute hir herte colde,                                  800
  And with a syk she sorwfully answerde,
  'Allas! I wende, who-so tales tolde,
  My dere herte wolde me not holde
  So lightly fals! allas! conceytes wronge,
  What harm they doon, for now live I to longe!                         805

  116. Horaste! allas! and falsen Troilus?
  I knowe him not, god helpe me so,' quod she;
  'Allas! what wikked spirit tolde him thus?
  Now certes, eem, to-morwe, and I him see,
  I shal ther-of as ful excusen me                                      810
  As ever dide womman, if him lyke';
  And with that word she gan ful sore syke.

  117. 'O god!' quod she, 'so worldly selinesse,
  Which clerkes callen fals felicitee,
  Y-medled is with many a bitternesse!                                  815
  Ful anguisshous than is, god woot,' quod she,
  'Condicioun of veyn prosperitee;
  For either Ioyes comen nought y-fere,
  Or elles no wight hath hem alwey here.

  118. O brotel wele of mannes Ioye unstable!                           820
  With what wight so thou be, or how thou pleye,
  Either he woot that thou, Ioye, art muable,
  Or woot it not, it moot ben oon of tweye;
  Now if he woot it not, how may he seye
  That he hath verray Ioye and selinesse,                               825
  That is of ignoraunce ay in derknesse?

  119. Now if he woot that Ioye is transitorie,
  As every Ioye of worldly thing mot flee,
  Than every tyme he that hath in memorie,
  The drede of lesing maketh him that he                                830
  May in no parfit selinesse be.
  And if to lese his Ioye he set a myte,
  Than semeth it that Ioye is worth ful lyte.

  120. Wherfore I wol deffyne in this matere,
  That trewely, for ought I can espye,                                  835
  Ther is no verray wele in this world here.
  But O, thou wikked serpent Ialousye,
  Thou misbeleved and envious folye,
  Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste,
  That never yet agilte him, that I wiste?'                             840

  121. Quod Pandarus, 'thus fallen is this cas.'
  'Why, uncle myn,' quod she, 'who tolde him this?
  Why doth my dere herte thus, allas?'
  'Ye woot, ye nece myn,' quod he, 'what is;
  I hope al shal be wel that is amis.                                   845
  For ye may quenche al this, if that yow leste,
  And doth right so, for I holde it the beste.'

  122. 'So shal I do to-morwe, y-wis,' quod she,
  'And god to-forn, so that it shal suffyse.'
  'To-morwe? allas, that were a fayr,' quod he,                         850
  'Nay, nay, it may not stonden in this wyse;
  For, nece myn, thus wryten clerkes wyse,
  That peril is with drecching in y-drawe;
  Nay, swich abodes been nought worth an hawe.

  123. Nece, al thing hath tyme, I dar avowe;                           855
  For whan a chaumber a-fyr is, or an halle,
  Wel more nede is, it sodeynly rescowe
  Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle
  How is this candele in the straw y-falle?
  A! _benedicite!_ for al among that fare                               860
  The harm is doon, and fare-wel feldefare!

  124. And, nece myn, ne take it not a-greef,
  If that ye suffre him al night in this wo,
  God help me so, ye hadde him never leef,
  That dar I seyn, now there is but we two;                             865
  But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so;
  Ye been to wys to do so gret folye,
  To putte his lyf al night in Iupartye.'

  125. 'Hadde I him never leef? By god, I wene
  Ye hadde never thing so leef,' quod she.                              870
  'Now by my thrift,' quod he, 'that shal be sene;
  For, sin ye make this ensample of me,
  If I al night wolde him in sorwe see
  For al the tresour in the toun of Troye,
  I bidde god, I never mote have Ioye!                                  875

  126. Now loke thanne, if ye, that been his love,
  Shul putte al night his lyf in Iupartye
  For thing of nought! Now, by that god above,
  Nought only this delay comth of folye,
  But of malyce, if that I shal nought lye.                             880
  What, platly, and ye suffre him in distresse,
  Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!'

  127. Quod tho Criseyde, 'wole ye doon o thing,
  And ye therwith shal stinte al his disese;
  Have here, and bereth him this blewe ringe,                           885
  For ther is no-thing mighte him bettre plese,
  Save I my-self, ne more his herte apese;
  And sey my dere herte, that his sorwe
  Is causeles, that shal be seen to-morwe.'

  128. 'A ring?' quod he, 'ye, hasel-wodes shaken!                      890
  Ye, nece myn, that ring moste han a stoon
  That mighte dede men alyve maken;
  And swich a ring, trowe I that ye have noon.
  Discrecioun out of your heed is goon;
  That fele I now,' quod he, 'and that is routhe;                       895
  O tyme y-lost, wel maystow cursen slouthe!

  129. Wot ye not wel that noble and heigh corage
  Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth eek for lyte?
  But if a fool were in a Ialous rage,
  I nolde setten at his sorwe a myte,                                   900
  But feffe him with a fewe wordes whyte
  Another day, whan that I mighte him finde:
  But this thing stont al in another kinde.

  130. This is so gentil and so tendre of herte,
  That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;                          905
  For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte,
  He wol to yow no Ialouse wordes speke.
  And for-thy, nece, er that his herte breke,
  So spek your-self to him of this matere;
  For with o word ye may his herte stere.                               910

  131. Now have I told what peril he is inne,
  And his coming unwist is to every wight;
  Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon ne sinne;
  I wol my-self be with yow al this night.
  Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,                              915
  And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,
  And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste.'

  132. This accident so pitous was to here,
  And eek so lyk a sooth, at pryme face,
  And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,                                920
  His privè coming, and the siker place,
  That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace,
  Considered alle thinges as they stode,
  No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode.

  133. Cryseyde answerde, 'as wisly god at reste                        925
  My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!
  And eem, y-wis, fayn wolde I doon the beste,
  If that I hadde grace to do so.
  But whether that ye dwelle or for him go,
  I am, til god me bettre minde sende,                                  930
  At dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende.'

  134. Quod Pandarus, 'ye, nece, wol ye here?
  Dulcarnon called is "fleminge of wrecches";
  It semeth hard, for wrecches wol not lere
  For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches;                          935
  This seyd by hem that be not worth two fecches.
  But ye ben wys, and that we han on honde
  Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde.'

  135. 'Thanne, eem,' quod she, 'doth her-of as yow list;
  But er he come I wil up first aryse;                                  940
  And, for the love of god, sin al my trist
  Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse,
  So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse,
  That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;
  For I am here al in your governaunce.'                                945

  136. 'That is wel seyd,' quod he, 'my nece dere,
  Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte!
  But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here,
  It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;
  And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,                             950
  For love of god; and, Venus, I thee herie;
  For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.'

  137. This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette
  Ful sobrely, right by hir beddes heed,
  And in his beste wyse his lady grette;                                955
  But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed!
  Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed,
  She coude nought a word a-right out-bringe
  So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge.

  138. But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele                             960
  In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,
  And seyde, 'nece, see how this lord can knele!
  Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!'
  And with that word he for a quisshen ran,
  And seyde, 'kneleth now, whyl that yow leste,                         965
  Ther god your hertes bringe sone at reste!'

  139. Can I not seyn, for she bad him not ryse,
  If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,
  Or elles if she toke it in the wyse
  Of duëtee, as for his observaunce;                                    970
  But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,
  That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore;
  And bad him sitte a-doun with-outen more.

  140. Quod Pandarus, 'now wol ye wel biginne;
  Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,                                   975
  Upon your beddes syde al there with-inne,
  That ech of yow the bet may other here.'
  And with that word he drow him to the fere,
  And took a light, and fond his contenaunce
  As for to loke up-on an old romaunce.                                 980

  141. Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,
  And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,
  Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight
  Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse,
  Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,                              985
  And that love is in cause of swich folye,
  Thus to him spak she of his Ielousye:

  142. 'Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence
  Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,
  Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence                                 990
  And eek bycause I felte wel and say
  Your grete trouthe, and servyse every day;
  And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne,
  This droof me for to rewe up-on your peyne.

  143. And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,                      995
  Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,
  I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,
  Al can I nought as muche as it were right;
  And I, emforth my conninge and my might,
  Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,                           1000
  Ben to yow trewe and hool, with al myn herte;

  144. And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve.---
  But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne
  Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,
  Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne.                        1005
  For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne,
  That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse,
  Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.

  145. My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how
  That Ialousye, allas! that wikked wivere,                            1010
  Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow;
  The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere!
  Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere,
  Shuld have his refut in so digne a place,
  Ther Iove him sone out of your herte arace!                          1015

  146. But O, thou Iove, O auctor of nature,
  Is this an honour to thy deitee,
  That folk ungiltif suffren here iniure,
  And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?
  O were it leful for to pleyne on thee,                               1020
  That undeserved suffrest Ialousye,
  And that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye!

  147. Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen
  To seyn right thus, "ye, Ialousye is love!"
  And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,                                1025
  For that o greyn of love is on it shove!
  But that wot heighe god that sit above,
  If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame;
  And after that, it oughte bere his name.

  148. But certeyn is, som maner Ialousye                              1030
  Is excusable more than som, y-wis.
  As whan cause is, and som swich fantasye
  With pietee so wel repressed is,
  That it unnethe dooth or seyth amis,
  But goodly drinketh up al his distresse;                             1035
  And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.

  149. And som so ful of furie is and despyt,
  That it sourmounteth his repressioun;
  But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt,
  That thanke I god, for whiche your passioun                          1040
  I wol not calle it but illusioun,
  Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,
  That dooth your herte this disese endure.

  150. Of which I am right sory, but not wrooth;
  But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,                            1045
  Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth,
  By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste,
  For love of god, lat preve it for the beste!
  And if that I be giltif, do me deye,
  Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?'                             1050

  151. With that a fewe brighte teres newe
  Out of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde,
  'Now god, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe
  To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.'
  With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde,                        1055
  And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore,
  And held hir pees; not o word spak she more.

  152. But now help god to quenchen al this sorwe,
  So hope I that he shal, for he best may;
  For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe                                1060
  Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day;
  And after winter folweth grene May.
  Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories,
  That after sharpe shoures been victories.

  153. This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,                         1065
  Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe;
  For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde
  To here or seen Criseyde his lady wepe;
  But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,
  For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,                          1070
  The crampe of deeth, to streyne him by the herte.

  154. And in his minde he gan the tyme acurse
  That he cam therë, and that he was born;
  For now is wikke y-turned in-to worse,
  And al that labour he hath doon biforn,                              1075
  He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.
  'O Pandarus,' thoughte he, 'allas! thy wyle
  Serveth of nought, so weylawey the whyle!'

  155. And therwithal he heng a-doun the heed,
  And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte;                           1080
  What mighte he seyn? he felte he nas but deed,
  For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte.
  But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,
  Than seyde he thus, 'god woot, that of this game,
  Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!'                            1085

  156. Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette,
  That from his eyen fil ther not a tere,
  And every spirit his vigour in-knette,
  So they astoned and oppressed were.
  The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,                             1090
  Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;
  And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.

  157. This was no litel sorwe for to see;
  But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,
  'O nece, pees, or we be lost,' quod he,                              1095
  Beth nought agast;' but certeyn, at the laste,
  For this or that, he in-to bedde him caste,
  And seyde, 'O theef, is this a mannes herte?'
  And of he rente al to his bare sherte;

  158. And seyde, 'nece, but ye helpe us now,                          1100
  Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!'
  'Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,
  Ful fayn,' quod she; 'allas! that I was born!'
  'Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn
  That stiketh in his herte?' quod Pandare;                            1105
  'Sey "al foryeve," and stint is al this fare!'

  159. 'Ye, that to me,' quod she, 'ful lever were
  Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth';
  And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere,
  'Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,                           1110
  Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;
  Now speek to me, for it am I, Cryseyde!'
  But al for nought; yet mighte he not a-breyde.

  160. Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes
  They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne,                      1115
  And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,
  She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,
  Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne.
  And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,
  And of his swough sone after that adawe,                             1120

  161. And gan bet minde and reson to him take,
  But wonder sore he was abayst, y-wis.
  And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake,
  He seyde, 'O mercy, god, what thing is this?'
  'Why do ye with your-selven thus amis?'                              1125
  Quod tho Criseyde, 'is this a mannes game?
  What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?'

  162. And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde,
  And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste.
  He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde                           1130
  As fil to purpos for his herte reste.
  And she to that answerde him as hir leste;
  And with hir goodly wordes him disporte
  She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.

  163. Quod Pandarus, 'for ought I can espyen,                         1135
  This light nor I ne serven here of nought;
  Light is not good for syke folkes yën.
  But for the love of god, sin ye be brought
  In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought
  Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye:'                            1140
  And bar the candele to the chimeneye.

  164. Sone after this, though it no nede were,
  Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse
  Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,
  Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse.                         1145
  Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse
  In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,
  That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.

  165. But in effect she wolde wite anoon
  Of what man, and eek where, and also why                             1150
  He Ielous was, sin ther was cause noon;
  And eek the signe, that he took it by,
  She bad him that to telle hir bisily,
  Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde,
  That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.                           1155

  166. With-outen more, shortly for to seyne,
  He moste obeye un-to his lady heste;
  And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.
  He seyde hir, whan she was at swiche a feste
  She mighte on him han loked at the leste;                            1160
  Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe,
  As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.

  167. And she answerde, 'swete, al were it so,
  What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene?
  For, by that god that boughte us bothe two,                          1165
  In alle thinge is myn entente clene.
  Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;
  Wol ye the childish Ialous contrefete?
  Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.'

  168. Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke,                              1170
  Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde;
  And seyde, 'allas! upon my sorwes syke
  Have mercy, swete herte myn, Cryseyde!
  And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde,
  Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;                                1175
  Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.'

  169. And she answerde, 'of gilt misericorde!
  That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;
  And ever-more on this night yow recorde,
  And beth wel war ye do no more amis.'                                1180
  'Nay, dere herte myn,' quod he, 'y-wis.'
  'And now,' quod she, 'that I have do yow smerte,
  Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.'

  170. This Troilus, with blisse of that supprysed,
  Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente                              1185
  No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed,
  He hir in armes faste to him hente.
  And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,
  Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, 'if ye ben wyse,
  Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.'                             1190

  171. What mighte or may the sely larke seye,
  Whan that the sparhauk hath it in his foot?
  I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye,
  To whom this tale sucre be or soot,
  Though that I tarie a yeer, som-tyme I moot,                         1195
  After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,
  As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.

  172. Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take,
  As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,
  Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,                             1200
  Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.
  But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,
  Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;
  Thus sondry peynes bringen folk to hevene.

  173. This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne,                          1205
  And seyde, 'O swete, as ever mote I goon,
  Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne;
  Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.'
  To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,
  'Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere,                             1210
  Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here!'

  174. O! sooth is seyd, that heled for to be
  As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse,
  Men moste drinke, as men may often see,
  Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,                          1215
  Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse;
  I mene it here, as for this aventure,
  That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure.

  175. And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,
  That bitternesse assayed was biforn;                                 1220
  For out of wo in blisse now they flete.
  Non swich they felten, sith they were born;
  Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!
  For love of god, take every womman hede
  To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.                             1225

  176. Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,
  As she that iuste cause hadde him to triste,
  Made him swich feste, it Ioye was to sene,
  Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.
  And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,                            1230
  Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde,
  Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.

  177. And as the newe abaysshed nightingale,
  That stinteth first whan she biginneth singe,
  Whan that she hereth any herde tale,                                 1235
  Or in the hegges any wight steringe,
  And after siker dooth hir voys out-ringe;
  Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,
  Opned hir herte, and tolde him hir entente.

  178. And right as he that seeth his deeth y-shapen,                  1240
  And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse,
  And sodeynly rescous doth him escapen,
  And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse,
  For al this world, in swich present gladnesse
  Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;                                1245
  With worse hap god lat us never mete!

  179. Hir armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe,
  Hir sydes longe, fleshly, smothe, and whyte
  He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte
  Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte;                     1250
  Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte,
  And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste;
  That, what to done, for Ioye unnethe he wiste.

  180. Than seyde he thus, 'O, Love, O, Charitee,
  Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,                                   1255
  After thy-self next heried be she,
  Venus mene I, the wel-willy planete;
  And next that, Imenëus, I thee grete;
  For never man was to yow goddes holde
  As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.                          1260

  181. Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,
  Who-so wol grace, and list thee nought honouren,
  Lo, his desyr wol flee with-outen winges.
  For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren
  That serven best and most alwey labouren,                            1265
  Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes,
  But-if thy grace passed our desertes.

  182. And for thou me, that coude leest deserve
  Of hem that nombred been un-to thy grace,
  Hast holpen, ther I lykly was to sterve,                             1270
  And me bistowed in so heygh a place
  That thilke boundes may no blisse pace,
  I can no more, but laude and reverence
  Be to thy bounte and thyn excellence!'

  183. And therwith-al Criseyde anoon he kiste,                        1275
  Of which, certeyn, she felte no disese.
  And thus seyde he, 'now wolde god I wiste,
  Myn herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!
  What man,' quod he, 'was ever thus at ese
  As I, on whiche the faireste and the beste                           1280
  That ever I say, deyneth hir herte reste.

  184. Here may men seen that mercy passeth right;
  The experience of that is felt in me,
  That am unworthy to so swete a wight.
  But herte myn, of your benignitee,                                   1285
  So thenketh, though that I unworthy be,
  Yet mot I nede amenden in som wyse,
  Right thourgh the vertu of your heyghe servyse.

  185. And for the love of god, my lady dere,
  Sin god hath wrought me for I shal yow serve,                        1290
  As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere,
  To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve,
  So techeth me how that I may deserve
  Your thank, so that I, thurgh myn ignoraunce,
  Ne do no-thing that yow be displesaunce.                             1295

  186. For certes, fresshe wommanliche wyf,
  This dar I seye, that trouthe and diligence,
  That shal ye finden in me al my lyf,
  Ne I wol not, certeyn, breken your defence;
  And if I do, present or in absence,                                  1300
  For love of god, lat slee me with the dede,
  If that it lyke un-to your womanhede.'

  187. 'Y-wis,' quod she, 'myn owne hertes list,
  My ground of ese, and al myn herte dere,
  Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist;                            1305
  But late us falle awey fro this matere;
  For it suffyseth, this that seyd is here.
  And at o word, with-outen repentaunce,
  Wel-come, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!'

  188. Of hir delyt, or Ioyes oon the leste                            1310
  Were impossible to my wit to seye;
  But iuggeth, ye that han ben at the feste,
  Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pleye!
  I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweye
  That night, be-twixen dreed and sikernesse,                          1315
  Felten in love the grete worthinesse.

  189. O blisful night, of hem so longe y-sought,
  How blithe un-to hem bothe two thou were!
  Why ne hadde I swich on with my soule y-bought,
  Ye, or the leeste Ioye that was there?                               1320
  A-wey, thou foule daunger and thou fere,
  And lat hem in this hevene blisse dwelle,
  That is so heygh, that al ne can I telle!

  190. But sooth is, though I can not tellen al,
  As can myn auctor, of his excellence,                                1325
  Yet have I seyd, and, god to-forn, I shal
  In every thing al hoolly his sentence.
  And if that I, at loves reverence,
  Have any word in eched for the beste,
  Doth therwith-al right as your-selven leste.                         1330

  191. For myne wordes, here and every part,
  I speke hem alle under correccioun
  Of yow, that feling han in loves art,
  And putte it al in your discrecioun
  To encrese or maken diminucioun                                      1335
  Of my langage, and that I yow bi-seche;
  But now to purpos of my rather speche.

  192. Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,
  So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were,
  That ech from other wende been biraft,                               1340
  Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,
  That al this thing but nyce dremes were;
  For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, 'O swete,
  Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?'

  193. And, lord! so he gan goodly on hir see,                         1345
  That never his look ne bleynte from hir face,
  And seyde, 'O dere herte, may it be
  That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?'
  'Ye, herte myn, god thank I of his grace!'
  Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste,                        1350
  That where his spirit was, for Ioye he niste.

  194. This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two
  Gan for to kisse, and seyde, 'O eyen clere,
  It were ye that wroughte me swich wo,
  Ye humble nettes of my lady dere!                                    1355
  Though ther be mercy writen in your chere,
  God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde,
  How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?'

  195. Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take,
  And wel an hundred tymes gan he syke,                                1360
  Nought swiche sorwful sykes as men make
  For wo, or elles whan that folk ben syke,
  But esy sykes, swiche as been to lyke,
  That shewed his affeccioun with-inne;
  Of swiche sykes coude he nought bilinne.                             1365

  196. Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges,
  As fil to purpos of this aventure,
  And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,
  Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;
  But wel I woot a broche, gold and asure,                             1370
  In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte,
  Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.

  197. Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wrecche,
  That blameth love and holt of it despyt,
  That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche,                      1375
  Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delyt,
  As is in love, in oo poynt, in som plyt?
  Nay, doutelees, for also god me save,
  So parfit Ioye may no nigard have!

  198. They wol sey 'yis,' but lord! so that they lye,                 1380
  Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!
  They callen love a woodnesse or folye,
  But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;
  They shul forgo the whyte and eke the rede,
  And live in wo, ther god yeve hem mischaunce,                        1385
  And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!

  199. As wolde god, tho wrecches, that dispyse
  Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe
  As hadde Myda, ful of coveityse;
  And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge                        1390
  As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge,
  To techen hem that they ben in the vyce,
  And loveres nought, al-though they holde hem nyce!

  200. Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye,
  Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,                               1395
  Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye,
  And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where,
  They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere
  That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,
  I thanke it god, was tourned to gladnesse.                           1400

  201. And ever-mo, whan that hem fel to speke
  Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon,
  With kissing al that tale sholde breke,
  And fallen in a newe Ioye anoon,
  And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,                           1405
  For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,
  And passed wo with Ioye countrepeyse.

  202. Reson wil not that I speke of sleep,
  For it accordeth nought to my matere;
  God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep,                          1410
  But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,
  Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere,
  It was biset in Ioye and bisinesse
  Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse.

  203. But whan the cok, comune astrologer,                            1415
  Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe,
  And Lucifer, the dayes messager,
  Gan for to ryse, and out hir bemes throwe;
  And estward roos, to him that coude it knowe,
  _Fortuna maior_, [than] anoon Criseyde,                              1420
  With herte sore, to Troilus thus seyde:--

  204. 'Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce,
  That I was born, allas! what me is wo,
  That day of us mot make desseveraunce!
  For tyme it is to ryse, and hennes go,                               1425
  Or elles I am lost for evermo!
  O night, allas! why niltow over us hove,
  As longe as whanne Almena lay by Iove?

  205. O blake night, as folk in bokes rede,
  That shapen art by god this world to hyde                            1430
  At certeyn tymes with thy derke wede,
  That under that men mighte in reste abyde,
  Wel oughte bestes pleyne, and folk thee chyde,
  That there-as day with labour wolde us breste,
  That thou thus fleest, and deynest us nought reste!                  1435

  206. Thou dost, allas! to shortly thyn offyce,
  Thou rakel night, ther god, makere of kinde,
  Thee, for thyn hast and thyn unkinde vyce,
  So faste ay to our hemi-spere binde,
  That never-more under the ground thou winde!                         1440
  For now, for thou so hyest out of Troye,
  Have I forgon thus hastily my Ioye!'

  207. This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,
  As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse,
  The blody teres from his herte melte,                                1445
  As he that never yet swich hevinesse
  Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse,
  Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere
  In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere:--

  208. 'O cruel day, accusour of the Ioye                              1450
  That night and love han stole and faste y-wryen,
  A-cursed be thy coming in-to Troye,
  For every bore hath oon of thy bright yën!
  Envyous day, what list thee so to spyen?
  What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,                           1455
  Ther god thy lyght so quenche, for his grace?

  209. Allas! what han thise loveres thee agilt,
  Dispitous day? thyn be the pyne of helle!
  For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;
  Thy pouring in wol no-wher lete hem dwelle.                          1460
  What proferestow thy light here for to selle?
  Go selle it hem that smale seles graven,
  We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.'

  210. And eek the sonne Tytan gan he chyde,
  And seyde, 'O fool, wel may men thee dispyse,                        1465
  That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde,
  And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse,
  For to disesen loveres in this wyse.
  What! hold your bed ther, thou, and eek thy Morwe!
  I bidde god, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!'                               1470

  211. Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde,
  'My lady right, and of my wele or wo
  The welle and rote, O goodly myn, Criseyde,
  And shal I ryse, allas! and shal I go?
  Now fele I that myn herte moot a-two!                                1475
  For how sholde I my lyf an houre save,
  Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have?

  212. What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,
  Ne whanne, allas! I shal the tyme see,
  That in this plyt I may be eft with yow;                             1480
  And of my lyf, god woot, how that shal be,
  Sin that desyr right now so byteth me,
  That I am deed anoon, but I retourne.
  How sholde I longe, allas! fro yow soiourne?

  213. But nathelees, myn owene lady bright,                           1485
  Yit were it so that I wiste outrely,
  That I, your humble servaunt and your knight,
  Were in your herte set so fermely
  As ye in myn, the which thing, trewely,
  Me lever were than thise worldes tweyne,                             1490
  Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peyne.'

  214. To that Cryseyde answerde right anoon,
  And with a syk she seyde, 'O herte dere,
  The game, y-wis, so ferforth now is goon,
  That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,                          1495
  And every egle been the dowves fere,
  And every roche out of his place sterte,
  Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!

  215. Ye be so depe in-with myn herte grave,
  That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought,                     1500
  As wisly verray god my soule save,
  To dyen in the peyne, I coude nought!
  And, for the love of god that us hath wrought,
  Lat in your brayn non other fantasye
  So crepe, that it cause me to dye!                                   1505

  216. And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde
  As I have yow, that wolde I yow bi-seche;
  And, if I wiste soothly that to finde,
  God mighte not a poynt my Ioyes eche!
  But, herte myn, with-oute more speche,                               1510
  Beth to me trewe, or elles were it routhe;
  For I am thyn, by god and by my trouthe!

  217. Beth glad for-thy, and live in sikernesse;
  Thus seyde I never er this, ne shal to mo;
  And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse                               1515
  To turne ayein, soone after that ye go,
  As fayn wolde I as ye, it were so,
  As wisly god myn herte bringe at reste!'
  And him in armes took, and ofte keste.

  218. Agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be,                            1520
  This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,
  And in his armes took his lady free
  An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde,
  And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,
  He seyde, 'farewel, my dere herte swete,                             1525
  Ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!'

  219. To which no word for sorwe she answerde,
  So sore gan his parting hir destreyne;
  And Troilus un-to his palays ferde,
  As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;                             1530
  So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne
  For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,
  That it may never out of his remembraunce.

  220. Retorned to his real palais, sone
  He softe in-to his bed gan for to slinke,                            1535
  To slepe longe, as he was wont to done,
  But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,
  But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke;
  Thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende,
  A thousand-fold was worth more than he wende.                        1540

  221. And in his thought gan up and doun to winde
  Hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce,
  And fermely impressen in his minde
  The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce;
  And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce,                             1545
  Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede
  Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.

  222. Criseyde also, right in the same wyse,
  Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette
  His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse,                           1550
  His gentilesse, and how she with him mette,
  Thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette;
  Desyring eft to have hir herte dere
  In swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere.

  223. Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was                           1555
  Un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete,
  Seyde, 'al this night so reyned it, allas!
  That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,
  Han litel layser had to slepe and mete;
  Al night,' quod he, 'hath reyn so do me wake,                        1560
  That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.'

  224. And ner he com, and seyde, 'how stont it now
  This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?'
  Criseyde answerde, 'never the bet for yow,
  Fox that ye been, god yeve your herte care!                          1565
  God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare,
  Trow I,' quod she, 'for alle your wordes whyte;
  O! who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!'

  225. With that she gan hir face for to wrye
  With the shete, and wex for shame al reed;                           1570
  And Pandarus gan under for to prye,
  And seyde, 'nece, if that I shal ben deed,
  Have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.'
  With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste
  Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste.                         1575

  226. I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye,
  What! God foryaf his deeth, and she al-so
  Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,
  For other cause was ther noon than so.
  But of this thing right to the effect to go,                         1580
  Whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente,
  And Pandarus hath fully his entente.

  227. Now torne we ayein to Troilus,
  That resteles ful longe a-bedde lay,
  And prevely sente after Pandarus,                                    1585
  To him to come in al the haste he may.
  He com anoon, nought ones seyde he 'nay,'
  And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,
  And doun upon his beddes syde him sette.

  228. This Troilus, with al the affeccioun                            1590
  Of frendes love that herte may devyse,
  To Pandarus on kneës fil adoun,
  And er that he wolde of the place aryse,
  He gan him thonken in his beste wyse;
  A hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse,                              1595
  That he was born to bringe him fro distresse.

  229. He seyde, 'O frend, of frendes the alderbeste
  That ever was, the sothe for to telle,
  Thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste
  Fro Flegiton, the fery flood of helle;                               1600
  That, though I mighte a thousand tymes selle,
  Upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse,
  It mighte nought a mote in that suffyse.

  230. The sonne, which that al the world may see,
  Saw never yet, my lyf, that dar I leye,                              1605
  So inly fair and goodly as is she,
  Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deye;
  And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,
  That thanked be the heighe worthinesse
  Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.                                1610

  231. Thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive,
  Fo which to thee obliged be for ay
  My lyf, and why? for thorugh thyn help I live;
  For elles deed hadde I be many a day.'
  And with that word doun in his bed he lay,                           1615
  And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde
  Til al was seyd, and thanne he him answerde:

  232. 'My dere frend, if I have doon for thee
  In any cas, god wot, it is me leef;
  And am as glad as man may of it be,                                  1620
  God help me so; but tak now not a-greef
  That I shal seyn, be war of this myscheef,
  That, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse,
  That thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse.

  233. For of fortunes sharp adversitee                                1625
  The worst kinde of infortune is this,
  A man to have ben in prosperitee,
  And it remembren, whan it passed is.
  Thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis;
  Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme,                            1630
  For if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme.

  234. Thou art at ese, and holde thee wel ther-inne.
  For also seur as reed is every fyr,
  As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne;
  Brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr.                           1635
  For worldly Ioye halt not but by a wyr;
  That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte;
  For-thy nede is to werke with it softe.'

  235. Quod Troilus, 'I hope, and god to-forn,
  My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,                               1640
  That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,
  Ne I nil not rakle as for to greven here;
  It nedeth not this matere ofte tere;
  For wistestow myn herte wel, Pandare,
  God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.'                          1645

  236. Tho gan he telle him of his glade night.
  And wher-of first his herte dredde, and how,
  And seyde, 'freend, as I am trewe knight,
  And by that feyth I shal to god and yow,
  I hadde it never half so hote as now;                                1650
  And ay the more that desyr me byteth
  To love hir best, the more it me delyteth.

  237. I noot my-self not wisly what it is;
  But now I fele a newe qualitee,
  Ye, al another than I dide er this.'                                 1655
  Pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he
  That ones may in hevene blisse be,
  He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,
  Than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye.

  238. This is o word for al; this Troilus                             1660
  Was never ful, to speke of this matere,
  And for to preysen un-to Pandarus
  The bountee of his righte lady dere,
  And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.
  This tale ay was span-newe to biginne                                1665
  Til that the night departed hem a-twinne.

  239. Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde,
  I-comen was the blisful tyme swete,
  That Troilus was warned that he sholde,
  Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete;                            1670
  For which he felte his herte in Ioye flete;
  And feythfully gan alle the goddes herie;
  And lat see now if that he can be merie.

  240. And holden was the forme and al the wyse,
  Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,                                 1675
  As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse.
  But playnly to the effect right for to go,
  In Ioye and seurte Pandarus hem two
  A-bedde broughte, whan hem bothe leste,
  And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.                            1680

  241. Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met,
  To aske at me if that they blythe were;
  For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet
  A thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere.
  A-gon was every sorwe and every fere;                                1685
  And bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende,
  As muche Ioye as herte may comprende.

  242. This is no litel thing of for to seye,
  This passeth every wit for to devyse;
  For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye;                              1690
  Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse
  Commenden so, ne may not here suffyse.
  This Ioye may not writen been with inke,
  This passeth al that herte may bithinke.

  243. But cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde!                         1695
  Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,
  For whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde;
  So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe,
  And day they gonnen to dispyse al newe,
  Calling it traytour, envyous, and worse,                             1700
  And bitterly the dayes light they curse.

  244. Quod Troilus, 'allas! now am I war
  That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,
  Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char,
  Han goon som by-path in despyt of me;                                1705
  That maketh it so sone day to be;
  And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse,
  Ne shal I never doon him sacrifyse!'

  245. But nedes day departe moste hem sone,
  And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere,                        1710
  They twinne anoon as they were wont to done,
  And setten tyme of meting eft y-fere;
  And many a night they wroughte in this manere.
  And thus Fortune a tyme ladde in Ioye
  Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye.                         1715

  246. In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges,
  This Troilus gan al his lyf to lede;
  He spendeth, Iusteth, maketh festeyinges;
  He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,
  And held aboute him alwey, out of drede,                             1720
  A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde,
  The fressheste and the beste he coude fynde;

  247. That swich a voys was of hym and a stevene
  Thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse,
  That it up rong un-to the yate of hevene.                            1725
  And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse,
  That in his herte he demede, as I gesse,
  That there nis lovere in this world at ese
  So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese.

  248. The godlihede or beautee which that kinde                       1730
  In any other lady hadde y-set
  Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde,
  A-boute his herte, of al Criseydes net.
  He was so narwe y-masked and y-knet,
  That it undon on any manere syde,                                    1735
  That nil not been, for ought that may betyde.

  249. And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take
  This Pandarus, and in-to gardin lede,
  And swich a feste and swich a proces make
  Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede,                               1740
  And of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede,
  It was an hevene his wordes for to here;
  And thanne he wolde singe in this manere.

  250. 'Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce,
  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye,                            1745
  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
  Halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye,
  Love, that knetteth lawe of companye,
  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle,
  Bind this acord, that I have told and telle;                         1750

  251. That that the world with feyth, which that is stable,
  Dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge,
  That elements that been so discordable
  Holden a bond perpetuely duringe,
  That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe,                          1755
  And that the mone hath lordship over the nightes,
  Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes!

  252. That that the see, that gredy is to flowen,
  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
  His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen                            1760
  To drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo;
  And if that Love ought lete his brydel go,
  Al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe,
  And lost were al, that Love halt now to-hepe.

  253. So wolde god, that auctor is of kinde,                          1765
  That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste
  To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde,
  That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste.
  And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste
  To make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe                         1770
  On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.'

  254. In alle nedes, for the tounes werre,
  He was, and ay the firste in armes dight;
  And certeynly, but-if that bokes erre,
  Save Ector, most y-drad of any wight;                                1775
  And this encrees of hardinesse and might
  Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne,
  That altered his spirit so with-inne.

  255. In tyme of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ryde,
  Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun;                                1780
  The smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde.
  And whan that he com rydinge in-to toun,
  Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun,
  As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe,
  Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe.                                  1785

  256. And most of love and vertu was his speche,
  And in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse;
  And doutelees, no nede was him biseche
  To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse,
  And esen hem that weren in distresse.                                1790
  And glad was he if any wight wel ferde,
  That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde.

  257. For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight
  But-if he were in loves heigh servyse,
  I mene folk that oughte it been of right.                            1795
  And over al this, so wel coude he devyse
  Of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse
  Al his array, that every lover thoughte,
  That al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte.

  258. And though that he be come of blood royal,                      1800
  Him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase;
  Benigne he was to ech in general,
  For which he gat him thank in every place.
  Thus wolde Love, y-heried be his grace,
  That Pryde, Envye, Ire, and Avaryce                                  1805
  He gan to flee, and every other vyce.

  259. Thou lady bright, the doughter to Dione,
  Thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun Cupyde;
  Ye sustren nyne eek, that by Elicone
  In hil Parnaso listen for to abyde,                                  1810
  That ye thus fer han deyned me to gyde,
  I can no more, but sin that ye wol wende,
  Ye heried been for ay, with-outen ende!

  260. Thourgh yow have I seyd fully in my song
  Theffect and Ioye of Troilus servyse,                                1815
  Al be that ther was som disese among,
  As to myn auctor listeth to devyse.
  My thridde book now ende ich in this wyse;
  And Troilus in luste and in quiete
  Is with Criseyde, his owne herte swete.                              1820

[PROHEMIUM.]

  1. But al to litel, weylawey the whyle,
  Lasteth swich Ioye, y-thonked be Fortune!
  That semeth trewest, whan she wol bygyle,
  And can to foles so hir song entune,
  That she hem hent and blent, traytour comune;                           5
  And whan a wight is from hir wheel y-throwe,
  Than laugheth she, and maketh him the mowe.

  2. From Troilus she gan hir brighte face
  Awey to wrythe, and took of him non hede,
  But caste him clene oute of his lady grace,                            10
  And on hir wheel she sette up Diomede;
  For which right now myn herte ginneth blede,
  And now my penne, allas! with which I wryte,
  Quaketh for drede of that I moot endyte.

  3. For how Criseyde Troilus forsook,                                   15
  Or at the leste, how that she was unkinde,
  Mot hennes-forth ben matere of my book,
  As wryten folk thorugh which it is in minde.
  Allas! that they shulde ever cause finde
  To speke hir harm; and if they on hir lye,                             20
  Y-wis, hem-self sholde han the vilanye.

  4. O ye Herines, Nightes doughtren three,
  That endelees compleynen ever in pyne,
  Megera, Alete, and eek Thesiphone;
  Thou cruel Mars eek, fader to Quiryne,                                 25
  This ilke ferthe book me helpeth fyne,
  So that the los of lyf and love y-fere
  Of Troilus be fully shewed here.

EXPLICIT [PROHEMIUM]. INCIPIT QUARTUS LIBER.

  5. Ligginge in ost, as I have seyd er this,
  The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun,                                 30
  Bifel that, whan that Phebus shyning is
  Up-on the brest of Hercules Lyoun,
  That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun,
  Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte,
  As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte.                            35

  6. Not I how longe or short it was bitwene
  This purpos and that day they fighte mente;
  But on a day wel armed, bright and shene,
  Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente,
  With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente;                              40
  And in the berd, with-oute lenger lette,
  Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette.

  7. The longe day, with speres sharpe y-grounde,
  With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle,
  They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde,                       45
  And with hir axes out the braynes quelle.
  But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle,
  The folk of Troye hem-selven so misledden,
  That with the worse at night homward they fledden.

  8. At whiche day was taken Antenor,                                    50
  Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo,
  Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor,
  Polyte, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo,
  And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo.
  So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye                          55
  Dredden to lese a greet part of hir Ioye.

  9. Of Pryamus was yeve, at Greek requeste,
  A tyme of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete,
  Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste,
  And for the surplus yeven sommes grete.                                60
  This thing anoon was couth in every strete,
  Bothe in thassege, in toune, and every-where,
  And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere.

  10. Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,
  In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone                                 65
  He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,
  And sette him there-as he was wont to done;
  And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,
  For love of god, to don that reverence,
  To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience.                                70

  11. Thanne seyde he thus, 'lo! lordes myne, I was
  Troian, as it is knowen out of drede;
  And if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,
  That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,
  And tolde wel how that ye sholden spede.                               75
  For dredelees, thorugh yow, shal, in a stounde,
  Ben Troye y-brend, and beten doun to grounde.

  12. And in what forme, or in what maner wyse
  This town to shende, and al your lust to acheve,
  Ye han er this wel herd it me devyse;                                  80
  This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.
  And for the Grekes weren me so leve,
  I com my-self in my propre persone,
  To teche in this how yow was best to done;

  13. Havinge un-to my tresour ne my rente                               85
  Right no resport, to respect of your ese.
  Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente,
  Wening in this you, lordes, for to plese.
  But al that los ne doth me no disese.
  I vouche-sauf, as wisly have I Ioye,                                   90
  For you to lese al that I have in Troye,

  14. Save of a doughter, that I lafte, allas!
  Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte.
  O sterne, O cruel fader that I was!
  How mighte I have in that so hard an herte?                            95
  Allas! I ne hadde y-brought hir in hir sherte!
  For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe,
  But-if ye lordes rewe up-on my sorwe.

  15. For, by that cause I say no tyme er now
  Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees;                               100
  But now or never, if that it lyke yow,
  I may hir have right sone, doutelees.
  O help and grace! amonges al this prees,
  Rewe on this olde caitif in destresse,
  Sin I through yow have al this hevinesse!                             105

  16. Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun
  Troians y-nowe; and if your willes be,
  My child with oon may have redempcioun.
  Now for the love of god and of bountee,
  Oon of so fele, allas! so yeve him me.                                110
  What nede were it this preyere for to werne,
  Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne?

  17. On peril of my lyf, I shal not lye,
  Appollo hath me told it feithfully;
  I have eek founde it by astronomye,                                   115
  By sort, and by augurie eek trewely,
  And dar wel seye, the tyme is faste by,
  That fyr and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede;
  And thus shal Troye turne in asshen dede.

  18. For certeyn, Phebus and Neptunus bothe,                           120
  That makeden the walles of the toun,
  Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe,
  That thei wol bringe it to confusioun,
  Right in despyt of king Lameadoun.
  By-cause he nolde payen hem hir hyre,                                 125
  The toun of Troye shal ben set on-fyre.'

  19. Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,
  Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,
  The salte teres from his eyën tweye
  Ful faste ronnen doun by eyther cheke.                                130
  So longe he gan of socour hem by-seke
  That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore,
  They yave him Antenor, with-oute more.

  20. But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho?
  And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde                            135
  On hem that sholden for the tretis go,
  And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde
  To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;
  And whan Pryam his save-garde sente,
  Thembassadours to Troye streyght they wente.                          140

  21. The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde
  Pryam the king ful sone in general
  Let here-upon his parlement to holde,
  Of which the effect rehersen yow I shal.
  Thembassadours ben answered for fynal,                                145
  Theschaunge of prisoners and al this nede
  Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede.

  22. This Troilus was present in the place,
  Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,
  For which ful sone chaungen gan his face,                             150
  As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde.
  But nathelees, he no word to it seyde,
  Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye;
  With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye.

  23. And ful of anguish and of grisly drede                            155
  Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye;
  And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede,
  Theschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye,
  First, how to save hir honour, and what weye
  He mighte best theschaunge of hir withstonde;                         160
  Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde.

  24. Love him made al prest to doon hir byde,
  And rather dye than she sholde go;
  But resoun seyde him, on that other syde,
  'With-oute assent of hir ne do not so,                                165
  Lest for thy werk she wolde be thy fo,
  And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe
  Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.'

  25. For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,
  That though the lordes wolde that she wente,                          170
  He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste,
  And telle his lady first what that they mente.
  And whan that she had seyd him hir entente,
  Ther-after wolde he werken also blyve,
  Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve.                            175

  26. Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,
  For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,
  Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde:--
  'Sires, she nis no prisoner,' he seyde;
  'I noot on yow who that this charge leyde,                            180
  But, on my part, ye may eft-sone him telle,
  We usen here no wommen for to selle.'

  27. The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones,
  As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre;
  For infortune it wolde, for the nones,                                185
  They sholden hir confusioun desyre.
  'Ector,' quod they, 'what goost may yow enspyre,
  This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese
  Daun Antenor?--a wrong wey now ye chese--

  28. That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun,                           190
  And we han nede of folk, as men may see;
  He is eek oon, the grettest of this toun;
  O Ector, lat tho fantasyës be!
  O king Pryam,' quod they, 'thus seggen we,
  That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde;'                             195
  And to deliveren Antenor they preyde.

  29. O Iuvenal, lord! trewe is thy sentence,
  That litel witen folk what is to yerne
  That they ne finde in hir desyr offence;
  For cloud of errour lat hem not descerne                              200
  What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.
  This folk desiren now deliveraunce
  Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!

  30. For he was after traytour to the toun
  Of Troye; allas! they quitte him out to rathe;                        205
  O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun!
  Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,
  Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;
  But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,
  And she shal out; thus seyden here and howne.                         210

  31. For which delibered was by parlement,
  For Antenor to yelden up Criseyde,
  And it pronounced by the president,
  Al-theigh that Ector 'nay' ful ofte preyde.
  And fynaly, what wight that it with-seyde,                            215
  It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde;
  For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.

  32. Departed out of parlement echone,
  This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo,
  Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,                           220
  But-if it were a man of his or two,
  The whiche he bad out faste for to go,
  By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde,
  And hastely up-on his bed him leyde.

  33. And as in winter leves been biraft,                               225
  Eche after other, til the tree be bare,
  So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft,
  Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare,
  Y-bounden in the blake bark of care,
  Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde,                               230
  So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.

  34. He rist him up, and every dore he shette
  And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man
  Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette,
  Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan;                                    235
  And in his brest the heped wo bigan
  Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse
  In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devyse.

  35. Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe
  Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte,                           240
  And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge,
  Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte,
  Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte;
  His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde
  Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde.                          245

  36. His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,
  Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye;
  The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte
  His speche him rafte, unnethes mighte he seye,
  'O deeth, allas! why niltow do me deye?                               250
  A-cursed be the day which that nature
  Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!'

  37. But after, whan the furie and the rage
  Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,
  By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage,                               255
  Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste;
  But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste,
  That wonder is, the body may suffyse
  To half this wo, which that I yow devyse.

  38. Than seyde he thus, 'Fortune! allas the whyle!                    260
  What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt?
  How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle?
  Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?
  Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?
  Allas! how maystow in thyn herte finde                                265
  To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?

  39. Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve,
  As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle?
  Why wiltow me fro Ioye thus depryve?
  O Troilus, what may men now thee calle                                270
  But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle
  In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle
  Criseyde, allas! til that the breeth me fayle?

  40. Allas, Fortune! if that my lyf in Ioye
  Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye,                                275
  Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye,
  By-raft the lyf, or doon my bretheren dye,
  Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye,
  I, combre-world, that may of no-thing serve,
  But ever dye, and never fully sterve?                                 280

  41. If that Criseyde allone were me laft,
  Nought roughte I whider thou woldest me stere;
  And hir, allas! than hastow me biraft.
  But ever-more, lo! this is thy manere,
  To reve a wight that most is to him dere,                             285
  To preve in that thy gerful violence.
  Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence!

  42. O verray lord of love, O god, allas!
  That knowest best myn herte and al my thought,
  What shal my sorwful lyf don in this cas                              290
  If I for-go that I so dere have bought?
  Sin ye Cryseyde and me han fully brought
  In-to your grace, and bothe our hertes seled,
  How may ye suffre, allas! it be repeled?

  43. What I may doon, I shal, whyl I may dure                          295
  On lyve in torment and in cruel peyne,
  This infortune or this disaventure,
  Allone as I was born, y-wis, compleyne;
  Ne never wil I seen it shyne or reyne;
  But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse                               300
  My sorwful lyf, and dyen in distresse.

  44. O wery goost, that errest to and fro,
  Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste
  Body, that ever mighte on grounde go?
  O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste,                                305
  Flee forth out of myn herte, and lat it breste,
  And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere;
  Thy righte place is now no lenger here!

  45. O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport
  Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte,                                310
  What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort,
  Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte?
  Sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte,
  In veyn fro-this-forth have I eyen tweye
  Y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye.                                  315

  46. O my Criseyde, O lady sovereyne
  Of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth,
  Who shal now yeven comfort to the peyne?
  Allas, no wight; but when myn herte dyeth,
  My spirit, which that so un-to yow hyeth,                             320
  Receyve in gree, for that shal ay yow serve;
  For-thy no fors is, though the body sterve.

  47. O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel
  Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure,
  God leve that ye finde ay love of steel,                              325
  And longe mot your lyf in Ioye endure!
  But whan ye comen by my sepulture,
  Remembreth that your felawe resteth there;
  For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were.

  48. O olde unholsom and mislyved man,                                 330
  Calkas I mene, allas! what eyleth thee
  To been a Greek, sin thou art born Troian?
  O Calkas, which that wilt my bane be,
  In cursed tyme was thou born for me!
  As wolde blisful Iove, for his Ioye,                                  335
  That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!'

  49. A thousand sykes, hottere than the glede,
  Out of his brest ech after other wente,
  Medled with pleyntes newe, his wo to fede,
  For which his woful teres never stente;                               340
  And shortly, so his peynes him to-rente,
  And wex so mat, that Ioye nor penaunce
  He feleth noon, but lyth forth in a traunce.

  50. Pandare, which that in the parlement
  Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde,                         345
  And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,
  For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,
  Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breyde,
  So that, for wo, he niste what he mente;
  But in a rees to Troilus he wente.                                    350

  51. A certeyn knight, that for the tyme kepte
  The chaumbre-dore, un-dide it him anoon;
  And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,
  In-to the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,
  Toward the bed gan softely to goon,                                   355
  So confus, that he niste what to seye;
  For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.

  52. And with his chere and loking al to-torn,
  For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,
  He stood this woful Troilus biforn,                                   360
  And on his pitous face he gan biholden;
  But lord, so often gan his herte colden,
  Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse
  His herte slow, as thoughte him, for distresse.

  53. This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte                        365
  His freend Pandare y-comen him to see,
  Gan as the snow ayein the sonne melte,
  For which this sorwful Pandare, of pitee,
  Gan for to wepe as tendreliche as he;
  And specheles thus been thise ilke tweye,                             370
  That neyther mighte o word for sorwe seye.

  54. But at the laste this woful Troilus,
  Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore,
  And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus,
  Among his sobbes and his sykes sore,                                  375
  'Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more.
  Hastow nought herd at parlement,' he seyde,
  'For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?'

  55. This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,
  Ful pitously answerde and seyde, 'yis!                                380
  As wisly were it fals as it is trewe,
  That I have herd, and wot al how it is.
  O mercy, god, who wolde have trowed this?
  Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe,
  Fortune our Ioye wolde han over-throwe?                               385

  56. For in this world ther is no creature,
  As to my doom, that ever saw ruyne
  Straungere than this, thorugh cas or aventure.
  But who may al eschewe or al devyne?
  Swich is this world; for-thy I thus defyne,                           390
  Ne trust no wight to finden in Fortune
  Ay propretee; hir yeftes been comune.

  57. But tel me this, why thou art now so mad
  To sorwen thus? Why lystow in this wyse,
  Sin thy desyr al holly hastow had,                                    395
  So that, by right, it oughte y-now suffyse?
  But I, that never felte in my servyse
  A frendly chere or loking of an yë,
  Lat me thus wepe and wayle, til I dye.

  58. And over al this, as thou wel wost thy-selve,                     400
  This town is ful of ladies al aboute;
  And, to my doom, fairer than swiche twelve
  As ever she was, shal I finde, in som route,
  Ye, oon or two, with-outen any doute.
  For-thy be glad, myn owene dere brother,                              405
  If she be lost, we shul recovere another.

  59. What, god for-bede alwey that ech plesaunce
  In o thing were, and in non other wight!
  If oon can singe, another can wel daunce;
  If this be goodly, she is glad and light;                             410
  And this is fayr, and that can good a-right.
  Ech for his vertu holden is for dere,
  Bothe heroner and faucon for rivere.

  60. And eek, as writ Zanzis, that was ful wys,
  "The newe love out chaceth ofte the olde;"                            415
  And up-on newe cas lyth newe avys.
  Thenk eek, thy-self to saven artow holde;
  Swich fyr, by proces, shal of kinde colde.
  For sin it is but casuel plesaunce,
  Som cas shal putte it out of remembraunce.                            420

  61. For al-so seur as day cometh after night,
  The newe love, labour or other wo,
  Or elles selde seinge of a wight,
  Don olde affecciouns alle over-go.
  And, for thy part, thou shalt have oon of tho                         425
  To abrigge with thy bittre peynes smerte;
  Absence of hir shal dryve hir out of herte.'

  62. Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle,
  To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deyde.
  For doutelees, to doon his wo to falle,                               430
  He roughte not what unthrift that he seyde.
  But Troilus, that neigh for sorwe deyde,
  Tok litel hede of al that ever he mente;
  Oon ere it herde, at the other out it wente:--

  63. But at the laste answerde and seyde, 'freend,                     435
  This lechecraft, or heled thus to be,
  Were wel sitting, if that I were a feend,
  To traysen hir that trewe is unto me!
  I pray god, lat this consayl never y-thee;
  But do me rather sterve anon-right here                               440
  Er I thus do as thou me woldest lere.

  64. She that I serve, y-wis, what so thou seye,
  To whom myn herte enhabit is by right,
  Shal han me holly hires til that I deye.
  For, Pandarus, sin I have trouthe hir hight,                          445
  I wol not been untrewe for no wight;
  But as hir man I wol ay live and sterve,
  And never other creature serve.

  65. And ther thou seyst, thou shall as faire finde
  As she, lat be, make no comparisoun                                   450
  To creature y-formed here by kinde.
  O leve Pandare, in conclusioun,
  I wol not be of thyn opinioun,
  Touching al this; for whiche I thee biseche,
  So hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche.                     455

  66. Thow biddest me I sholde love an-other
  Al freshly newe, and lat Criseyde go!
  It lyth not in my power, leve brother.
  And though I mighte, I wolde not do so.
  But canstow pleyen raket, to and fro,                                 460
  Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare?
  Now foule falle hir, for thy wo that care!

  67. Thow farest eek by me, thou Pandarus,
  As he, that whan a wight is wo bi-goon,
  He cometh to him a pas, and seyth right thus,                         465
  "Thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon."
  Thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon,
  And reve me my passiounes alle,
  Er thou so lightly do my wo to falle.

  68. The deeth may wel out of my brest departe                         470
  The lyf, so longe may this sorwe myne;
  But fro my soule shal Criseydes darte
  Out never-mo; but doun with Proserpyne,
  Whan I am deed, I wol go wone in pyne;
  And ther I wol eternally compleyne                                    475
  My wo, and how that twinned be we tweyne.

  69. Thow hast here maad an argument, for fyn,
  How that it sholde lasse peyne be
  Criseyde to for-goon, for she was myn,
  And live in ese and in felicitee.                                     480
  Why gabbestow, that seydest thus to me
  That "him is wors that is fro wele y-throwe,
  Than he hadde erst non of that wele y-knowe?"

  70. But tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light
  To chaungen so in love, ay to and fro,                                485
  Why hastow not don bisily thy might
  To chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo?
  Why niltow lete hir fro thyn herte go?
  Why niltow love an-other lady swete,
  That may thyn herte setten in quiete?                                 490

  71. If thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce,
  And canst it not out of thyn herte dryve,
  I, that livede in lust and in plesaunce
  With hir as muche as creature on-lyve,
  How sholde I that foryete, and that so blyve?                         495
  O where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe,
  That canst so wel and formely arguwe?

  72. Nay, nay, god wot, nought worth is al thy reed,
  For which, for what that ever may bifalle,
  With-outen wordes mo, I wol be deed.                                  500
  O deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle,
  Com now, sin I so ofte after thee calle,
  For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne,
  That, ofte y-cleped, cometh and endeth peyne.

  73. Wel wot I, whyl my lyf was in quiete,                             505
  Er thou me slowe, I wolde have yeven hyre;
  But now thy cominge is to me so swete,
  That in this world I no-thing so desyre.
  O deeth, sin with this sorwe I am a-fyre,
  Thou outher do me anoon in teres drenche,                             510
  Or with thy colde strook myn hete quenche!

  74. Sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wyse
  Ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night,
  Do me, at my requeste, this servyse,
  Delivere now the world, so dostow right,                              515
  Of me, that am the wofulleste wight
  That ever was; for tyme is that I sterve,
  Sin in this world of right nought may I serve.'

  75. This Troilus in teres gan distille,
  As licour out of alambyk ful faste;                                   520
  And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille,
  And to the ground his eyen doun he caste.
  But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste,
  'What, parde, rather than my felawe deye,
  Yet shal I som-what more un-to him seye:'                             525

  76. And seyde, 'freend, sin thou hast swich distresse,
  And sin thee list myn arguments to blame,
  Why nilt thy-selven helpen doon redresse,
  And with thy manhod letten al this grame?
  Go ravisshe hir ne canstow not for shame!                             530
  And outher lat hir out of toune fare,
  Or hold hir stille, and leve thy nyce fare.

  77. Artow in Troye, and hast non hardiment
  To take a womman which that loveth thee,
  And wolde hir-selven been of thyn assent?                             535
  Now is not this a nyce vanitee?
  Rys up anoon, and lat this weping be,
  And kyth thou art a man, for in this houre
  I wil be deed, or she shal bleven oure.'

  78. To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,                           540
  And seyde, 'parde, leve brother dere,
  Al this have I my-self yet thought ful ofte,
  And more thing than thou devysest here.
  But why this thing is laft, thou shalt wel here;
  And whan thou me hast yeve an audience,                               545
  Ther-after mayst thou telle al thy sentence.

  79. First, sin thou wost this toun hath al this werre
  For ravisshing of wommen so by might,
  It sholde not be suffred me to erre,
  As it stant now, ne doon so gret unright.                             550
  I sholde han also blame of every wight,
  My fadres graunt if that I so withstode,
  Sin she is chaunged for the tounes goode.

  80. I have eek thought, so it were hir assent,
  To aske hir at my fader, of his grace;                                555
  Than thenke I, this were hir accusement,
  Sin wel I woot I may hir not purchace.
  For sin my fader, in so heigh a place
  As parlement, hath hir eschaunge enseled,
  He nil for me his lettre be repeled.                                  560

  81. Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe
  With violence, if I do swich a game;
  For if I wolde it openly distourbe,
  It moste been disclaundre to hir name.
  And me were lever deed than hir defame,                               565
  As nolde god but-if I sholde have
  Hir honour lever than my lyf to save!

  82. Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see;
  For certeyn is, sin that I am hir knight,
  I moste hir honour levere han than me                                 570
  In every cas, as lovere oughte of right.
  Thus am I with desyr and reson twight;
  Desyr for to distourben hir me redeth,
  And reson nil not, so myn herte dredeth.'

  83. Thus wepinge that he coude never cesse,                           575
  He seyde, 'allas! how shal I, wrecche, fare?
  For wel fele I alwey my love encresse,
  And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare!
  Encressen eek the causes of my care;
  So wel-a-wey, why nil myn herte breste?                               580
  For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.'

  84. Pandare answerde, 'freend, thou mayst, for me,
  Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote,
  And thyn estat, she sholde go with me;
  Though al this toun cryede on this thing by note,                     585
  I nolde sette at al that noyse a grote.
  For when men han wel cryed, than wol they roune;
  A wonder last but nyne night never in toune.

  85. Devyne not in reson ay so depe
  Ne curteysly, but help thy-self anoon;                                590
  Bet is that othere than thy-selven wepe,
  And namely, sin ye two been al oon.
  Rys up, for by myn heed, she shal not goon;
  And rather be in blame a lyte y-founde
  Than sterve here as a gnat, with-oute wounde.                         595

  86. It is no shame un-to yow, ne no vyce
  Hir to with-holden, that ye loveth most.
  Paraunter, she mighte holden thee for nyce
  To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost.
  Thenk eek Fortune, as wel thy-selven wost,                            600
  Helpeth hardy man to his empryse,
  And weyveth wrecches, for hir cowardyse.

  87. And though thy lady wolde a litel hir greve,
  Thou shalt thy pees ful wel here-after make,
  But as for me, certayn, I can not leve                                605
  That she wolde it as now for yvel take.
  Why sholde than for ferd thyn herte quake?
  Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother,
  A love; and why shaltow not have another?

  88. And Troilus, o thing I dar thee swere,                            610
  That if Criseyde, whiche that is thy leef,
  Now loveth thee as wel as thou dost here,
  God helpe me so, she nil not take a-greef,
  Though thou do bote a-noon in this mischeef.
  And if she wilneth fro thee for to passe,                             615
  Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.

  89. For-thy tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight,
  Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe.
  Kyth now sumwhat thy corage and thy might,
  Have mercy on thy-self, for any awe.                                  620
  Lat not this wrecched wo thin herte gnawe,
  But manly set the world on sixe and sevene;
  And, if thou deye a martir, go to hevene.

  90. I wol my-self be with thee at this dede,
  Though ich and al my kin, up-on a stounde,                            625
  Shulle in a strete as dogges liggen dede,
  Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde.
  In every cas I wol a freend be founde.
  And if thee list here sterven as a wrecche,
  A-dieu, the devel spede him that it recche!'                          630

  91. This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,
  And seyde, 'freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;
  But certaynly thou mayst not me so priken,
  Ne peyne noon ne may me so tormente,
  That, for no cas, it is not myn entente,                              635
  At shorte wordes, though I dyen sholde,
  To ravisshe hir, but-if hir-self it wolde.'

  92. 'Why, so mene I,' quod Pandarus, 'al this day.
  But tel me than, hastow hir wel assayed,
  That sorwest thus?' And he answerde, 'nay.'                           640
  'Wher-of artow,' quod Pandare, 'than a-mayed,
  That nost not that she wol ben yvel apayed
  To ravisshe hir, sin thou hast not ben there,
  But-if that Iove tolde it in thyn ere?

  93. For-thy rys up, as nought ne were, anoon,                         645
  And wash thy face, and to the king thou wende,
  Or he may wondren whider thou art goon.
  Thou most with wisdom him and othere blende;
  Or, up-on cas, he may after thee sende
  Er thou be war; and shortly, brother dere,                            650
  Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere.

  94. For I shal shape it so, that sikerly
  Thou shalt this night som tyme, in som manere,
  Com speke with thy lady prevely,
  And by hir wordes eek, and by hir chere,                              655
  Thou shalt ful sone aparceyve and wel here
  Al hir entente, and in this cas the beste;
  And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.'

  95. The swifte Fame, whiche that false thinges
  Egal reporteth lyk the thinges trewe,                                 660
  Was thorugh-out Troye y-fled with preste winges
  Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,
  How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,
  At parlement, with-oute wordes more,
  I-graunted was in chaunge of Antenore.                                665

  96. The whiche tale anoon-right as Criseyde
  Had herd, she which that of hir fader roughte,
  As in this cas, right nought, ne whanne he deyde,
  Ful bisily to Iuppiter bisoughte
  Yeve him mischaunce that this tretis broughte.                        670
  But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were,
  She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.

  97. As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde
  On Troilus y-set so wonder faste,
  That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde,                        675
  Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste;
  She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste.
  And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede,
  So that she niste what was best to rede.

  98. But as men seen in toune, and al aboute,                          680
  That wommen usen frendes to visyte,
  So to Criseyde of wommen com a route
  For pitous Ioye, and wenden hir delyte;
  And with hir tales, dere y-nough a myte,
  These wommen, whiche that in the cite dwelle,                         685
  They sette hem doun, and seyde as I shal telle.

  99. Quod first that oon, 'I am glad, trewely,
  By-cause of yow, that shal your fader see.'
  A-nother seyde, 'y-wis, so nam not I;
  For al to litel hath she with us be.'                                 690
  Quod tho the thridde, 'I hope, y-wis, that she
  Shal bringen us the pees on every syde,
  That, whan she gooth, almighty god hir gyde!'

  100. Tho wordes and tho wommannisshe thinges,
  She herde hem right as though she thennes were;                       695
  For, god it wot, hir herte on other thing is,
  Although the body sat among hem there.
  Hir advertence is alwey elles-where;
  For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte;
  With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte.                           700

  101. Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese,
  Aboute nought gonne alle hir tales spende;
  Swich vanitee ne can don hir non ese,
  As she that, al this mene whyle, brende
  Of other passioun than that they wende,                               705
  So that she felte almost hir herte deye
  For wo, and wery of that companye.

  102. For which no lenger mighte she restreyne
  Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,
  That yeven signes of the bitter peyne                                 710
  In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle;
  Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle
  She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte
  Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.

  103. And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute                             715
  Wenden, that she wepte and syked sore
  By-cause that she sholde out of that route
  Departe, and never pleye with hem more.
  And they that hadde y-knowen hir of yore
  Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,                         720
  And eche of hem wepte eek for hir distresse;

  104. And bisily they gonnen hir conforten
  Of thing, god wot, on which she litel thoughte;
  And with hir tales wenden hir disporten,
  And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.                              725
  But swich an ese ther-with they hir wroughte
  Right as a man is esed for to fele,
  For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!

  105. But after al this nyce vanitee
  They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.                        730
  Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,
  In-to hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,
  And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle,
  In purpos never thennes for to ryse;
  And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse.                          735

  106. Hir ounded heer, that sonnish was of hewe,
  She rente, and eek hir fingres longe and smale
  She wrong ful ofte, and bad god on hir rewe,
  And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.
  Hir hewe, whylom bright, that tho was pale,                           740
  Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreynte;
  And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleynte:

  107. 'Alas!' quod she, 'out of this regioun
  I, woful wrecche and infortuned wight,
  And born in corsed constellacioun,                                    745
  Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight;
  Wo worth, allas! that ilke dayes light
  On which I saw him first with eyen tweyne,
  That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!'

  108. Therwith the teres from hir eyen two                             750
  Doun fille, as shour in Aperill, ful swythe;
  Hir whyte brest she bet, and for the wo
  After the deeth she cryed a thousand sythe,
  Sin he that wont hir wo was for to lythe,
  She mot for-goon; for which disaventure                               755
  She held hir-self a forlost creature.

  109. She seyde, 'how shal he doon, and I also?
  How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
  O dere herte eek, that I love so,
  Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?                           760
  O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne!
  O moder myn, that cleped were Argyve,
  Wo worth that day that thou me bere on lyve!

  110. To what fyn sholde I live and sorwen thus?
  How sholde a fish with-oute water dure?                               765
  What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus?
  How sholde a plaunte or lyves creature
  Live, with-oute his kinde noriture?
  For which ful oft a by-word here I seye,
  That, "rotelees, mot grene sone deye."                                770

  111. I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte
  Dar I non handle, for the crueltee,
  That ilke day that I from yow departe,
  If sorwe of that nil not my bane be,
  Than shal no mete or drinke come in me                                775
  Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe;
  And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe.

  112. And, Troilus, my clothes everichoon
  Shul blake been, in tokeninge, herte swete,
  That I am as out of this world agoon,                                 780
  That wont was yow to setten in quiete;
  And of myn ordre, ay til deeth me mete,
  The observaunce ever, in your absence,
  Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence.

  113. Myn herte and eek the woful goost ther-inne                      785
  Biquethe I, with your spirit to compleyne
  Eternally, for they shul never twinne.
  For though in erthe y-twinned be we tweyne,
  Yet in the feld of pitee, out of peyne,
  That hight Elysos, shul we been y-fere,                               790
  As Orpheus and Erudice his fere.

  114. Thus herte myn, for Antenor, allas!
  I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene.
  But how shul ye don in this sorwful cas,
  How shal your tendre herte this sustene?                              795
  But herte myn, for-yet this sorwe and tene,
  And me also; for, soothly for to seye,
  So ye wel fare, I recche not to deye.'

  115. How mighte it ever y-red ben or y-songe,
  The pleynte that she made in hir distresse?                           800
  I noot; but, as for me, my litel tonge,
  If I discreven wolde hir hevinesse,
  It sholde make hir sorwe seme lesse
  Than that it was, and childishly deface
  Hir heigh compleynte, and therfore I it pace.                         805

  116. Pandare, which that sent from Troilus
  Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devyse,
  That for the beste it was accorded thus,
  And he ful glad to doon him that servyse,
  Un-to Criseyde, in a ful secree wyse,                                 810
  Ther-as she lay in torment and in rage,
  Com hir to telle al hoolly his message.

  117. And fond that she hir-selven gan to trete
  Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres
  Hir brest, hir face y-bathed was ful wete;                            815
  The mighty tresses of hir sonnish heres,
  Unbroyden, hangen al aboute hir eres;
  Which yaf him verray signal of martyre
  Of deeth, which that hir herte gan desyre.

  118. Whan she him saw, she gan for sorwe anoon                        820
  Hir tery face a-twixe hir armes hyde,
  For which this Pandare is so wo bi-goon,
  That in the hous he mighte unnethe abyde,
  As he that pitee felte on every syde.
  For if Criseyde hadde erst compleyned sore,                           825
  Tho gan she pleyne a thousand tymes more.

  119. And in hir aspre pleynte than she seyde,
  'Pandare first of Ioyes mo than two
  Was cause causinge un-to me, Criseyde,
  That now transmuwed been in cruel wo.                                 830
  Wher shal I seye to yow "wel come" or no,
  That alderfirst me broughte in-to servyse
  Of love, allas! that endeth in swich wyse?

  120. Endeth than love in wo? Ye, or men lyeth!
  And alle worldly blisse, as thinketh me,                              835
  The ende of blisse ay sorwe it occupyeth;
  And who-so troweth not that it so be,
  Lat him upon me, woful wrecche, y-see,
  That my-self hate, and ay my birthe acorse,
  Felinge alwey, fro wikke I go to worse.                               840

  121. Who-so me seeth, he seeth sorwe al at ones,
  Peyne, torment, pleynte, wo, distresse.
  Out of my woful body harm ther noon is,
  As anguish, langour, cruel bitternesse,
  A-noy, smert, drede, fury, and eek siknesse.                          845
  I trowe, y-wis, from hevene teres reyne,
  For pitee of myn aspre and cruel peyne!'

  122. 'And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,'
  Quod Pandarus, 'what thenkestow to do?
  Why ne hastow to thy-selven som resport,                              850
  Why woltow thus thy-selve, allas, for-do?
  Leef al this werk and tak now hede to
  That I shal seyn, and herkne, of good entente,
  This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.'

  123. Torned hir tho Criseyde, a wo makinge                            855
  So greet that it a deeth was for to see:--
  'Allas!' quod she, 'what wordes may ye bringe?
  What wol my dere herte seyn to me,
  Which that I drede never-mo to see?
  Wol he have pleynte or teres, er I wende?                             860
  I have y-nowe, if he ther-after sende!'

  124. She was right swich to seen in hir visage
  As is that wight that men on bere binde;
  Hir face, lyk of Paradys the image,
  Was al y-chaunged in another kinde.                                   865
  The pleye, the laughtre men was wont to finde
  In hir, and eek hir Ioyes everychone,
  Ben fled, and thus lyth now Criseyde allone.

  125. Aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring
  Bi-trent, in sothfast tokninge of hir peyne,                          870
  That to biholde it was a dedly thing,
  For which Pandare mighte not restreyne
  The teres from his eyen for to reyne.
  But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seyde
  From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.                                875

  126. 'Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how
  The king, with othere lordes, for the beste,
  Hath mad eschaunge of Antenor and yow,
  That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
  But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,                                880
  That may non erthely mannes tonge seye;
  For verray wo his wit is al aweye.

  127. For which we han so sorwed, he and I,
  That in-to litel bothe it hadde us slawe;
  But thurgh my conseil this day, fynally,                              885
  He somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe.
  And semeth me that he desyreth fawe
  With yow to been al night, for to devyse
  Remede in this, if ther were any wyse.

  128. This, short and pleyne, theffect of my message,                  890
  As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.
  For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,
  May to no long prologe as now entende;
  And her-upon ye may answere him sende.
  And, for the love of god, my nece dere,                               895
  So leef this wo er Troilus be here.'

  129. 'Gret is my wo,' quod she, and sighte sore,
  As she that feleth dedly sharp distresse;
  'But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more,
  That love him bet than he him-self, I gesse.                          900
  Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse?
  Can he for me so pitously compleyne?
  Y-wis, this sorwe doubleth al my peyne.

  130. Grevous to me, god wot, is for to twinne,'
  Quod she, 'but yet it hardere is to me                                905
  To seen that sorwe which that he is inne;
  For wel wot I, it wol my bane be;
  And deye I wol in certayn,' tho quod she;
  'But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth,
  Dryve out that goost, which in myn herte beteth.'                     910

  131. Thise wordes seyd, she on hir armes two
  Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously.
  Quod Pandarus, 'allas! why do ye so,
  Syn wel ye wot the tyme is faste by,
  That he shal come? Arys up hastely,                                   915
  That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde,
  But ye wol han him wood out of his minde!

  132. For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere,
  He wolde him-selve slee; and if I wende
  To han this fare, he sholde not come here                             920
  For al the good that Pryam may despende.
  For to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende,
  That knowe I wel; and for-thy yet I seye,
  So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye.

  133. And shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge,                        925
  And nought encresse, leve nece swete;
  Beth rather to him cause of flat than egge,
  And with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete.
  What helpeth it to wepen ful a strete,
  Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte?                            930
  Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte.

  134. I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe,
  Sin ye ben wyse, and bothe of oon assent,
  So shapeth how distourbe your goinge,
  Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.                                  935
  Wommen ben wyse in short avysement;
  And lat sen how your wit shal now avayle;
  And what that I may helpe, it shal not fayle.'

  135. 'Go,' quod Criseyde, 'and uncle, trewely,
  I shal don al my might, me to restreyne                               940
  From weping in his sight, and bisily,
  Him for to glade, I shal don al my peyne,
  And in myn herte seken every veyne;
  If to this soor ther may be founden salve,
  It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.'                           945

  136. Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte,
  Til in a temple he fond him allone,
  As he that of his lyf no lenger roughte;
  But to the pitouse goddes everichone
  Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone,                            950
  To doon him sone out of this world to pace;
  For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.

  137. And shortly, al the sothe for to seye,
  He was so fallen in despeyr that day,
  That outrely he shoop him for to deye.                                955
  For right thus was his argument alwey:
  He seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey!
  'For al that comth, comth by necessitee;
  Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.

  138. For certaynly, this wot I wel,' he seyde,                        960
  That for-sight of divyne purveyaunce
  Hath seyn alwey me to for-gon Criseyde,
  Sin god seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,
  And hem desponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce,
  In hir merytes sothly for to be,                                      965
  As they shul comen by predestinee.

  139. But nathelees, allas! whom shal I leve?
  For ther ben grete clerkes many oon,
  That destinee thorugh argumentes preve;
  And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon;                            970
  But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.
  O, welaway! so sleye arn clerkes olde,
  That I not whos opinion I may holde.

  140. For som men seyn, if god seth al biforn,
  Ne god may not deceyved ben, pardee,                                  975
  Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn,
  That purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be.
  Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he
  Hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede,
  We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.                         980

  141. For other thought nor other dede also
  Might never be, but swich as purveyaunce,
  Which may not ben deceyved never-mo,
  Hath feled biforn, with-outen ignoraunce.
  For if ther mighte been a variaunce                                   985
  To wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge,
  Ther nere no prescience of thing cominge;

  142. But it were rather an opinioun
  Uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseinge;
  And certes, that were an abusioun,                                    990
  That god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge
  More than we men that han doutous weninge.
  But swich an errour up-on god to gesse
  Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.

  143. Eek this is an opinioun of somme                                 995
  That han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shore;
  They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come
  For that the prescience hath seyn bifore
  That it shal come; but they seyn, that therfore
  That it shal come, therfore the purveyaunce                          1000
  Wot it biforn with-outen ignoraunce;

  144. And in this manere this necessitee
  Retorneth in his part contrarie agayn.
  For needfully bihoveth it not to be
  That thilke thinges fallen in certayn                                1005
  That ben purveyed; but nedely, as they seyn,
  Bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle,
  That they in certayn ben purveyed alle.

  145. I mene as though I laboured me in this,
  To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be;                     1010
  As whether that the prescience of god is
  The certayn cause of the necessitee
  Of thinges that to comen been, pardee;
  Or if necessitee of thing cominge
  Be cause certeyn of the purveyinge.                                  1015

  146. But now ne enforce I me nat in shewinge
  How the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot I,
  That it bihoveth that the bifallinge
  Of thinges wist biforen certeynly
  Be necessarie, al seme it not ther-by                                1020
  That prescience put falling necessaire
  To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire.

  147. For if ther sit a man yond on a see,
  Than by necessitee bihoveth it
  That, certes, thyn opinioun soth be,                                 1025
  That wenest or coniectest that he sit;
  And ferther-over now ayenward yit,
  Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,
  As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie):

  148. I seye, that if the opinioun of thee                            1030
  Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this,
  That he mot sitten by necessitee;
  And thus necessitee in either is.
  For in him nede of sitting is, y-wis,
  And in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe,                       1035
  Ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe.

  149. But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,
  That thyn opinion of sitting soth is;
  But rather, for the man sit ther bifore,
  Therfore is thyn opinion sooth, y-wis.                               1040
  And I seye, though the cause of sooth of this
  Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee
  Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.

  150. Thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce,
  I may wel maken, as it semeth me,                                    1045
  My resoninge of goddes purveyaunce,
  And of the thinges that to comen be;
  By whiche reson men may wel y-see,
  That thilke thinges that in erthe falle,
  That by necessitee they comen alle.                                  1050

  151. For al-though that, for thing shal come, y-wis,
  Therfore is it purveyed, certaynly,
  Nat that it comth for it purveyed is:
  Yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully,
  That thing to come be purveyed, trewely;                             1055
  Or elles, thinges that purveyed be,
  That they bityden by necessitee.

  152. And this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn,
  For to destroye our free chois every del.--
  But now is this abusion to seyn,                                     1060
  That fallinge of the thinges temporel
  Is cause of goddes prescience eternel.
  Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,
  That thing to come sholde cause his prescience.

  153. What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought,                1065
  But that god purveyth thing that is to come
  For that it is to come, and elles nought?
  So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,
  That whylom been bifalle and over-come,
  Ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce,                            1070
  That for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce.

  154. And over al this, yet seye I more herto,
  That right as whan I woot ther is a thing,
  Y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so;
  Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,                            1075
  So mot it come; and thus the bifalling
  Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde,
  They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.'

  155. Than seyde he thus, 'almighty Iove in trone,
  That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse,                       1080
  Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone,
  Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.'
  And whyl he was in al this hevinesse,
  Disputinge with him-self in this matere,
  Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.                            1085

  156. 'O mighty god,' quod Pandarus, 'in trone,
  Ey! who seigh ever a wys man faren so?
  Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?
  Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?
  What, parde, yet is not Criseyde a-go!                               1090
  Why lust thee so thy-self for-doon for drede,
  That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede?

  157. Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn
  With-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?
  Artow for hir and for non other born?                                1095
  Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese?
  Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese.
  That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces,
  Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.

  158. And yet this is a wonder most of alle,                          1100
  Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit,
  Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,
  Ne if she can hir-self distorben it.
  Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit.
  A man may al by tyme his nekke bede                                  1105
  Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.

  159. For-thy take hede of that that I shal seye;
  I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be,
  So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.
  And ever-mo me thinketh thus, that she                               1110
  Hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee,
  Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede,
  Distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede.

  160. For which my counseil is, whan it is night,
  Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;                            1115
  And blisful Iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte,
  Shal, as I hope, hir grace un-to us sende.
  Myn herte seyth, "certeyn, she shal not wende;"
  And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste;
  And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.'                          1120

  161. This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,
  'Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so;'
  And what him liste, he seyde un-to it more.
  And whan that it was tyme for to go,
  Ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo,                                 1125
  Un-to hir com, as he was wont to done;
  And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.

  162. Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,
  So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste,
  That neither of hem other mighte grete,                              1130
  But hem in armes toke and after kiste.
  The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste
  Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe,
  As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge.

  163. Tho woful teres that they leten falle                           1135
  As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,
  For peyne, as is ligne aloës or galle.
  So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde,
  The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde.
  That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,                        1140
  That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte.

  164. But whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne
  Retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle,
  And that som-what to wayken gan the peyne
  By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle                       1145
  Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,
  With broken voys, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde
  To Troilus thise ilke wordes seyde:

  165. 'O Iove, I deye, and mercy I beseche!
  Help, Troilus!' and ther-with-al hir face                            1150
  Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche;
  Hir woful spirit from his propre place,
  Right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace.
  And thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene,
  That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene.                           1155

  166. This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,
  Clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed,
  With-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde,
  Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),
  This sorwful man can now noon other reed,                            1160
  But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste;
  Wher him was wo, god and him-self it wiste!

  167. He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde;
  For signe of lyf, for ought he can or may,
  Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde,                           1165
  For which his song ful ofte is 'weylaway!'
  But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,
  With sorwful voys, and herte of blisse al bare,
  He seyde how she was fro this world y-fare!

  168. So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned,                    1170
  His hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye,
  And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned,
  He gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye,
  And pitously gan for the soule preye,
  And seyde, 'O lord, that set art in thy trone,                       1175
  Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!'

  169. She cold was and with-outen sentement,
  For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;
  And this was him a preignant argument
  That she was forth out of this world agoon;                          1180
  And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,
  He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere
  As men don hem that shul be leyd on bere.

  170. And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,
  His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte,                       1185
  Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte,
  So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,
  Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte;
  Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,
  That in this world he lenger liven sholde.                           1190

  171. Thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn,
  'O cruel Iove, and thou, Fortune adverse,
  This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn
  Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,
  Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!                              1195
  Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;
  Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.

  172. For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus,
  Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye;
  Shal never lover seyn that Troilus                                   1200
  Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye;
  For certeyn, I wol bere hir companye.
  But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,
  Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere.

  173. And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,                      1205
  And thou, Pryam, and bretheren al y-fere,
  And thou, my moder, farewel! for I go;
  And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!
  And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,
  Receyve now my spirit!' wolde he seye,                               1210
  With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye.

  174. But as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde,
  And gan to syke, and 'Troilus' she cryde;
  And he answerde, 'lady myn Criseyde,
  Live ye yet?' and leet his swerd doun glyde.                         1215
  'Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupyde!'
  Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte;
  And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte;

  175. Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,
  And hir to glade he dide al his entente;                             1220
  For which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte,
  In-to hir woful herte ayein it wente.
  But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente
  A-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye,
  As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye,                               1225

  176. And asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe?
  And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,
  And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.
  For which Criseyde up-on him gan biholde,
  And gan him in hir armes faste folde,                                1230
  And seyde, 'O mercy, god, lo, which a dede!
  Allas! how neigh we were bothe dede!

  177. Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,
  Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?' quod she.
  'Ye, douteless;' and she answerde, 'allas!                           1235
  For, by that ilke lord that made me,
  I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be,
  After your deeth, to han be crowned quene
  Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene.

  178. But with this selve swerd, which that here is,                  1240
  My-selve I wolde have slayn!'--quod she tho;
  'But ho, for we han right y-now of this,
  And late us ryse and streight to bedde go;
  And therë lat vs speken of our wo.
  For, by the morter which that I see brenne,                          1245
  Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.'

  179. Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,
  Nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn;
  For pitously ech other gan biholde,
  As they that hadden al hir blisse y-lorn,                            1250
  Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born.
  Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde
  To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde:--

  180. 'Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,' quod she,
  'That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne,                             1255
  And seketh nought how holpen for to be,
  It nis but folye and encrees of peyne;
  And sin that here assembled be we tweyne
  To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,
  It were al tyme sone to biginne.                                     1260

  181. I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,
  And as I am avysed sodeynly,
  So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot.
  Me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor I
  Oughte half this wo to make skilfully.                               1265
  For there is art y-now for to redresse
  That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.

  182. Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne,
  For ought I woot, for no-thing elles is
  But for the cause that we sholden twinne.                            1270
  Considered al, ther nis no-more amis.
  But what is thanne a remede un-to this,
  But that we shape us sone for to mete?
  This al and som, my dere herte swete.

  183. Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute                           1275
  To come ayein, sone after that I go,
  Ther-of am I no maner thing in doute.
  For dredeles, with-inne a wouke or two,
  I shal ben here; and, that it may be so
  By alle right, and in a wordes fewe,                                 1280
  I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe.

  184. For which I wol not make long sermoun,
  For tyme y-lost may not recovered be;
  But I wol gon to my conclusioun,
  And to the beste, in ought that I can see.                           1285
  And, for the love of god, for-yeve it me
  If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste;
  For trewely, I speke it for the beste;

  185. Makinge alwey a protestacioun,
  That now these wordes, whiche that I shal seye,                      1290
  Nis but to shewe yow my mocioun,
  To finde un-to our helpe the beste weye;
  And taketh it non other wyse, I preye.
  For in effect what-so ye me comaunde,
  That wol I doon, for that is no demaunde.                            1295

  186. Now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde,
  My goinge graunted is by parlement
  So ferforth, that it may not be with-stonde
  For al this world, as by my Iugement.
  And sin ther helpeth noon avysement                                  1300
  To letten it, lat it passe out of minde;
  And lat us shape a bettre wey to finde.

  187. The sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne
  Wol us disese and cruelliche anoye.
  But him bihoveth som-tyme han a peyne,                               1305
  That serveth love, if that he wol have Ioye.
  And sin I shal no ferthere out of Troye
  Than I may ryde ayein on half a morwe,
  It oughte lasse causen us to sorwe.

  188. So as I shal not so ben hid in muwe,                            1310
  That day by day, myn owene herte dere,
  Sin wel ye woot that it is now a truwe,
  Ye shul ful wel al myn estat y-here.
  And er that truwe is doon, I shal ben here,
  And thanne have ye bothe Antenor y-wonne                             1315
  And me also; beth glad now, if ye conne;

  189. And thenk right thus, "Criseyde is now agoon,
  But what! she shal come hastely ayeyn;"
  And whanne, allas? by god, lo, right anoon,
  Er dayes ten, this dar I saufly seyn.                                1320
  And thanne at erste shul we been so fayn,
  So as we shulle to-gederes ever dwelle,
  Thal al this world ne mighte our blisse telle.

  190. I see that ofte, ther-as we ben now,
  That for the beste, our conseil for to hyde,                         1325
  Ye speke not with me, nor I with yow
  In fourtenight; ne see yow go ne ryde.
  May ye not ten dayes thanne abyde,
  For myn honour, in swich an aventure?
  Y-wis, ye mowen elles lite endure!                                   1330

  191. Ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here,
  But-if that onliche it my fader be;
  And eek myn othere thinges alle y-fere,
  And nameliche, my dere herte, ye,
  Whom that I nolde leven for to see                                   1335
  For al this world, as wyd as it hath space;
  Or elles, see ich never Ioves face!

  192. Why trowe ye my fader in this wyse
  Coveiteth so to see me, but for drede
  Lest in this toun that folkes me dispyse                             1340
  By-cause of him, for his unhappy dede?
  What woot my fader what lyf that I lede?
  For if he wiste in Troye how wel I fare,
  Us neded for my wending nought to care.

  193. Ye seen that every day eek, more and more,                      1345
  Men trete of pees; and it supposed is,
  That men the quene Eleyne shal restore,
  And Grekes us restore that is mis.
  So though ther nere comfort noon but this,
  That men purposen pees on every syde,                                1350
  Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde.

  194. For if that it be pees, myn herte dere,
  The nature of the pees mot nedes dryve
  That men moste entrecomunen y-fere,
  And to and fro eek ryde and gon as blyve                             1355
  Alday as thikke as been flen from an hyve;
  And every wight han libertee to bleve
  Wher-as him list the bet, with-outen leve.

  195. And though so be that pees ther may be noon,
  Yet hider, though ther never pees ne were,                           1360
  I moste come; for whider sholde I goon,
  Or how mischaunce sholde I dwelle there
  Among tho men of armes ever in fere?
  For which, as wisly god my soule rede,
  I can not seen wher-of ye sholden drede.                             1365

  196. Have here another wey, if it so be
  That al this thing ne may yow not suffyse.
  My fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee,
  Is old, and elde is ful of coveityse.
  And I right now have founden al the gyse,                            1370
  With-oute net, wher-with I shal him hente;
  And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente.

  197. Lo, Troilus, men seyn that hard it is
  The wolf ful, and the wether hool to have;
  This is to seyn, that men ful ofte, y-wis,                           1375
  Mot spenden part, the remenaunt for to save.
  For ay with gold men may the herte grave
  Of him that set is up-on coveityse;
  And how I mene, I shal it yow devyse.

  198. The moeble which that I have in this toun                       1380
  Un-to my fader shal I take, and seye,
  That right for trust and for savacioun
  It sent is from a freend of his or tweye,
  The whiche freendes ferventliche him preye
  To senden after more, and that in hye,                               1385
  Whyl that this toun stant thus in Iupartye.

  199. And that shal been an huge quantitee,
  Thus shal I seyn, but, lest it folk aspyde,
  This may be sent by no wight but by me;
  I shal eek shewen him, if pees bityde,                               1390
  What frendes that ich have on every syde
  Toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace
  Of Priamus, and doon him stonde in grace.

  200. So, what for o thing and for other, swete,
  I shal him so enchaunten with my sawes,                              1395
  That right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete!
  For al Appollo, or his clerkes lawes,
  Or calculinge avayleth nought three hawes;
  Desyr of gold shal so his sowle blende,
  That, as me lyst, I shal wel make an ende.                           1400

  201. And if he wolde ought by his sort it preve
  If that I lye, in certayn I shal fonde
  Distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve,
  Makinge his sort, and beren him on honde,
  He hath not wel the goddes understonde.                              1405
  For goddes speken in amphibologyes,
  And, for a sooth, they tellen twenty lyes.

  202. Eek drede fond first goddes, I suppose,
  Thus shal I seyn, and that his cowarde herte
  Made him amis the goddes text to glose,                              1410
  Whan he for ferde out of his Delphos sterte.
  And but I make him sone to converte,
  And doon my reed with-inne a day or tweye,
  I wol to yow oblige me to deye.'

  203. And treweliche, as writen wel I finde,                          1415
  That al this thing was seyd of good entente;
  And that hir herte trewe was and kinde
  Towardes him, and spak right as she mente,
  And that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente,
  And was in purpos ever to be trewe;                                  1420
  Thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe.

  204. This Troilus, with herte and eres spradde,
  Herde al this thing devysen to and fro;
  And verraylich him semed that he hadde
  The selve wit; but yet to lete hir go                                1425
  His herte misforyaf him ever-mo.
  But fynally, he gan his herte wreste
  To trusten hir, and took it for the beste.

  205. For which the grete furie of his penaunce
  Was queynt with hope, and ther-with hem bitwene                      1430
  Bigan for Ioye the amorouse daunce.
  And as the briddes, whan the sonne is shene,
  Delyten in hir song in leves grene,
  Right so the wordes that they spake y-fere
  Delyted hem, and made hir hertes clere.                              1435

  206. But natheles, the wending of Criseyde,
  For al this world, may nought out of his minde;
  For which ful ofte he pitously hir preyde,
  That of hir heste he might hir trewe finde.
  And seyde hir, 'certes, if ye be unkinde,                            1440
  And but ye come at day set in-to Troye,
  Ne shal I never have hele, honour, ne Ioye.

  207. For al-so sooth as sonne up-rist on morwe,
  And, god! so wisly thou me, woful wrecche,
  To reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe,                             1445
  I wol my-selven slee if that ye drecche.
  But of my deeth though litel be to recche,
  Yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte,
  Dwel rather here, myn owene swete herte!

  208. For trewely, myn owene lady dere,                               1450
  Tho sleightes yet that I have herd yow stere
  Ful shaply been to failen alle y-fere.
  For thus men seyn, "that oon thenketh the bere,
  But al another thenketh his ledere."
  Your sire is wys, and seyd is, out of drede,                         1455
  "Men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede."

  209. It is ful hard to halten unespyed
  Bifore a crepul, for he can the craft;
  Your fader is in sleighte as Argus yëd;
  For al be that his moeble is him biraft,                             1460
  His olde sleighte is yet so with him laft,
  Ye shal not blende him for your womanhede,
  Ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede.

  210. I noot if pees shal ever-mo bityde;
  But, pees or no, for ernest ne for game,                             1465
  I woot, sin Calkas on the Grekes syde
  Hath ones been, and lost so foule his name,
  He dar no more come here ayein for shame;
  For which that weye, for ought I can espye,
  To trusten on, nis but a fantasye.                                   1470

  211. Ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose
  To been a wyf, and as he can wel preche,
  He shal som Grek so preyse and wel alose,
  That ravisshen he shal yow with his speche,
  Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche.                            1475
  And Troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe,
  Shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe!

  212. And over al this, your fader shal despyse
  Us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn;
  And that thassege never shal aryse,                                  1480
  For-why the Grekes han it alle sworn
  Til we be slayn, and doun our walles torn.
  And thus he shal you with his wordes fere,
  That ay drede I, that ye wol bleve there.

  213. Ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight                         1485
  A-mong the Grekes, ful of worthinesse,
  And eche of hem with herte, wit, and might
  To plesen yow don al his besinesse,
  That ye shul dullen of the rudenesse
  Of us sely Troianes, but-if routhe                                   1490
  Remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe.

  214. And this to me so grevous is to thinke,
  That fro my brest it wol my soule rende;
  Ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke
  A good opinioun, if that ye wende;                                   1495
  For-why your faderes sleighte wol us shende.
  And if ye goon, as I have told yow yore,
  So thenk I nam but deed, with-oute more.

  215. For which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte,
  A thousand tymes mercy I yow preye;                                  1500
  So reweth on myn aspre peynes smerte,
  And doth somwhat, as that I shal yow seye,
  And lat us stele away bitwixe us tweye;
  And thenk that folye is, whan man may chese,
  For accident his substaunce ay to lese.                              1505

  216. I mene this, that sin we mowe er day
  Wel stele away, and been to-gider so,
  What wit were it to putten in assay,
  In cas ye sholden to your fader go,
  If that ye mighte come ayein or no?                                  1510
  Thus mene I, that it were a gret folye
  To putte that sikernesse in Iupartye.

  217. And vulgarly to speken of substaunce
  Of tresour, may we bothe with us lede
  Y-nough to live in honour and plesaunce,                             1515
  Til in-to tyme that we shul ben dede;
  And thus we may eschewen al this drede.
  For everich other wey ye can recorde,
  Myn herte, y-wis, may not ther-with acorde.

  218. And hardily, ne dredeth no poverte,                             1520
  For I have kin and freendes elles-where
  That, though we comen in our bare sherte,
  Us sholde neither lakke gold ne gere,
  But been honoured whyl we dwelten there.
  And go we anoon, for, as in myn entente,                             1525
  This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.'

  219. Criseyde, with a syk, right in this wyse
  Answerde, 'y-wis, my dere herte trewe,
  We may wel stele away, as ye devyse,
  And finde swiche unthrifty weyes newe;                               1530
  But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe.
  And help me god so at my moste nede
  As causeles ye suffren al this drede!

  220. For thilke day that I for cherisshinge
  Or drede of fader, or of other wight,                                1535
  Or for estat, delyt, or for weddinge
  Be fals to yow, my Troilus, my knight,
  Saturnes doughter, Iuno, thorugh hir might,
  As wood as Athamante do me dwelle
  Eternaly in Stix, the put of helle!                                  1540

  221. And this on every god celestial
  I swere it yow, and eek on eche goddesse,
  On every Nymphe and deite infernal,
  On Satiry and Fauny more and lesse,
  That halve goddes been of wildernesse;                               1545
  And Attropos my threed of lyf to-breste
  If I be fals; now trowe me if thow leste!

  222. And thou, Simoys, that as an arwe clere
  Thorugh Troye rennest ay downward to the see,
  Ber witnesse of this word that seyd is here,                         1550
  That thilke day that ich untrewe be
  To Troilus, myn owene herte free,
  That thou retorne bakwarde to thy welle,
  And I with body and soule sinke in helle!

  223. But that ye speke, awey thus for to go                          1555
  And leten alle your freendes, god for-bede,
  For any womman, that ye sholden so,
  And namely, sin Troye hath now swich nede
  Of help; and eek of o thing taketh hede,
  If this were wist, my lif laye in balaunce,                          1560
  And your honour; god shilde us fro mischaunce!

  224. And if so be that pees her-after take,
  As alday happeth, after anger, game,
  Why, lord! the sorwe and wo ye wolden make,
  That ye ne dorste come ayein for shame!                              1565
  And er that ye Iuparten so your name,
  Beth nought to hasty in this hote fare;
  For hasty man ne wanteth never care.

  225. What trowe ye the peple eek al aboute
  Wolde of it seye? It is ful light to arede.                          1570
  They wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute,
  That love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede,
  But lust voluptuous and coward drede.
  Thus were al lost, y-wis, myn herte dere,
  Your honour, which that now shyneth so clere.                        1575

  226. And also thenketh on myn honestee,
  That floureth yet, how foule I sholde it shende,
  And with what filthe it spotted sholde be,
  If in this forme I sholde with yow wende.
  Ne though I livede un-to the worldes ende,                           1580
  My name sholde I never ayeinward winne;
  Thus were I lost, and that were routhe and sinne.

  227. And for-thy slee with reson al this hete;
  Men seyn, "the suffraunt overcometh," pardee;
  Eek "who-so wol han leef, he leef mot lete;"                         1585
  Thus maketh vertue of necessitee
  By pacience, and thenk that lord is he
  Of fortune ay, that nought wol of hir recche;
  And she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche.

  228. And trusteth this, that certes, herte swete,                    1590
  Er Phebus suster, Lucina the shene,
  The Leoun passe out of this Ariete,
  I wol ben here, with-outen any wene.
  I mene, as helpe me Iuno, hevenes quene,
  The tenthe day, but-if that deeth me assayle,                        1595
  I wol yow seen, with-outen any fayle.'

  229. 'And now, so this be sooth,' quod Troilus,
  'I shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day,
  Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus.
  But, for the love of god, if it be may,                              1600
  So lat us stele prively away;
  For ever in oon, as for to live in reste,
  Myn herte seyth that it wol been the beste.'

  230. 'O mercy, god, what lyf is this?' quod she;
  'Allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene!                             1605
  I see wel now that ye mistrusten me;
  For by your wordes it is wel y-sene.
  Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene,
  Mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe;
  Sin to be trewe I have yow plight my trouthe.                        1610

  231. And thenketh wel, that som tyme it is wit
  To spende a tyme, a tyme for to winne;
  Ne, pardee, lorn am I nought fro yow yit,
  Though that we been a day or two a-twinne.
  Dryf out the fantasyes yow with-inne;                                1615
  And trusteth me, and leveth eek your sorwe,
  Or here my trouthe, I wol not live til morwe.

  232. For if ye wiste how sore it doth me smerte,
  Ye wolde cesse of this; for god, thou wost,
  The pure spirit wepeth in myn herte,                                 1620
  To see yow wepen that I love most,
  And that I moot gon to the Grekes ost.
  Ye, nere it that I wiste remedye
  To come ayein, right here I wolde dye!

  233. But certes, I am not so nyce a wight                            1625
  That I ne can imaginen a way
  To come ayein that day that I have hight.
  For who may holde thing that wol a-way?
  My fader nought, for al his queynte pley.
  And by my thrift, my wending out of Troye                            1630
  Another day shal torne us alle to Ioye.

  234. For-thy, with al myn herte I yow beseke,
  If that yow list don ought for my preyere,
  And for the love which that I love yow eke,
  That er that I departe fro yow here,                                 1635
  That of so good a comfort and a chere
  I may you seen, that ye may bringe at reste
  Myn herte, which that is at point to breste.

  235. And over al this, I pray yow,' quod she tho,
  'Myn owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce,                             1640
  Sin I am thyn al hool, with-outen mo,
  That whyl that I am absent, no plesaunce
  Of othere do me fro your remembraunce.
  For I am ever a-gast, for-why men rede,
  That "love is thing ay ful of bisy drede."                           1645

  236. For in this world ther liveth lady noon,
  If that ye were untrewe, as god defende!
  That so bitraysed were or wo bigoon
  As I, that alle trouthe in yow entende.
  And douteles, if that ich other wende,                               1650
  I nere but deed; and er ye cause finde,
  For goddes love, so beth me not unkinde.'

  237. To this answerde Troilus and seyde,
  'Now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye,
  Me glade, as wis I never un-to Criseyde,                             1655
  Sin thilke day I saw hir first with yë,
  Was fals, ne never shal til that I dye.
  At shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve;
  I can no more, it shal be founde at preve.'

  238. 'Graunt mercy, goode myn, y-wis,' quod she,                     1660
  'And blisful Venus lat me never sterve
  Er I may stonde of plesaunce in degree
  To quyte him wel, that so wel can deserve;
  And whyl that god my wit wol me conserve,
  I shal so doon, so trewe I have yow founde,                          1665
  That ay honour to me-ward shal rebounde.

  239. For trusteth wel, that your estat royal
  Ne veyn delyt, nor only worthinesse
  Of yow in werre, or torney marcial,
  Ne pompe, array, nobley, or eek richesse,                            1670
  Ne made me to rewe on your distresse;
  But moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe,
  That was the cause I first hadde on yow routhe!

  240. Eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde,
  And that ye hadde, as me thoughte, in despyt                         1675
  Every thing that souned in-to badde,
  As rudenesse and poeplish appetyt;
  And that your reson brydled your delyt,
  This made, aboven every creature,
  That I was your, and shal, whyl I may dure.                          1680

  241. And this may lengthe of yeres not for-do,
  Ne remuable fortune deface;
  But Iuppiter, that of his might may do
  The sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace,
  Er nightes ten, to meten in this place,                              1685
  So that it may your herte and myn suffyse;
  And fareth now wel, for tyme is that ye ryse.'

  242. And after that they longe y-pleyned hadde,
  And ofte y-kist and streite in armes folde,
  The day gan ryse, and Troilus him cladde,                            1690
  And rewfulliche his lady gan biholde,
  As he that felte dethes cares colde.
  And to hir grace he gan him recomaunde;
  Wher him was wo, this holde I no demaunde.

  243. For mannes heed imaginen ne can,                                1695
  Ne entendement considere, ne tonge telle
  The cruel peynes of this sorwful man,
  That passen every torment doun in helle.
  For whan he saugh that she ne mighte dwelle,
  Which that his soule out of his herte rente,                         1700
  With-outen more, out of the chaumbre he wente.

BOOK V.

INCIPIT LIBER QUINTUS.

  1. Aprochen gan the fatal destinee
  That Ioves hath in disposicioun,
  And to yow, angry Parcas, sustren three,
  Committeth, to don execucioun;
  For which Criseyde moste out of the toun,                               5
  And Troilus shal dwelle forth in pyne
  Til Lachesis his threed no lenger twyne.--

  2. The golden-tressed. Phebus heighe on-lofte
  Thryës hadde alle with his bemes shene
  The snowes molte, and Zephirus as ofte                                 10
  Y-brought ayein the tendre leves grene,
  Sin that the sone of Ecuba the quene
  Bigan to love hir first, for whom his sorwe
  Was al, that she departe sholde a-morwe.

  3. Ful redy was at pryme Dyomede,                                      15
  Criseyde un-to the Grekes ost to lede,
  For sorwe of which she felte hir herte blede,
  As she that niste what was best to rede.
  And trewely, as men in bokes rede,
  Men wiste never womman han the care,                                   20
  Ne was so looth out of a toun to fare.

  4. This Troilus, with-outen reed or lore,
  As man that hath his Ioyes eek forlore,
  Was waytinge on his lady ever-more
  As she that was the soothfast crop and more                            25
  Of al his lust, or Ioyes here-tofore.
  But Troilus, now farewel al thy Ioye,
  For shaltow never seen hir eft in Troye!

  5. Soth is, that whyl he bood in this manere,
  He gan his wo ful manly for to hyde,                                   30
  That wel unnethe it seen was in his chere;
  But at the yate ther she sholde oute ryde
  With certeyn folk, he hoved hir tabyde,
  So wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleyne,
  That on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne.                             35

  6. For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe,
  Whan Diomede on horse gan him dresse,
  And seyde un-to him-self this ilke sawe,
  'Allas,' quod he, 'thus foul a wrecchednesse
  Why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse?                            40
  Were it not bet at ones for to dye
  Than ever-more in langour thus to drye?

  7. Why nil I make at ones riche and pore
  To have y-nough to done, er that she go?
  Why nil I bringe al Troye upon a rore?                                 45
  Why nil I sleen this Diomede also?
  Why nil I rather with a man or two
  Stele hir a-way? Why wol I this endure?
  Why nil I helpen to myn owene cure?'

  8. But why he nolde doon so fel a dede,                                50
  That shal I seyn, and why him liste it spare:
  He hadde in herte alwey a maner drede,
  Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare,
  Sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his care.
  And elles, certeyn, as I seyde yore,                                   55
  He hadde it doon, with-outen wordes more.

  9. Criseyde, whan she redy was to ryde,
  Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde 'allas!'
  But forth she moot, for ought that may bityde,
  And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas.                                 60
  Ther nis non other remedie in this cas.
  What wonder is though that hir sore smerte,
  Whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte?

  10. This Troilus, in wyse of curteisye,
  With hauke on hond, and with an huge route                             65
  Of knightes, rood and dide hir companye,
  Passinge al the valey fer with-oute.
  And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute,
  Ful fayn, and wo was him to goon so sone;
  But torne he moste, and it was eek to done.                            70

  11. And right with that was Antenor y-come
  Out of the Grekes ost, and every wight
  Was of it glad, and seyde he was wel-come.
  And Troilus, al nere his herte light,
  He peyned him with al his fulle might                                  75
  Him to with-holde of wepinge at the leste,
  And Antenor he kiste, and made feste.

  12. And ther-with-al he moste his leve take,
  And caste his eye upon hir pitously,
  And neer he rood, his cause for to make,                               80
  To take hir by the honde al sobrely.
  And lord! so she gan wepen tendrely!
  And he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seye,
  'Now hold your day, and dooth me not to deye.'

  13. With that his courser torned he a-boute                            85
  With face pale, and un-to Diomede
  No word he spak, ne noon of al his route;
  Of which the sone of Tydeus took hede,
  As he that coude more than the crede
  In swich a craft, and by the reyne hir hente;                          90
  And Troilus to Troye homwarde he wente.

  14. This Diomede, that ladde hir by the brydel,
  Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye,
  Thoughte, 'al my labour shal not been on ydel,
  If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye.                                95
  For at the worste it may yet shorte our weye.
  I have herd seyd, eek tymes twyës twelve,
  "He is a fool that wol for-yete him-selve."'

  15. But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough,
  'That certaynly I am aboute nought                                    100
  If that I speke of love, or make it tough;
  For douteles, if she have in hir thought
  Him that I gesse, he may not been y-brought
  So sone awey; but I shal finde a mene,
  That she not wite as yet shal what I mene.'                           105

  16. This Diomede, as he that coude his good,
  Whan this was doon, gan fallen forth in speche
  Of this and that, and asked why she stood
  In swich disese, and gan hir eek biseche,
  That if that he encrese mighte or eche                                110
  With any thing hir ese, that she sholde
  Comaunde it him, and seyde he doon it wolde.

  17. For trewely he swoor hir, as a knight,
  That ther nas thing with whiche he mighte hir plese,
  That he nolde doon his peyne and al his might                         115
  To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese.
  And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese,
  And seyde, 'y-wis, we Grekes con have Ioye
  To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.'

  18. He seyde eek thus, 'I woot, yow thinketh straunge,                120
  No wonder is, for it is to yow newe,
  Thaqueintaunce of these Troianes to chaunge,
  For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe.
  But wolde never god but-if as trewe
  A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde                                 125
  As any Troian is, and eek as kinde.

  19. And by the cause I swoor yow right, lo, now,
  To been your freend, and helply, to my might,
  And for that more acqueintaunce eek of yow
  Have ich had than another straunger wight,                            130
  So fro this forth I pray yow, day and night,
  Comaundeth me, how sore that me smerte,
  To doon al that may lyke un-to your herte;

  20. And that ye me wolde as your brother trete,
  And taketh not my frendship in despyt;                                135
  And though your sorwes be for thinges grete,
  Noot I not why, but out of more respyt,
  Myn herte hath for to amende it greet delyt.
  And if I may your harmes not redresse,
  I am right sory for your hevinesse.                                   140

  21. And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe
  Han many a day be, alwey yet, pardee,
  O god of love in sooth we serven bothe.
  And, for the love of god, my lady free,
  Whom so ye hate, as beth not wroth with me.                           145
  For trewely, ther can no wight yow serve,
  That half so looth your wraththe wolde deserve.

  22. And nere it that we been so neigh the tente
  Of Calkas, which that seen us bothe may,
  I wolde of this yow telle al myn entente;                             150
  But this enseled til another day.
  Yeve me your hond, I am, and shal ben ay,
  God help me so, whyl that my lyf may dure,
  Your owene aboven every creature.

  23. Thus seyde I never er now to womman born;                         155
  For god myn herte as wisly glade so,
  I lovede never womman here-biforn
  As paramours ne never shal no mo.
  And, for the love of god, beth not my fo;
  Al can I not to yow, my lady dere,                                    160
  Compleyne aright, for I am yet to lere.

  24. And wondreth not, myn owene lady bright,
  Though that I speke of love to you thus blyve;
  For I have herd or this of many a wight,
  Hath loved thing he never saugh his lyve.                             165
  Eek I am not of power for to stryve
  Ayens the god of love, but him obeye
  I wol alwey, and mercy I yow preye.

  25. Ther been so worthy knightes in this place,
  And ye so fair, that everich of hem alle                              170
  Wol peynen him to stonden in your grace.
  But mighte me so fair a grace falle,
  That ye me for your servaunt wolde calle,
  So lowly ne so trewely you serve
  Nil noon of hem, as I shal, til I sterve.'                            175

  26. Criseide un-to that purpos lyte answerde,
  As she that was with sorwe oppressed so
  That, in effect, she nought his tales herde,
  But here and there, now here a word or two.
  Hir thoughte hir sorwful herte brast a-two.                           180
  For whan she gan hir fader fer aspye,
  Wel neigh doun of hir hors she gan to sye.

  27. But natheles she thonked Diomede
  Of al his travaile, and his goode chere,
  And that him liste his friendship hir to bede;                        185
  And she accepteth it in good manere,
  And wolde do fayn that is him leef and dere;
  And trusten him she wolde, and wel she mighte,
  As seyde she, and from hir hors she alighte.

  28. Hir fader hath hir in his armes nome,                             190
  And tweynty tyme he kiste his doughter swete,
  And seyde, 'O dere doughter myn, wel-come!'
  She seyde eek, she was fayn with him to mete,
  And stood forth mewet, mildë, and mansuete.
  But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle,                            195
  And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle.

  29. To Troye is come this woful Troilus,
  In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte,
  With felon look, and face dispitous.
  Tho sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte,                            200
  And thorugh his paleys, with a swollen herte,
  To chambre he wente; of no-thing took he hede,
  Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede.

  30. And there his sorwes that he spared hadde
  He yaf an issue large, and 'deeth!' he cryde;                         205
  And in his throwes frenetyk and madde
  He cursed Iove, Appollo, and eek Cupyde,
  He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipryde,
  His burthe, him-self, his fate, and eek nature,
  And, save his lady, every creature.                                   210

  31. To bedde he goth, and weyleth there and torneth
  In furie, as dooth he, Ixion, in helle;
  And in this wyse he neigh til day soiorneth.
  But tho bigan his herte a lyte unswelle
  Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle;                          215
  And pitously he cryde up-on Criseyde,
  And to him-self right thus he spak, and seyde:--

  32. 'Wher is myn owene lady lief and dere,
  Wher is hir whyte brest, wher is it, where?
  Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen clere,                                220
  That yesternight this tyme with me were?
  Now may I wepe allone many a tere,
  And graspe aboute I may, but in this place,
  Save a pilowe, I finde nought tenbrace.

  33. How shal I do? Whan shal she com ayeyn?                           225
  I noot, allas! why leet ich hir to go?
  As wolde god, ich hadde as tho be sleyn!
  O herte myn, Criseyde, O swete fo!
  O lady myn, that I love and no mo!
  To whom for ever-mo myn herte I dowe;                                 230
  See how I deye, ye nil me not rescowe!

  34. Who seeth yow now, my righte lode-sterre?
  Who sit right now or stant in your presence?
  Who can conforten now your hertes werre?
  Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience?                                  235
  Who speketh for me right now in myn absence?
  Allas, no wight; and that is al my care;
  For wel wot I, as yvel as I ye fare.

  35. How shulde I thus ten dayes ful endure,
  Whan I the firste night have al this tene?                            240
  How shal she doon eek, sorwful creature?
  For tendernesse, how shal she this sustene,
  Swich wo for me? O pitous, pale, and grene
  Shal been your fresshe wommanliche face
  For langour, er ye torne un-to this place.'                           245

  36. And whan he fil in any slomeringes,
  Anoon biginne he sholde for to grone,
  And dremen of the dredfulleste thinges
  That mighte been; as, mete he were allone
  In place horrible, makinge ay his mone,                               250
  Or meten that he was amonges alle
  His enemys, and in hir hondes falle.

  37. And ther-with-al his body sholde sterte,
  And with the stert al sodeinliche awake,
  And swich a tremour fele aboute his herte,                            255
  That of the feer his body sholde quake;
  And there-with-al he sholde a noyse make,
  And seme as though he sholde falle depe
  From heighe a-lofte; and than he wolde wepe,

  38. And rewen on him-self so pitously,                                260
  That wonder was to here his fantasye.
  Another tyme he sholde mightily
  Conforte him-self, and seyn it was folye,
  So causeles swich drede for to drye,
  And eft biginne his aspre sorwes newe,                                265
  That every man mighte on his sorwes rewe.

  39. Who coude telle aright or ful discryve
  His wo, his pleynte, his langour, and his pyne?
  Nought al the men that han or been on-lyve.
  Thou, redere, mayst thy-self ful wel devyne                           270
  That swich a wo my wit can not defyne.
  On ydel for to wryte it sholde I swinke,
  Whan that my wit is wery it to thinke.

  40. On hevene yet the sterres were sene,
  Al-though ful pale y-waxen was the mone;                              275
  And whyten gan the orisonte shene
  Al estward, as it woned is to done.
  And Phebus with his rosy carte sone
  Gan after that to dresse him up to fare,
  Whan Troilus hath sent after Pandare.                                 280

  41. This Pandare, that of al the day biforn
  Ne mighte have comen Troilus to see,
  Al-though he on his heed it hadde y-sworn,
  For with the king Pryam alday was he,
  So that it lay not in his libertee                                    285
  No-wher to gon, but on the morwe he wente
  To Troilus, whan that he for him sente.

  42. For in his herte he coude wel devyne,
  That Troilus al night for sorwe wook;
  And that he wolde telle him of his pyne,                              290
  This knew he wel y-nough, with-oute book.
  For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took,
  And Troilus tho sobreliche he grette,
  And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette.

  43. 'My Pandarus,' quod Troilus, 'the sorwe                           295
  Which that I drye, I may not longe endure.
  I trowe I shal not liven til to-morwe;
  For whiche I wolde alwey, on aventure,
  To thee devysen of my sepulture
  The forme, and of my moeble thou dispone                              300
  Right as thee semeth best is for to done.

  44. But of the fyr and flaumbe funeral
  In whiche my body brenne shal to glede,
  And of the feste and pleyes palestral
  At my vigile, I pray thee take good hede                              305
  That al be wel; and offre Mars my stede,
  My swerd, myn helm, and, leve brother dere,
  My sheld to Pallas yef, that shyneth clere.

  45. The poudre in which myn herte y-brend shal torne,
  That preye I thee thou take and it conserve                           310
  In a vessel, that men clepeth an urne,
  Of gold, and to my lady that I serve,
  For love of whom thus pitously I sterve,
  So yeve it hir, and do me this plesaunce,
  To preye hir kepe it for a remembraunce.                              315

  46. For wel I fele, by my maladye,
  And by my dremes now and yore ago,
  Al certeinly, that I mot nedes dye.
  The owle eek, which that hight Ascaphilo,
  Hath after me shright alle thise nightes two.                         320
  And, god Mercurie! of me now, woful wrecche,
  The soule gyde, and, whan thee list, it fecche!'

  47. Pandare answerde, and seyde, 'Troilus,
  My dere freend, as I have told thee yore,
  That it is folye for to sorwen thus,                                  325
  And causeles, for whiche I can no-more.
  But who-so wol not trowen reed ne lore,
  I can not seen in him no remedye,
  But lete him worthen with his fantasye.

  48. But Troilus, I pray thee tel me now,                              330
  If that thou trowe, er this, that any wight
  Hath loved paramours as wel as thou?
  Ye, god wot, and fro many a worthy knight
  Hath his lady goon a fourtenight,
  And he not yet made halvendel the fare.                               335
  What nede is thee to maken al this care?

  49. Sin day by day thou mayst thy-selven see
  That from his love, or elles from his wyf,
  A man mot twinnen of necessitee,
  Ye, though he love hir as his owene lyf;                              340
  Yet nil he with him-self thus maken stryf.
  For wel thow wost, my leve brother dere,
  That alwey freendes may nought been y-fere.

  50. How doon this folk that seen hir loves wedded
  By freendes might, as it bi-tit ful ofte,                             345
  And seen hem in hir spouses bed y-bedded?
  God woot, they take it wysly, faire and softe.
  For-why good hope halt up hir herte on-lofte,
  And for they can a tyme of sorwe endure;
  As tyme hem hurt, a tyme doth hem cure.                               350

  51. So sholdestow endure, and late slyde
  The tyme, and fonde to ben glad and light.
  Ten dayes nis so longe not tabyde.
  And sin she thee to comen hath bihight,
  She nil hir hestes breken for no wight.                               355
  For dred thee not that she nil finden weye
  To come ayein, my lyf that dorste I leye.

  52. Thy swevenes eek and al swich fantasye
  Dryf out, and lat hem faren to mischaunce;
  For they procede of thy malencolye,                                   360
  That doth thee fele in sleep al this penaunce.
  A straw for alle swevenes signifiaunce!
  God helpe me so, I counte hem not a bene,
  Ther woot no man aright what dremes mene.

  53. For prestes of the temple tellen this,                            365
  That dremes been the revelaciouns
  Of goddes, and as wel they telle, y-wis,
  That they ben infernals illusiouns;
  And leches seyn, that of complexiouns
  Proceden they, or fast, or glotonye.                                  370
  Who woot in sooth thus what they signifye?

  54. Eek othere seyn that thorugh impressiouns,
  As if a wight hath faste a thing in minde,
  That ther-of cometh swiche avisiouns;
  And othere seyn, as they in bokes finde,                              375
  That, after tymes of the yeer by kinde,
  Men dreme, and that theffect goth by the mone;
  But leve no dreem, for it is nought to done.

  55. Wel worth of dremes ay thise olde wyves,
  And treweliche eek augurie of thise foules;                           380
  For fere of which men wenen lese her lyves,
  As ravenes qualm, or shryking of thise oules.
  To trowen on it bothe fals and foul is.
  Allas, allas, so noble a creature
  As is a man, shal drede swich ordure!                                 385

  56. For which with al myn herte I thee beseche,
  Un-to thy-self that al this thou foryive;
  And rys up now with-oute more speche,
  And lat us caste how forth may best be drive
  This tyme, and eek how freshly we may live                            390
  Whan that she cometh, the which shal be right sone;
  God help me so, the beste is thus to done.

  57. Rys, lat us speke of lusty lyf in Troye
  That we han lad, and forth the tyme dryve;
  And eek of tyme cominge us reioye,                                    395
  That bringen shal our blisse now so blyve;
  And langour of these twyës dayes fyve
  We shal ther-with so foryete or oppresse,
  That wel unnethe it doon shal us duresse.

  58. This toun is ful of lordes al aboute,                             400
  And trewes lasten al this mene whyle.
  Go we pleye us in som lusty route
  To Sarpedon, not hennes but a myle.
  And thus thou shalt the tyme wel bigyle,
  And dryve it forth un-to that blisful morwe,                          405
  That thou hir see, that cause is of thy sorwe.

  59. Now rys, my dere brother Troilus;
  For certes, it noon honour is to thee
  To wepe, and in thy bed to iouken thus.
  For trewely, of o thing trust to me,                                  410
  If thou thus ligge a day, or two, or three,
  The folk wol wene that thou, for cowardyse,
  Thee feynest syk, and that thou darst not ryse.'

  60. This Troilus answerde, 'O brother dere,
  This knowen folk that han y-suffred peyne,                            415
  That though he wepe and make sorwful chere,
  That feleth harm and smert in every veyne,
  No wonder is; and though I ever pleyne,
  Or alwey wepe, I am no-thing to blame,
  Sin I have lost the cause of al my game.                              420

  61. But sin of fyne force I moot aryse,
  I shal aryse, as sone as ever I may;
  And god, to whom myn herte I sacrifyse,
  So sende us hastely the tenthe day!
  For was ther never fowl so fayn of May,                               425
  As I shal been, whan that she cometh in Troye,
  That cause is of my torment and my Ioye.

  62. But whider is thy reed,' quod Troilus,
  'That we may pleye us best in al this toun?'
  'By god, my conseil is,' quod Pandarus,                               430
  'To ryde and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.'
  So longe of this they speken up and doun,
  Til Troilus gan at the laste assente
  To ryse, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente.

  63. This Sarpedoun, as he that honourable                             435
  Was ever his lyve, and ful of heigh prowesse,
  With al that mighte y-served been on table,
  That deyntee was, al coste it greet richesse,
  He fedde hem day by day, that swich noblesse,
  As seyden bothe the moste and eek the leste,                          440
  Was never er that day wist at any feste.

  64. Nor in this world ther is non instrument
  Delicious, through wind, or touche, or corde,
  As fer as any wight hath ever y-went,
  That tonge telle or herte may recorde,                                445
  That at that feste it nas wel herd acorde;
  Ne of ladies eek so fayr a companye
  On daunce, er tho, was never y-seyn with yë.

  65. But what avayleth this to Troilus,
  That for his sorwe no-thing of it roughte?                            450
  For ever in oon his herte piëtous
  Ful bisily Criseyde his lady soughte.
  On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte.
  Now this, now that, so faste imagininge,
  That glade, y-wis, can him no festeyinge.                             455

  66. These ladies eek that at this feste been,
  Sin that he saw his lady was a-weye,
  It was his sorwe upon hem for to seen,
  Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye.
  For she, that of his herte berth the keye,                            460
  Was absent, lo, this was his fantasye,
  That no wight sholde make melodye.

  67. Nor ther nas houre in al the day or night,
  Whan he was ther-as no wight mighte him here,
  That he ne seyde, 'O lufsom lady bright,                              465
  How have ye faren, sin that ye were here?
  Wel-come, y-wis, myn owene lady dere.'
  But welaway, al this nas but a mase;
  Fortune his howve entended bet to glase.

  68. The lettres eek, that she of olde tyme                            470
  Hadde him y-sent, he wolde allone rede,
  An hundred sythe, a-twixen noon and pryme;
  Refiguringe hir shap, hir womanhede,
  With-inne his herte, and every word and dede
  That passed was, and thus he droof to an ende                         475
  The ferthe day, and seyde, he wolde wende.

  69. And seyde, 'leve brother Pandarus,
  Intendestow that we shul herë bleve
  Til Sarpedoun wol forth congeyen us?
  Yet were it fairer that we toke our leve.                             480
  For goddes love, lat us now sone at eve
  Our leve take, and homward lat us torne;
  For trewely, I nil not thus soiorne.'

  70. Pandare answerde, 'be we comen hider
  To fecchen fyr, and rennen hoom ayeyn?                                485
  God helpe me so, I can not tellen whider
  We mighten goon, if I shal soothly seyn,
  Ther any wight is of us more fayn
  Than Sarpedoun; and if we hennes hye
  Thus sodeinly, I holde it vilanye,                                    490

  71. Sin that we seyden that we wolde bleve
  With him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly,
  The ferthe day to take of him our leve,
  He wolde wondren on it, trewely!
  Lat us holde forth our purpos fermely;                                495
  And sin that ye bihighten him to byde,
  Hold forward now, and after lat us ryde.'

  72. Thus Pandarus, with alle peyne and wo,
  Made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende,
  Of Sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho,                                  500
  And on hir wey they spedden hem to wende.
  Quod Troilus, 'now god me grace sende,
  That I may finden, at myn hom-cominge,
  Criseyde comen!' and ther-with gan he singe.

  73. 'Ye, hasel-wode!' thoughte this Pandare,                          505
  And to him-self ful softely he seyde,
  'God woot, refreyden may this hote fare
  Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!'
  But natheles, he Iaped thus, and seyde,
  And swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte,                          510
  She wolde come as sone as ever she mighte.

  74. Whan they un-to the paleys were y-comen
  Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte,
  And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen.
  And in-to tyme that it gan to nighte,                                 515
  They spaken of Crisëyde the brighte.
  And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,
  They spedde hem fro the soper un-to reste.

  75. On morwe, as sone as day bigan to clere,
  This Troilus gan of his sleep tabreyde,                               520
  And to Pandare, his owene brother dere,
  'For love of god,' ful pitously he seyde,
  'As go we seen the paleys of Criseyde;
  For sin we yet may have namore feste,
  So lat us seen hir paleys at the leste.'                              525

  76. And ther-with-al, his meyne for to blende,
  A cause he fond in toune for to go,
  And to Criseydes hous they gonnen wende.
  But lord! this sely Troilus was wo!
  Him thoughte his sorweful herte braste a-two.                         530
  For whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle,
  Wel neigh for sorwe a-doun he gan to falle.

  77. Therwith whan he was war and gan biholde
  How shet was every windowe of the place,
  As frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde;                       535
  For which with chaunged deedlich pale face,
  With-outen word, he forth bigan to pace;
  And, as god wolde, he gan so faste ryde,
  That no wight of his contenaunce aspyde.

  78. Than seyde he thus, 'O paleys desolat,                            540
  O hous, of houses whylom best y-hight,
  O paleys empty and disconsolat,
  O thou lanterne, of which queynt is the light,
  O paleys, whylom day, that now art night,
  Wel oughtestow to falle, and I to dye,                                545
  Sin she is went that wont was us to gye!

  79. O paleys, whylom croune of houses alle,
  Enlumined with sonne of alle blisse!
  O ring, fro which the ruby is out-falle,
  O cause of wo, that cause hast been of lisse!                         550
  Yet, sin I may no bet, fayn wolde I kisse
  Thy colde dores, dorste I for this route;
  And fare-wel shryne, of which the seynt is oute!'

  80. Ther-with he caste on Pandarus his yë
  With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde;                            555
  And whan he mighte his tyme aright aspye,
  Ay as he rood, to Pandarus he tolde
  His newe sorwe, and eek his Ioyes olde,
  So pitously and with so dede an hewe,
  That every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe.                            560

  81. Fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun,
  And every thing com him to remembraunce
  As he rood forth by places of the toun
  In whiche he whylom hadde al his plesaunce.
  'Lo, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce;                              565
  And in that temple, with hir eyen clere,
  Me caughte first my righte lady dere.

  82. And yonder have I herd ful lustily
  My dere herte laughe, and yonder pleye
  Saugh I hir ones eek ful blisfully.                                   570
  And yonder ones to me gan she seye,
  "Now goode swete, love me wel, I preye."
  And yond so goodly gan she me biholde,
  That to the deeth myn herte is to hir holde.

  83. And at that corner, in the yonder hous,                           575
  Herde I myn alderlevest lady dere
  So wommanly, with voys melodious,
  Singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere,
  That in my soule yet me thinketh I here
  The blisful soun; and, in that yonder place,                          580
  My lady first me took un-to hir grace.'

  84. Thanne thoughte he thus, 'O blisful lord Cupyde,
  Whanne I the proces have in my memorie,
  How thou me hast werreyed on every syde,
  Men mighte a book make of it, lyk a storie.                           585
  What nede is thee to seke on me victorie,
  Sin I am thyn, and hoolly at thy wille?
  What Ioye hastow thyn owene folk to spille?

  85. Wel hastow, lord, y-wroke on me thyn ire,
  Thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve!                            590
  Now mercy, lord, thou wost wel I desire
  Thy grace most, of alle lustes leve.
  And live and deye I wol in thy bileve;
  For which I naxe in guerdon but a bone,
  That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone.                               595

  86. Distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne
  As thou dost myn to longen hir to see;
  Than woot I wel, that she nil not soiorne.
  Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be
  Un-to the blood of Troye, I preye thee,                               600
  As Iuno was un-to the blood Thebane,
  For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.'

  87. And after this he to the yates wente
  Ther-as Criseyde out-rood a ful good paas,
  And up and doun ther made he many a wente,                            605
  And to him-self ful ofte he seyde 'allas!
  From hennes rood my blisse and my solas!
  As wolde blisful god now, for his Ioye,
  I mighte hir seen ayein come in-to Troye.

  88. And to the yonder hille I gan hir gyde,                           610
  Allas! and there I took of hir my leve!
  And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ryde,
  For sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve.
  And hider hoom I com whan it was eve;
  And here I dwelle out-cast from alle Ioye,                            615
  And shal, til I may seen hir eft in Troye.'

  89. And of him-self imagined he ofte
  To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse
  Than he was wont, and that men seyde softe,
  'What may it be? who can the sothe gesse                              620
  Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?'
  And al this nas but his malencolye,
  That he hadde of him-self swich fantasye.

  90. Another tyme imaginen he wolde
  That every wight that wente by the weye                               625
  Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde,
  'I am right sory Troilus wol deye.'
  And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye.
  As ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede,
  As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede.                             630

  91. For which him lyked in his songes shewe
  Thencheson of his wo, as he best mighte,
  And make a song of wordes but a fewe,
  Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.
  And whan he was from every mannes sighte,                             635
  With softe voys he, of his lady dere,
  That was absent, gan singe as ye may here.

  92. 'O sterre, of which I lost have al the light,
  With herte soor wel oughte I to bewayle,
  That ever derk in torment, night by night,                            640
  Toward my deeth with wind in stere I sayle;
  For which the tenthe night if that I fayle
  The gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre,
  My ship and me Caribdis wol devoure.'

  93. This song when he thus songen hadde, sone                         645
  He fil ayein in-to his sykes olde;
  And every night, as was his wone to done,
  He stood the brighte mone to beholde,
  And al his sorwe he to the mone tolde;
  And seyde, 'y-wis, whan thou art horned newe,                         650
  I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!

  94. I saugh thyn hornes olde eek by the morwe,
  Whan hennes rood my righte lady dere,
  That cause is of my torment and my sorwe;
  For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere,                               655
  For love of god, ren faste aboute thy spere!
  For whan thyn hornes newe ginne springe,
  Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!'

  95. The day is more, and lenger every night,
  Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho;                            660
  And that the sonne wente his course unright
  By lenger wey than it was wont to go;
  And seyde, 'y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo,
  The sonnes sone, Pheton, be on-lyve,
  And that his fadres cart amis he dryve.'                              665

  96. Upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke,
  And on the Grekes ost he wolde see,
  And to him-self right thus he wolde talke,
  'Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free,
  Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be!                                  670
  And thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote,
  That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.

  97. And hardely this wind, that more and more
  Thus stoundemele encreseth in my face,
  Is of my ladyes depe sykes sore.                                      675
  I preve it thus, for in non othere place
  Of al this toun, save onliche in this space,
  Fele I no wind that souneth so lyk peyne;
  It seyth, "allas! why twinned be we tweyne?"'

  98. This longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus,                      680
  Til fully passed was the nynthe night;
  And ay bi-syde him was this Pandarus,
  That bisily dide alle his fulle might
  Him to comforte, and make his herte light;
  Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe                              685
  That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe.

  99. Up-on that other syde eek was Criseyde,
  With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;
  For which ful ofte a day 'allas!' she seyde,
  'That I was born! Wel may myn herte longe                             690
  After my deeth; for now live I to longe!
  Allas! and I ne may it not amende;
  For now is wors than ever yet I wende.

  100. My fader nil for no-thing do me grace
  To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;                            695
  And if so be that I my terme passe,
  My Troilus shal in his herte deme
  That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.
  Thus shal I have unthank on every syde;
  That I was born, so weylawey the tyde!                                700

  101. And if that I me putte in Iupartye,
  To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle
  That I be caught, I shal be holde a spye;
  Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle,
  If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle,                              705
  I am but lost, al be myn herte trewe;
  Now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!'

  102. Ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face,
  Hir limes lene, as she that al the day
  Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place                         710
  Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.
  And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay.
  And thus despeired, out of alle cure,
  She ladde hir lyf, this woful creature.

  103. Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse,                     715
  And in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge
  Of Troilus the grete worthinesse,
  And alle his goodly wordes recordinge
  Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.
  And thus she sette hir woful herte a-fyre                             720
  Thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desyre.

  104. In al this world ther nis so cruel herte
  That hir hadde herd compleynen in hir sorwe,
  That nolde han wopen for hir peynes smerte,
  So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe.                            725
  Hir nedede no teres for to borwe.
  And this was yet the worste of al hir peyne,
  Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleyne.

  105. Ful rewfully she loked up-on Troye,
  Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles;                          730
  'Allas!' quod she, 'the plesaunce and the Ioye
  The whiche that now al torned in-to galle is,
  Have I had ofte with-inne yonder walles!
  O Troilus, what dostow now,' she seyde;
  'Lord! whether yet thou thenke up-on Criseyde?                        735

  106. Allas! I ne hadde trowed on your lore,
  And went with yow, as ye me radde er this!
  Thanne hadde I now not syked half so sore.
  Who mighte have seyd, that I had doon a-mis
  To stele awey with swich on as he is?                                 740
  But al to late cometh the letuarie,
  Whan men the cors un-to the grave carie.

  107. To late is now to speke of this matere;
  Prudence, allas! oon of thyn eyen three
  Me lakked alwey, er that I cam here;                                  745
  On tyme y-passed, wel remembred me;
  And present tyme eek coude I wel y-see.
  But futur tyme, er I was in the snare,
  Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care.

  108. But natheles, bityde what bityde,                                750
  I shal to-morwe at night, by est or weste,
  Out of this ost stele on som maner syde,
  And go with Troilus wher-as him leste.
  This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste.
  No fors of wikked tonges Ianglerye,                                   755
  For ever on love han wrecches had envye.

  109. For who-so wole of every word take hede,
  Or rewlen him by every wightes wit,
  Ne shal he never thryven, out of drede.
  For that that som men blamen ever yit,                                760
  Lo, other maner folk commenden it.
  And as for me, for al swich variaunce,
  Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.

  110. For which, with-outen any wordes mo,
  To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.'                                  765
  But god it wot, er fully monthes two,
  She was ful fer fro that entencioun.
  For bothe Troilus and Troye toun
  Shal knotteles through-out hir herte slyde;
  For she wol take a purpos for tabyde.                                 770

  111. This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,
  Goth now, with-inne him-self ay arguinge
  With al the sleighte and al that ever he can,
  How he may best, with shortest taryinge,
  In-to his net Criseydes herte bringe.                                 775
  To this entente he coude never fyne;
  To fisshen hir, he leyde out hook and lyne.

  112. But natheles, wel in his herte he thoughte,
  That she nas nat with-oute a love in Troye.
  For never, sithen he hir thennes broughte,                            780
  Ne coude he seen her laughe or make Ioye.
  He niste how best hir herte for tacoye.
  'But for to assaye,' he seyde, 'it nought ne greveth;
  For he that nought nassayeth, nought nacheveth.'

  113. Yet seide he to him-self upon a night,                           785
  'Now am I not a fool, that woot wel how
  Hir wo for love is of another wight,
  And here-up-on to goon assaye hir now?
  I may wel wite, it nil not been my prow.
  For wyse folk in bokes it expresse,                                   790
  "Men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse."

  114. But who-so mighte winnen swich a flour
  From him, for whom she morneth night and day,
  He mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.'
  And right anoon, as he that bold was ay,                              795
  Thoughte in his herte, 'happe, how happe may,
  Al sholde I deye, I wole hir herte seche;
  I shal no more lesen but my speche.'

  115. This Diomede, as bokes us declare,
  Was in his nedes prest and corageous;                                 800
  With sterne voys and mighty limes square,
  Hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous
  Of dedes, lyk his fader Tideus.
  And som men seyn, he was of tunge large;
  And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge.                                805

  116. Criseyde mene was of hir stature,
  Ther-to of shap, of face, and eek of chere,
  Ther mighte been no fairer creature.
  And ofte tyme this was hir manere,
  To gon y-tressed with hir heres clere                                 810
  Doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde,
  Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde.

  117. And, save hir browes ioyneden y-fere,
  Ther nas no lak, in ought I can espyen;
  But for to speken of hir eyen clere,                                  815
  Lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen,
  That Paradys stood formed in hir yën.
  And with hir riche beautee ever-more
  Strof love in hir, ay which of hem was more.

  118. She sobre was, eek simple, and wys with-al,                      820
  The beste y-norisshed eek that mighte be,
  And goodly of hir speche in general,
  Charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free;
  Ne never-mo ne lakkede hir pitee;
  Tendre-herted, slydinge of corage;                                    825
  But trewely, I can not telle hir age.

  119. And Troilus wel waxen was in highte,
  And complet formed by proporcioun
  So wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte;
  Yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lyoun;                            830
  Trewe as steel in ech condicioun;
  On of the beste enteched creature,
  That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.

  120. And certainly in storie it is y-founde,
  That Troilus was never un-to no wight,                                835
  As in his tyme, in no degree secounde
  In durring don that longeth to a knight.
  Al mighte a geaunt passen him of might,
  His herte ay with the firste and with the beste
  Stod paregal, to durre don that him leste.                            840

  121. But for to tellen forth of Diomede:--
  It fil that after, on the tenthe day,
  Sin that Criseyde out of the citee yede,
  This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May,
  Com to the tente ther-as Calkas lay,                                  845
  And feyned him with Calkas han to done;
  But what he mente, I shal yow telle sone.

  122. Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle,
  Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette;
  And he was ethe y-nough to maken dwelle.                              850
  And after this, with-outen longe lette,
  The spyces and the wyn men forth hem fette;
  And forth they speke of this and that y-fere,
  As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here.

  123. He gan first fallen of the werre in speche                       855
  Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troye toun;
  And of thassege he gan hir eek byseche,
  To telle him what was hir opinioun.
  Fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun
  To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte                           860
  The Grekes gyse, and werkes that they wroughte?

  124. And why hir fader tarieth so longe
  To wedden hir un-to som worthy wight?
  Criseyde, that was in hir peynes stronge
  For love of Troilus, hir owene knight,                                865
  As fer-forth as she conning hadde or might,
  Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente,
  It semed not she wiste what he mente.

  125. But natheles, this ilke Diomede
  Gan in him-self assure, and thus he seyde,                            870
  'If ich aright have taken of yow hede,
  Me thinketh thus, O lady myn, Criseyde,
  That sin I first hond on your brydel leyde,
  Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe,
  Ne coude I never seen yow but in sorwe.                               875

  126. Can I not seyn what may the cause be
  But-if for love of som Troyan it were,
  The which right sore wolde athinken me
  That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there,
  Sholden spille a quarter of a tere,                                   880
  Or pitously your-selven so bigyle;
  For dredelees, it is nought worth the whyle.

  127. The folk of Troye, as who seyth, alle and some
  In preson been, as ye your-selven see;
  For thennes shal not oon on-lyve come                                 885
  For al the gold bitwixen sonne and see.
  Trusteth wel, and understondeth me,
  Ther shal not oon to mercy goon on-lyve,
  Al were he lord of worldes twyës fyve!

  128. Swich wreche on hem, for fecching of Eleyne,                     890
  Ther shal be take, er that we hennes wende,
  That Manes, which that goddes ben of peyne,
  Shal been agast that Grekes wol hem shende.
  And men shul drede, un-to the worldes ende,
  From hennes-forth to ravisshe any quene,                              895
  So cruel shal our wreche on hem be sene.

  129. And but-if Calkas lede us with ambages,
  That is to seyn, with double wordes slye,
  Swich as men clepe a "word with two visages,"
  Ye shul wel knowen that I nought ne lye,                              900
  And al this thing right seen it with your yë,
  And that anoon; ye nil not trowe how sone;
  Now taketh heed, for it is for to done.

  130. What wene ye your wyse fader wolde
  Han yeven Antenor for yow anoon,                                      905
  If he ne wiste that the citee sholde
  Destroyed been? Why, nay, so mote I goon!
  He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen oon
  That Troyan is; and for the grete fere,
  He dorste not, ye dwelte lenger there.                                910

  131. What wole ye more, lufsom lady dere?
  Lat Troye and Troyan fro your herte pace!
  Dryf out that bittre hope, and make good chere,
  And clepe ayein the beautee of your face,
  That ye with salte teres so deface.                                   915
  For Troye is brought in swich a Iupartye,
  That, it to save, is now no remedye.

  132. And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes finde,
  A more parfit love, er it be night,
  Than any Troyan is, and more kinde,                                   920
  And bet to serven yow wol doon his might.
  And if ye vouche sauf, my lady bright,
  I wol ben he to serven yow my-selve,
  Ye, lever than be lord of Greces twelve!'

  133. And with that word he gan to waxen reed,                         925
  And in his speche a litel wight he quook,
  And caste a-syde a litel wight his heed,
  And stinte a whyle; and afterward awook,
  And sobreliche on hir he threw his look,
  And seyde, 'I am, al be it yow no Ioye,                               930
  As gentil man as any wight in Troye.

  134. For if my fader Tydeus,' he seyde,
  'Y-lived hadde, I hadde been, er this,
  Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde!
  And so hope I that I shal yet, y-wis.                                 935
  But he was slayn, allas! the more harm is,
  Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe,
  Polymites and many a man to scathe.

  135. But herte myn, sin that I am your man,
  And been the ferste of whom I seche grace,                            940
  To serven you as hertely as I can,
  And ever shal, whyl I to live have space,
  So, er that I departe out of this place,
  Ye wol me graunte, that I may to-morwe,
  At bettre leyser, telle yow my sorwe.'                                945

  136. What shold I telle his wordes that he seyde?
  He spak y-now, for o day at the meste;
  It preveth wel, he spak so that Criseyde
  Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste,
  For to speken with him at the leste,                                  950
  So that he nolde speke of swich matere;
  And thus to him she seyde, as ye may here:

  137. As she that hadde hir herte on Troilus
  So faste, that ther may it noon arace;
  And straungely she spak, and seyde thus:                              955
  'O Diomede, I love that ilke place
  Ther I was born; and Ioves, for his grace,
  Delivere it sone of al that doth it care!
  God, for thy might, so leve it wel to fare!

  138. That Grekes wolde hir wraththe on Troye wreke,                   960
  If that they mighte, I knowe it wel, y-wis.
  But it shal not bifallen as ye speke;
  And god to-forn, and ferther over this,
  I wot my fader wys and redy is;
  And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde,                           965
  So dere, I am the more un-to him holde.

  139. That Grekes been of heigh condicioun,
  I woot eek wel; but certein, men shal finde
  As worthy folk with-inne Troye toun,
  As conning, and as parfit and as kinde,                               970
  As been bitwixen Orcades and Inde.
  And that ye coude wel your lady serve,
  I trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve.

  140. But as to speke of love, y-wis,' she seyde,
  'I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,                                975
  The whos myn herte al was, til that he deyde;
  And other love, as helpe me now Pallas,
  Ther in myn herte nis, ne never was.
  And that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede,
  I have wel herd it tellen, out of drede.                              980

  141. And that doth me to han so gret a wonder,
  That ye wol scornen any womman so.
  Eek, god wot, love and I be fer a-sonder;
  I am disposed bet, so mote I go,
  Un-to my deeth, to pleyne and maken wo.                               985
  What I shal after doon, I can not seye;
  But trewely, as yet me list not pleye.

  142. Myn herte is now in tribulacioun,
  And ye in armes bisy, day by day.
  Here-after, whan ye wonnen han the toun,                              990
  Paraunter, thanne so it happen may,
  That whan I see that I never er say,
  Than wole I werke that I never wroughte!
  This word to yow y-nough suffysen oughte.

  143. To-morwe eek wol I speke with yow fayn,                          995
  So that ye touchen nought of this matere.
  And whan yow list, ye may come here ayeyn;
  And, er ye gon, thus muche I seye yow here:
  As helpe me Pallas with hir heres clere,
  If that I sholde of any Greek han routhe,                            1000
  It sholde be your-selven, by my trouthe!

  144. I sey not therfore that I wol yow love,
  Ne I sey not nay, but in conclusioun,
  I mene wel, by god that sit above:'--
  And ther-with-al she caste hir eyen doun,                            1005
  And gan to syke, and seyde, 'O Troye toun,
  Yet bidde I god, in quiete and in reste
  I may yow seen, or do myn herte breste.'

  145. But in effect, and shortly for to seye,
  This Diomede al freshly newe ayeyn                                   1010
  Gan pressen on, and faste hir mercy preye;
  And after this, the sothe for to seyn,
  Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fayn.
  And fynally, whan it was waxen eve,
  And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.                           1015

  146. The brighte Venus folwede and ay taughte
  The wey, ther brode Phebus doun alighte;
  And Cynthea hir char-hors over-raughte
  To whirle out of the Lyon, if she mighte;
  And Signifer his candeles shewed brighte,                            1020
  Whan that Criseyde un-to hir bedde wente
  In-with hir fadres faire brighte tente.

  147. Retorning in hir soule ay up and doun
  The wordes of this sodein Diomede,
  His greet estat, and peril of the toun,                              1025
  And that she was allone and hadde nede
  Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede
  The cause why, the sothe for to telle,
  That she tok fully purpos for to dwelle.

  148. The morwe com, and goostly for to speke,                        1030
  This Diomede is come un-to Criseyde,
  And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,
  So wel he for him-selve spak and seyde,
  That alle hir sykes sore adoun he leyde.
  And fynally, the sothe for to seyne,                                 1035
  He refte hir of the grete of al hir peyne.

  149. And after this the story telleth us,
  That she him yaf the faire baye stede,
  The which he ones wan of Troilus;
  And eek a broche (and that was litel nede)                           1040
  That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede.
  And eek, the bet from sorwe him to releve,
  She made him were a pencel of hir sleve.

  150. I finde eek in the stories elles-where,
  Whan through the body hurt was Diomede                               1045
  Of Troilus, tho weep she many a tere,
  Whan that she saugh his wyde woundes blede;
  And that she took to kepen him good hede,
  And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte.
  Men seyn, I not, that she yaf him hir herte.                         1050

  151. But trewely, the story telleth us,
  Ther made never womman more wo
  Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus.
  She seyde, 'allas! for now is clene a-go
  My name of trouthe in love, for ever-mo!                             1055
  For I have falsed oon, the gentileste
  That ever was, and oon the worthieste!

  152. Allas, of me, un-to the worldes ende,
  Shal neither been y-writen nor y-songe
  No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende.                         1060
  O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge;
  Through-out the world my belle shal be ronge;
  And wommen most wol hate me of alle.
  Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!

  153. They wol seyn, in as muche as in me is,                         1065
  I have hem don dishonour, weylawey!
  Al be I not the firste that dide amis,
  What helpeth that to do my blame awey?
  But sin I see there is no bettre way,
  And that to late is now for me to rewe,                              1070
  To Diomede algate I wol be trewe.

  154. But Troilus, sin I no better may,
  And sin that thus departen ye and I,
  Yet preye I god, so yeve yow right good day
  As for the gentileste, trewely,                                      1075
  That ever I say, to serven feithfully,
  And best can ay his lady honour kepe:'--
  And with that word she brast anon to wepe.

  155. 'And certes, yow ne haten shal I never,
  And freendes love, that shal ye han of me,                           1080
  And my good word, al mighte I liven ever.
  And, trewely, I wolde sory be
  For to seen yow in adversitee.
  And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve;
  But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.'                         1085

  156. But trewely, how longe it was bitwene,
  That she for-sook him for this Diomede,
  Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene.
  Take every man now to his bokes hede;
  He shal no terme finden, out of drede.                               1090
  For though that he bigan to wowe hir sone,
  Er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done.

  157. Ne me ne list this sely womman chyde
  Ferther than the story wol devyse.
  Hir name, allas! is publisshed so wyde,                              1095
  That for hir gilt it oughte y-now suffyse.
  And if I mighte excuse hir any wyse,
  For she so sory was for hir untrouthe,
  Y-wis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe.

  158. This Troilus, as I biforn have told,                            1100
  Thus dryveth forth, as wel as he hath might.
  But often was his herte hoot and cold,
  And namely, that ilke nynthe night,
  Which on the morwe she hadde him byhight
  To come ayein: god wot, ful litel reste                              1105
  Hadde he that night; no-thing to slepe him leste.

  159. The laurer-crouned Phebus, with his hete,
  Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente,
  To warmen of the est see the wawes wete;
  And Nisus doughter song with fresh entente,                          1110
  Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente;
  And on the walles of the toun they pleyde,
  To loke if they can seen ought of Criseyde.

  160. Til it was noon, they stoden for to see
  Who that ther come; and every maner wight,                           1115
  That cam fro fer, they seyden it was she,
  Til that they coude knowen him a-right.
  Now was his herte dul, now was it light;
  And thus by-iaped stonden for to stare
  Aboute nought, this Troilus and Pandare.                             1120

  161. To Pandarus this Troilus tho seyde,
  'For ought I wot, bi-for noon, sikerly,
  In-to this toun ne comth nought here Criseyde.
  She hath y-now to done, hardily,
  To winnen from hir fader, so trowe I;                                1125
  Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dyne
  Er that she go; god yeve his herte pyne!'

  162. Pandare answerde, 'it may wel be, certeyn;
  And for-thy lat us dyne, I thee biseche;
  And after noon than mayst thou come ayeyn.'                          1130
  And hoom they go, with-oute more speche;
  And comen ayein, but longe may they seche
  Er that they finde that they after cape;
  Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to Iape.

  163. Quod Troilus, 'I see wel now, that she                          1135
  Is taried with hir olde fader so,
  That er she come, it wol neigh even be.
  Com forth, I wol un-to the yate go.
  Thise portours been unkonninge ever-mo;
  And I wol doon hem holden up the yate                                1140
  As nought ne were, al-though she come late.'

  164. The day goth faste, and after that comth eve,
  And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde.
  He loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve,
  And fer his heed over the wal he leyde.                              1145
  And at the laste he torned him, and seyde,
  'By god, I woot hir mening now, Pandare!
  Al-most, y-wis, al newe was my care.

  165. Now douteles, this lady can hir good;
  I woot, she meneth ryden prively.                                    1150
  I comende hir wysdom, by myn hood!
  She wol not maken peple nycely
  Gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely
  By nighte in-to the toun she thenketh ryde.
  And, dere brother, thenk not longe to abyde.                         1155

  166. We han nought elles for to don, y-wis.
  And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me?
  Have here my trouthe, I see hir! yond she is.
  Heve up thyn eyen, man! maystow not see?'
  Pandare answerde, 'nay, so mote I thee!                              1160
  Al wrong, by god; what seystow, man, wher art?
  That I see yond nis but a fare-cart.'

  167. 'Allas, thou seist right sooth,' quod Troilus;
  'But hardely, it is not al for nought
  That in myn herte I now reioyse thus.                                1165
  It is ayein som good I have a thought.
  Noot I not how, but sin that I was wrought,
  Ne felte I swich a confort, dar I seye;
  She comth to-night, my lyf, that dorste I leye!'

  168. Pandare answerde, 'it may be wel, y-nough';                     1170
  And held with him of al that ever he seyde;
  But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough,
  And to him-self ful sobrely he seyde:
  'From hasel-wode, ther Ioly Robin pleyde,
  Shal come al that that thou abydest here;                            1175
  Ye, fare-wel al the snow of ferne yere!'

  169. The wardein of the yates gan to calle
  The folk which that with-oute the yates were,
  And bad hem dryven in hir bestes alle,
  Or al the night they moste bleven there.                             1180
  And fer with-in the night, with many a tere,
  This Troilus gan hoomward for to ryde;
  For wel he seeth it helpeth nought tabyde.

  170. But natheles, he gladded him in this;
  He thoughte he misacounted hadde his day,                            1185
  And seyde, 'I understonde have al a-mis.
  For thilke night I last Criseyde say,
  She seyde, "I shal ben here, if that I may,
  Er that the mone, O dere herte swete!
  The Lyon passe, out of this Ariete."                                 1190

  171. For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.'
  And on the morwe un-to the yate he wente,
  And up and down, by west and eek by este,
  Up-on the walles made he many a wente.
  But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente;                        1195
  For which at night, in sorwe and sykes sore
  He wente him hoom, with-outen any more.

  172. This hope al clene out of his herte fledde,
  He nath wher-on now lenger for to honge;
  But for the peyne him thoughte his herte bledde,                     1200
  So were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge.
  For when he saugh that she abood so longe,
  He niste what he iuggen of it mighte,
  Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte.

  173. The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day                           1205
  After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde,
  Bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay,
  Yet som-what trustinge on hir hestes olde.
  But whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde,
  He can now seen non other remedye,                                   1210
  But for to shape him sone for to dye.

  174. Ther-with the wikked spirit, god us blesse,
  Which that men clepeth wode Ialousye,
  Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse;
  For which, by-cause he wolde sone dye,                               1215
  He ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolye,
  And eek from every companye he fledde;
  This was the lyf that al the tyme he ledde.

  175. He so defet was, that no maner man
  Unnethe mighte him knowe ther he wente;                              1220
  So was he lene, and ther-to pale and wan,
  And feble, that he walketh by potente;
  And with his ire he thus him-selven shente.
  And who-so axed him wher-of him smerte,
  He seyde, his harm was al aboute his herte.                          1225

  176. Pryam ful ofte, and eek his moder dere,
  His bretheren and his sustren gonne him freyne
  Why he so sorwful was in al his chere,
  And what thing was the cause of al his peyne?
  But al for nought; he nolde his cause pleyne,                        1230
  But seyde, he felte a grevous maladye
  A-boute his herte, and fayn he wolde dye.

  177. So on a day he leyde him doun to slepe,
  And so bifel that in his sleep him thoughte,
  That in a forest faste he welk to wepe                               1235
  For love of hir that him these peynes wroughte;
  And up and doun as he the forest soughte,
  He mette he saugh a boor with tuskes grete,
  That sleep ayein the brighte sonnes hete.

  178. And by this boor, faste in his armes folde,                     1240
  Lay kissing ay his lady bright Criseyde:
  For sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde,
  And for despyt, out of his slepe he breyde,
  And loude he cryde on Pandarus, and seyde,
  'O Pandarus, now knowe I crop and rote!                              1245
  I nam but deed, ther nis non other bote!

  179. My lady bright Criseyde hath me bitrayed,
  In whom I trusted most of any wight,
  She elles-where hath now hir herte apayed;
  The blisful goddes, through hir grete might,                         1250
  Han in my dreem y-shewed it ful right.
  Thus in my dreem Criseyde I have biholde'--
  And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde.

  180. 'O my Criseyde, allas! what subtiltee,
  What newe lust, what beautee, what science,                          1255
  What wratthe of iuste cause have ye to me?
  What gilt of me, whal fel experience
  Hath fro me raft, allas! thyn advertence?
  O trust, O feyth, O depe asëuraunce,
  Who hath me reft Criseyde, al my plesaunce?                          1260

  181. Allas! why leet I you from hennes go,
  For which wel neigh out of my wit I breyde?
  Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
  God wot I wende, O lady bright, Criseyde,
  That every word was gospel that ye seyde!                            1265
  But who may bet bigylen, if him liste,
  Than he on whom men weneth best to triste?

  182. What shal I doon, my Pandarus, allas!
  I fele now so sharpe a newe peyne,
  Sin that ther is no remedie in this cas,                             1270
  That bet were it I with myn hondes tweyne
  My-selven slow, than alwey thus to pleyne.
  For through my deeth my wo sholde han an ende,
  Ther every day with lyf my-self I shende.'

  183. Pandare answerde and seyde, 'allas the whyle                    1275
  That I was born; have I not seyd er this,
  That dremes many a maner man bigyle?
  And why? for folk expounden hem a-mis.
  How darstow seyn that fals thy lady is,
  For any dreem, right for thyn owene drede?                           1280
  Lat be this thought, thou canst no dremes rede.

  184. Paraunter, ther thou dremest of this boor,
  It may so be that it may signifye
  Hir fader, which that old is and eek hoor,
  Ayein the sonne lyth, on poynt to dye,                               1285
  And she for sorwe ginneth wepe and crye,
  And kisseth him, ther he lyth on the grounde;
  Thus shuldestow thy dreem a-right expounde.'

  185. 'How mighte I thanne do?' quod Troilus,
  'To knowe of this, ye, were it never so lyte?'                       1290
  'Now seystow wysly,' quod this Pandarus,
  'My reed is this, sin thou canst wel endyte,
  That hastely a lettre thou hir wryte,
  Thorugh which thou shalt wel bringen it aboute,
  To knowe a sooth of that thou art in doute.                          1295

  186. And see now why; for this I dar wel seyn,
  That if so is that she untrewe be,
  I can not trowe that she wol wryte ayeyn.
  And if she wryte, thou shalt ful sone see,
  As whether she hath any libertee                                     1300
  To come ayein, or elles in som clause,
  If she be let, she wol assigne a cause.

  187. Thou hast not writen hir sin that she wente,
  Nor she to thee, and this I dorste leye,
  Ther may swich cause been in hir entente,                            1305
  That hardely thou wolt thy-selven seye,
  That hir a-bood the beste is for yow tweye.
  Now wryte hir thanne, and thou shalt fele sone
  A sothe of al; ther is no more to done.'

  188. Acorded been to this conclusioun,                               1310
  And that anoon, these ilke lordes two;
  And hastely sit Troilus adoun,
  And rolleth in his herte to and fro,
  How he may best discryven hir his wo.
  And to Criseyde, his owene lady dere,                                1315
  He wroot right thus, and seyde as ye may here.

  189. 'Right fresshe flour, whos I have been and shal,
  With-outen part of elles-where servyse,
  With herte, body, lyf, lust, thought, and al;
  I, woful wight, in every humble wyse                                 1320
  That tonge telle or herte may devyse,
  As ofte as matere occupyeth place,
  Me recomaunde un-to your noble grace.

  190. Lyketh it yow to witen, swete herte,
  As ye wel knowe how longe tyme agoon                                 1325
  That ye me lafte in aspre peynes smerte,
  Whan that ye wente, of which yet bote noon
  Have I non had, but ever wers bigoon
  Fro day to day am I, and so mot dwelle,
  While it yow list, of wele and wo my welle!                          1330

  191. For which to yow, with dredful herte trewe,
  I wryte, as he that sorwe dryfth to wryte,
  My wo, that every houre encreseth newe,
  Compleyninge as I dar or can endyte.
  And that defaced is, that may ye wyte                                1335
  The teres, which that fro myn eyen reyne,
  That wolde speke, if that they coude, and pleyne.

  192. Yow first biseche I, that your eyen clere
  To look on this defouled ye not holde;
  And over al this, that ye, my lady dere,                             1340
  Wol vouche-sauf this lettre to biholde.
  And by the cause eek of my cares colde,
  That sleeth my wit, if ought amis me asterte,
  For-yeve it me, myn owene swete herte.

  193. If any servant dorste or oughte of right                        1345
  Up-on his lady pitously compleyne,
  Than wene I, that ich oughte be that wight,
  Considered this, that ye these monthes tweyne
  Han taried, ther ye seyden, sooth to seyne,
  But dayes ten ye nolde in ost soiourne,                              1350
  But in two monthes yet ye not retourne.

  194. But for-as-muche as me mot nedes lyke
  Al that yow list, I dar not pleyne more,
  But humbely with sorwful sykes syke;
  Yow wryte ich myn unresty sorwes sore,                               1355
  Fro day to day desyring ever-more
  To knowen fully, if your wil it were,
  How ye han ferd and doon, whyl ye be there.

  195. The whos wel-fare and hele eek god encresse
  In honour swich, that upward in degree                               1360
  It growe alwey, so that it never cesse;
  Right as your herte ay can, my lady free,
  Devyse, I prey to god so mote it be.
  And graunte it that ye sone up-on me rewe
  As wisly as in al I am yow trewe.                                    1365

  196. And if yow lyketh knowen of the fare
  Of me, whos wo ther may no wight discryve,
  I can no more but, cheste of every care,
  At wrytinge of this lettre I was on-lyve,
  Al redy out my woful gost to dryve;                                  1370
  Which I delaye, and holde him yet in honde,
  Upon the sight of matere of your sonde.

  197. Myn eyen two, in veyn with which I see,
  Of sorweful teres salte arn waxen welles;
  My song, in pleynte of myn adversitee;                               1375
  My good, in harm; myn ese eek waxen helle is.
  My Ioye, in wo; I can sey yow nought elles,
  But turned is, for which my lyf I warie,
  Everich Ioye or ese in his contrarie.

  198. Which with your cominge hoom ayein to Troye                     1380
  Ye may redresse, and, more a thousand sythe
  Than ever ich hadde, encressen in me Ioye.
  For was ther never herte yet so blythe
  To han his lyf, as I shal been as swythe
  As I yow see; and, though no maner routhe                            1385
  Commeve yow, yet thinketh on your trouthe.

  199. And if so be my gilt hath deeth deserved,
  Or if you list no more up-on me see,
  In guerdon yet of that I have you served,
  Biseche I yow, myn hertes lady free,                                 1390
  That here-upon ye wolden wryte me,
  For love of god, my righte lode-sterre,
  Ther deeth may make an ende of al my werre.

  200. If other cause aught doth yow for to dwelle,
  That with your lettre ye me recomforte;                              1395
  For though to me your absence is an helle,
  With pacience I wol my wo comporte.
  And with your lettre of hope I wol desporte.
  Now wryteth, swete, and lat me thus not pleyne;
  With hope, or deeth, delivereth me fro peyne.                        1400

  201. Y-wis, myn owene dere herte trewe,
  I woot that, whan ye next up-on me see,
  So lost have I myn hele and eek myn hewe,
  Criseyde shal nought conne knowe me!
  Y-wis, myn hertes day, my lady free,                                 1405
  So thursteth ay myn herte to biholde
  Your beautee, that my lyf unnethe I holde.

  202. I sey no more, al have I for to seye
  To you wel more than I telle may;
  But whether that ye do me live or deye,                              1410
  Yet pray I god, so yeve yow right good day.
  And fareth wel, goodly fayre fresshe may,
  As ye that lyf or deeth me may comaunde;
  And to your trouthe ay I me recomaunde

  203. With hele swich that, but ye yeven me                           1415
  The same hele, I shal noon hele have.
  In you lyth, whan yow list that it so be,
  The day in which me clothen shal my grave.
  In yow my lyf, in yow might for to save
  Me from disese of alle peynes smerte;                                1420
  And fare now wel, myn owene swete herte!
                              LE VOSTRE T.'

  204. This lettre forth was sent un-to Criseyde,
  Of which hir answere in effect was this;
  Ful pitously she wroot ayein, and seyde,
  That al-so sone as that she might, y-wis,                            1425
  She wolde come, and mende al that was mis.
  And fynally she wroot and seyde him thanne,
  She wolde come, ye, but she niste whanne.

  205. But in hir lettre made she swich festes,
  That wonder was, and swereth she loveth him best,                    1430
  Of which he fond but botmelees bihestes.
  But Troilus, thou mayst now, est or west,
  Pype in an ivy leef, if that thee lest;
  Thus gooth the world; god shilde us fro mischaunce,
  And every wight that meneth trouthe avaunce!                         1435

  206. Encresen gan the wo fro day to night
  Of Troilus, for taryinge of Criseyde;
  And lessen gan his hope and eek his might,
  For which al doun he in his bed him leyde;
  He ne eet, ne dronk, ne sleep, ne word he seyde,                     1440
  Imagininge ay that she was unkinde;
  For which wel neigh he wex out of his minde.

  207. This dreem, of which I told have eek biforn,
  May never come out of his remembraunce;
  He thoughte ay wel he hadde his lady lorn,                           1445
  And that Ioves, of his purveyaunce,
  Him shewed hadde in sleep the signifiaunce
  Of hir untrouthe and his disaventure,
  And that the boor was shewed him in figure.

  208. For which he for Sibille his suster sente,                      1450
  That called was Cassandre eek al aboute;
  And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente,
  And hir bisoughte assoilen him the doute
  Of the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute;
  And fynally, with-inne a litel stounde,                              1455
  Cassandre him gan right thus his dreem expounde.

  209. She gan first smyle, and seyde, 'O brother dere,
  If thou a sooth of this desyrest knowe,
  Thou most a fewe of olde stories here,
  To purpos, how that fortune over-throwe                              1460
  Hath lordes olde; through which, with-inne a throwe,
  Thou wel this boor shalt knowe, and of what kinde
  He comen is, as men in bokes finde.

  210. Diane, which that wrooth was and in ire
  For Grekes nolde doon hir sacrifyse,                                 1465
  Ne encens up-on hir auter sette a-fyre,
  She, for that Grekes gonne hir so dispyse,
  Wrak hir in a wonder cruel wyse.
  For with a boor as greet as oxe in stalle
  She made up frete hir corn and vynes alle.                           1470

  211. To slee this boor was al the contree reysed,
  A-monges which ther com, this boor to see,
  A mayde, oon of this world the best y-preysed;
  And Meleagre, lord of that contree,
  He lovede so this fresshe mayden free                                1475
  That with his manhod, er he wolde stente,
  This boor he slow, and hir the heed he sente;

  212. Of which, as olde bokes tellen us,
  Ther roos a contek and a greet envye;
  And of this lord descended Tydeus                                    1480
  By ligne, or elles olde bokes lye;
  But how this Meleagre gan to dye
  Thorugh his moder, wol I yow not telle,
  For al to long it were for to dwelle.'

  213. She toldë eek how Tydeus, er she stente,                        1485
  Un-to the stronge citee of Thebes,
  To cleyme kingdom of the citee, wente,
  For his felawe, daun Polymites,
  Of which the brother, daun Ethyocles
  Ful wrongfully of Thebes held the strengthe;                         1490
  This tolde she by proces, al by lengthe.

  214. She tolde eek how Hemonides asterte,
  Whan Tydeus slough fifty knightes stoute.
  She told eek al the prophesyes by herte,
  And how that sevene kinges, with hir route,                          1495
  Bisegeden the citee al aboute;
  And of the holy serpent, and the welle,
  And of the furies, al she gan him telle.

  215. Of Archimoris buryinge and the pleyes,
  And how Amphiorax fil through the grounde,                           1500
  How Tydeus was slayn, lord of Argeyes,
  And how Ypomedoun in litel stounde
  Was dreynt, and deed Parthonope of wounde;
  And also how Cappanëus the proude
  With thonder-dint was slayn, that cryde loude.                       1505

  216. She gan eek telle him how that either brother,
  Ethyocles and Polimyte also,
  At a scarmyche, eche of hem slough other,
  And of Argyves wepinge and hir wo;
  And how the town was brent she tolde eek tho.                        1510
  And so descendeth doun from gestes olde
  To Diomede, and thus she spak and tolde.

  217. 'This ilke boor bitokneth Diomede,
  Tydeus sone, that doun descended is
  Fro Meleagre, that made the boor to blede.                           1515
  And thy lady, wher-so she be, y-wis,
  This Diomede hir herte hath, and she his.
  Weep if thou wolt, or leef; for, out of doute,
  This Diomede is inne, and thou art oute.'

  218. 'Thou seyst nat sooth,' quod he, 'thou sorceresse,              1520
  With al thy false goost of prophesye!
  Thou wenest been a greet devyneresse;
  Now seestow not this fool of fantasye
  Peyneth hir on ladyes for to lye?
  Awey,' quod he, 'ther Ioves yeve thee sorwe!                         1525
  Thou shalt be fals, paraunter, yet to-morwe!

  219. As wel thou mightest lyen on Alceste,
  That was of creatures, but men lye,
  That ever weren, kindest and the beste.
  For whanne hir housbonde was in Iupartye                             1530
  To dye him-self, but-if she wolde dye,
  She chees for him to dye and go to helle,
  And starf anoon, as us the bokes telle.'

  220. Cassandre goth, and he with cruel herte
  For-yat his wo, for angre of hir speche;                             1535
  And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte,
  As though al hool him hadde y-mad a leche.
  And day by day he gan enquere and seche
  A sooth of this, with al his fulle cure;
  And thus he dryeth forth his aventure.                               1540

  221. Fortune, whiche that permutacioun
  Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed
  Through purveyaunce and disposicioun
  Of heighe Iove, as regnes shal ben flitted
  Fro folk in folk, or whan they shal ben smitted,                     1545
  Gan pulle awey the fetheres brighte of Troye
  Fro day to day, til they ben bare of Ioye.

  222. Among al this, the fyn of the parodie
  Of Ector gan approchen wonder blyve;
  The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie,                             1550
  And shapen hadde a mene it out to dryve;
  Ayeins which fate him helpeth not to stryve;
  But on a day to fighten gan he wende,
  At which, allas! he caughte his lyves ende.

  223. For which me thinketh every maner wight                         1555
  That haunteth armes oughte to biwayle
  The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;
  For as he drough a king by thaventayle,
  Unwar of this, Achilles through the mayle
  And through the body gan him for to ryve;                            1560
  And thus this worthy knight was brought of lyve.

  224. For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,
  Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;
  And namely, the sorwe of Troilus,
  That next him was of worthinesse welle.                              1565
  And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,
  That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,
  Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste.

  225. But natheles, though he gan him dispeyre,
  And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe,                             1570
  Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeyre.
  And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe
  To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe.
  And in his herte he wente hir excusinge,
  That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.                                 1575

  226. And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete
  Him-selven lyk a pilgrim to disgyse,
  To seen hir; but he may not contrefete
  To been unknowen of folk that weren wyse,
  Ne finde excuse aright that may suffyse,                             1580
  If he among the Grekes knowen were;
  For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.

  227. To hir he wroot yet ofte tyme al newe
  Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slouthe,
  Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe,                           1585
  She wolde come ayein and holde hir trouthe.
  For which Criseyde up-on a day, for routhe,
  I take it so, touchinge al this matere,
  Wrot him ayein, and seyde as ye may here.

  228. 'Cupydes sone, ensample of goodlihede,                          1590
  O swerd of knighthod, sours of gentilesse!
  How mighte a wight in torment and in drede
  And helelees, yow sende as yet gladnesse?
  I hertelees, I syke, I in distresse;
  Sin ye with me, nor I with yow may dele,                             1595
  Yow neither sende ich herte may nor hele.

  229. Your lettres ful, the papir al y-pleynted,
  Conseyved hath myn hertes piëtee;
  I have eek seyn with teres al depeynted
  Your lettre, and how that ye requeren me                             1600
  To come ayein, which yet ne may not be.
  But why, lest that this lettre founden were,
  No mencioun ne make I now, for fere.

  230. Grevous to me, god woot, is your unreste,
  Your haste, and that, the goddes ordenaunce,                         1605
  It semeth not ye take it for the beste.
  Nor other thing nis in your remembraunce,
  As thinketh me, but only your plesaunce.
  But beth not wrooth, and that I yow biseche;
  For that I tarie, is al for wikked speche.                           1610

  231. For I have herd wel more than I wende,
  Touchinge us two, how thinges han y-stonde;
  Which I shal with dissimulinge amende.
  And beth nought wrooth, I have eek understonde,
  How ye ne doon but holden me in honde.                               1615
  But now no fors, I can not in yow gesse
  But alle trouthe and alle gentilesse.

  232. Comen I wol, but yet in swich disioynte
  I stonde as now, that what yeer or what day
  That this shal be, that can I not apoynte.                           1620
  But in effect, I prey yow, as I may,
  Of your good word and of your frendship ay.
  For trewely, whyl that my lyf may dure,
  As for a freend, ye may in me assure.

  233. Yet preye I yow on yvel ye ne take,                             1625
  That it is short which that I to yow wryte;
  I dar not, ther I am, wel lettres make,
  Ne never yet ne coude I wel endyte.
  Eek greet effect men wryte in place lyte.
  Thentente is al, and nought the lettres space;                       1630
  And fareth now wel, god have you in his grace!
                               LA VOSTRE C.'

  234. This Troilus this lettre thoughte al straunge,
  Whan he it saugh, and sorwefully he sighte;
  Him thoughte it lyk a kalendes of chaunge;
  But fynally, he ful ne trowen mighte                                 1635
  That she ne wolde him holden that she highte;
  For with ful yvel wil list him to leve
  That loveth wel, in swich cas, though him greve.

  235. But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste,
  For any thing, men shal the sothe see;                               1640
  And swich a cas bitidde, and that as faste,
  That Troilus wel understood that she
  Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be.
  And fynally, he woot now, out of doute,
  That al is lost that he hath been aboute.                            1645

  236. Stood on a day in his malencolye
  This Troilus, and in suspecioun
  Of hir for whom he wende for to dye.
  And so bifel, that through-out Troye toun,
  As was the gyse, y-bore was up and doun                              1650
  A maner cote-armure, as seyth the storie,
  Biforn Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,

  237. The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius,
  Deiphebe it hadde y-rent from Diomede
  The same day; and whan this Troilus                                  1655
  It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,
  Avysing of the lengthe and of the brede,
  And al the werk; but as he gan biholde,
  Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde,

  238. As he that on the coler fond with-inne                          1660
  A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe
  That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,
  In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe;
  And she him leyde ayein hir feyth to borwe
  To kepe it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste,                            1665
  His lady nas no lenger on to triste.

  239. He gooth him hoom, and gan ful sone sende
  For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,
  And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,
  Compleyninge of hir hertes variaunce,                                1670
  His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce;
  And after deeth, with-outen wordes more,
  Ful faste he cryde, his reste him to restore.

  240. Than spak he thus, 'O lady myn Criseyde,
  Wher is your feyth, and wher is your biheste?                        1675
  Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,' he seyde;
  'Of Diomede have ye now al this feste!
  Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste,
  That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,
  That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!                           1680

  241. Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
  Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this,
  That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;
  Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis,
  So cruel wende I not your herte, y-wis,                              1685
  To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe
  Is now for-doon, and that is al my routhe.

  242. Was ther non other broche yow liste lete
  To feffe with your newe love,' quod he,
  'But thilke broche that I, with teres wete,                          1690
  Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me?
  Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye
  But for despyt, and eek for that ye mente
  Al-outrely to shewen your entente!

  243. Through which I see that clene out of your minde                1695
  Ye han me cast, and I ne can nor may,
  For al this world, with-in myn herte finde
  To unloven yow a quarter of a day!
  In cursed tyme I born was, weylaway!
  That ye, that doon me al this wo endure,                             1700
  Yet love I best of any creature.

  244. Now god,' quod he, 'me sende yet the grace
  That I may meten with this Diomede!
  And trewely, if I have might and space,
  Yet shal I make, I hope, his sydes blede.                            1705
  O god,' quod he, 'that oughtest taken hede
  To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punyce,
  Why niltow doon a vengeaunce on this vyce?

  245. O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste
  Me blamed hast, and wont art ofte up-breyde,                         1710
  Now maystow see thy-selve, if that thee liste,
  How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde!
  In sondry formes, god it woot,' he seyde,
  'The goddes shewen bothe Ioye and tene
  In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.                            1715

  246. And certaynly, with-oute more speche,
  From hennes-forth, as ferforth as I may,
  Myn owene deeth in armes wol I seche;
  I recche not how sone be the day!
  But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,                                    1720
  Whom I have ay with al my might y-served,
  That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved.'

  247. This Pandarus, that alle these thinges herde,
  And wiste wel he seyde a sooth of this,
  He nought a word ayein to him answerde;                              1725
  For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,
  And shamed, for his nece hath doon a-mis;
  And stant, astoned of these causes tweye,
  As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.

  248. But at the laste thus he spak, and seyde,                       1730
  'My brother dere, I may thee do no-more.
  What shulde I seyn? I hate, y-wis, Criseyde!
  And god wot, I wol hate hir evermore!
  And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore,
  Havinge un-to myn honour ne my reste                                 1735
  Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste.

  249. If I dide ought that mighte lyken thee,
  It is me leef; and of this treson now,
  God woot, that it a sorwe is un-to me!
  And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow,                                1740
  Right fayn wolde I amende it, wiste I how.
  And fro this world, almighty god I preye,
  Delivere hir sone; I can no-more seye.'

  250. Gret was the sorwe and pleynt of Troilus;
  But forth hir cours fortune ay gan to holde.                         1745
  Criseyde loveth the sone of Tydeus,
  And Troilus mot wepe in cares colde.
  Swich is this world; who-so it can biholde,
  In eche estat is litel hertes reste;
  God leve us for to take it for the beste!                            1750

  251. In many cruel batayle, out of drede,
  Of Troilus, this ilke noble knight,
  As men may in these olde bokes rede,
  Was sene his knighthod and his grete might.
  And dredelees, his ire, day and night,                               1755
  Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte;
  And alwey most this Diomede he soughte.

  252. And ofte tyme, I finde that they mette
  With blody strokes and with wordes grete,
  Assayinge how hir speres weren whette;                               1760
  And god it woot, with many a cruel hete
  Gan Troilus upon his helm to-bete.
  But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde,
  Of otheres hond that either deyen sholde.--

  253. And if I hadde y-taken for to wryte                             1765
  The armes of this ilke worthy man,
  Than wolde I of his batailles endyte.
  But for that I to wryte first bigan
  Of his love, I have seyd as that I can.
  His worthy dedes, who-so list hem here,                              1770
  Reed Dares, he can telle hem alle y-fere.

  254. Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe,
  And every gentil womman, what she be,
  That al be that Criseyde was untrewe,
  That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.                        1775
  Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;
  And gladlier I wol wryten, if yow leste,
  Penelopeës trouthe and good Alceste.

  255. Ne I sey not this al-only for these men,
  But most for wommen that bitraysed be                                1780
  Through false folk; god yeve hem sorwe, amen!
  That with hir grete wit and subtiltee
  Bitrayse yow! and this commeveth me
  To speke, and in effect yow alle I preye,
  Beth war of men, and herkeneth what I seye!--                        1785

  256. Go, litel book, go litel myn tregedie,
  Ther god thy maker yet, er that he dye,
  So sende might to make in som comedie!
  But litel book, no making thou nenvye,
  But subgit be to alle poesye;                                        1790
  And kis the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace
  Virgile, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, and Stace.

  257. And for ther is so greet diversitee
  In English and in wryting of our tonge,
  So preye I god that noon miswryte thee,                              1795
  Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge.
  And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe,
  That thou be understonde I god beseche!
  But yet to purpos of my rather speche.--

  258. The wraththe, as I began yow for to seye,                       1800
  Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere;
  For thousandes his hondes maden deye,
  As he that was with-outen any pere,
  Save Ector, in his tyme, as I can here.
  But weylaway, save only goddes wille,                                1805
  Dispitously him slough the fiers Achille.

  259. And whan that he was slayn in this manere,
  His lighte goost ful blisfully is went
  Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere,
  In convers letinge every element;                                    1810
  And ther he saugh, with ful avysement,
  The erratik sterres, herkeninge armonye
  With sownes fulle of hevenish melodye.

  260. And doun from thennes faste he gan avyse
  This litel spot of erthe, that with the see                          1815
  Enbraced is, and fully gan despyse
  This wrecched world, and held al vanitee
  To respect of the pleyn felicitee
  That is in hevene above; and at the laste,
  Ther he was slayn, his loking doun he caste;                         1820

  261. And in him-self he lough right at the wo
  Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste;
  And dampned al our werk that folweth so
  The blinde lust, the which that may not laste,
  And sholden al our herte on hevene caste.                            1825
  And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,
  Ther as Mercurie sorted him to dwelle.--

  262. Swich fyn hath, lo, this Troilus for love,
  Swich fyn hath al his grete worthinesse;
  Swich fyn hath his estat real above,                                 1830
  Swich fyn his lust, swich fyn hath his noblesse;
  Swich fyn hath false worldes brotelnesse.
  And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde,
  As I have told, and in this wyse he deyde.

  263. O yonge fresshe folkes, he or she,                              1835
  In which that love up groweth with your age,
  Repeyreth hoom from worldly vanitee,
  And of your herte up-casteth the visage
  To thilke god that after his image
  Yow made, and thinketh al nis but a fayre                            1840
  This world, that passeth sone as floures fayre.

  264. And loveth him, the which that right for love
  Upon a cros, our soules for to beye,
  First starf, and roos, and sit in hevene a-bove;
  For he nil falsen no wight, dar I seye,                              1845
  That wol his herte al hoolly on him leye.
  And sin he best to love is, and most meke,
  What nedeth feyned loves for to seke?

  265. Lo here, of Payens corsed olde rytes,
  Lo here, what alle hir goddes may availle;                           1850
  Lo here, these wrecched worldes appetytes;
  Lo here, the fyn and guerdon for travaille
  Of Iove, Appollo, of Mars, of swich rascaille!
  Lo here, the forme of olde clerkes speche
  In poetrye, if ye hir bokes seche.--                                 1855

  266. O moral Gower, this book I directe
  To thee, and to the philosophical Strode,
  To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to corecte,
  Of your benignitees and zeles gode.
  And to that sothfast Crist, that starf on rode,                      1860
  With al myn herte of mercy ever I preye;
  And to the lord right thus I speke and seye:

  267. Thou oon, and two, and three, eterne on-lyve,
  That regnest ay in three and two and oon,
  Uncircumscript, and al mayst circumscryve,                           1865
  Us from visible and invisible foon
  Defende; and to thy mercy, everichoon,
  So make us, Iesus, for thy grace digne,
  For love of mayde and moder thyn benigne! Amen.

NOTES TO BOETHIUS.


BOOK I.

METRE 1. In order to elucidate the English text, I frequently quote the
original Latin, usually from the text of T. Obbarius, Jena, 1843. See
further in the Introduction.

3. _rendinge_, Lat. 'lacerae'; rather rent, or tattered. The sense
'rending' occurs in Ovid, Met. viii. 880.

6. _that is to seyn._ The words in italics are not in the original, but
were added by Chaucer as explanatory. Throughout the treatise, I print all
such passages in italics.

8. _werdes_, 'weirds,' fate.

 'Gloria felicis olim uiridisque iuuentae
    Solantur maesti nunc mea fata senis.'

12. _slake_, better _slakke_; cf. Cant. Ta. E. 1849. _empted_, 'effeto.'
MS. C. has _emty_.

13. _in yeres ... swete_: 'dulcibus annis.'

14. _y-cleped_, invoked; 'uocata,' sc. 'mors.' Cf. Troilus, iv. 503.

16. _naiteth_, refuseth; 'negat.' Icel. _neita_, to say nay.

17. _lighte_, i.e. transitory; 'leuibus ... bonis.' The gloss 'sc.
temporels' (in A) gives the right sense. _sc._ = scilicet, namely; the form
_temporels_ is the French plural.

18, 19. _But now_:

 'Nunc quia fallacem mutauit nubila uultum,
    Protrahit ingratas impia uita moras.'

The translation _unagreable dwellinges_ is an unhappy one.

22. _in stedefast degree_, in a secure position; 'stabili ... gradu.'

With regard to the last sentence, Mr. Stewart remarks, in his essay on
Boethius, that Chaucer here 'actually reproduces the original Latin metre,'
i.e. a hexameter and pentameter. The true M. E. pronunciation must, for
this purpose, be entirely neglected; which amounts to saying that Chaucer
must have been profoundly unconscious of any such intention.

PROSE 1. 2. _and markede_: 'querimoniamque lacrimabilem stili officio
designarem.' Hence _markede_ is 'wrote down'; and _pointel_ refers to the
_stilus_. Cf. Som. Tale, D 1742. _with office_, by the use (of).

6. _empted_, exhausted; 'inexhausti uigoris.' Of course the woman here
described is _Philosophia_.

9. _doutous_; 'statura discretionis ambiguae.'

12. _heef_, heaved; A. S. _h[=o]f_. In Layamon, _hof_, _haf_, _heaf_. I put
_heef_ for _hef_, because the _e_ is long.

13. _so that_: 'respicientiumque hominum frustrabatur intuitum.'

14. _delye_ (so in both MSS.) = _deli-[=e]_, O. F. _deliè_ (see Cotgrave),
delicate, thin, slender, from Lat. _delicatus_, with the usual loss of _c_
between two vowels and before the accented syllable; Lat. 'tenuissimis
filis.'

After _crafte_ it would have been better to insert _and_; Lat.
'indissolubili_que_ materiâ.' But some MSS., including C., omit _que_.

18. _as it is wont_: 'ueluti fumosas imagines solet.'

21. _a Grekissh P_; i.e. [PI]. _a Grekissh T_; i.e. [THETA], not [TAU]; the
Greek [theta] being pronounced as _t_ in Latin. The reference is to [Greek:
philosophia praktikê kai theôrêtikê]; in Latin, Philosophia Actiua et
Contemplatiua; i. e. Practical (or Active) and Theoretical (or
Contemplative) Philosophy. This is the same distinction as that between the
_Vita Actiua_ and _Vita Contemplatiua_, so common in medieval literature;
see note (3) to the Sec. Non. Tale, G 87; and note to P. Plowman, B. vi.
251.

26. _corven_, cut, cut away pieces from; Lat. 'sciderant.'

33. _cruel_, i. e. stern; 'toruis.'

34. _thise comune_: 'has scenicas meretriculas.'

39. _no-thing fructefyinge_; 'infructuosis.' Hence we may perhaps prefer to
read _no-thing fructuous_, as in Caxton and Thynne.

41. _holden_: 'hominumque mentes assuefaciunt morbo, non liberant.'

45. _for-why_, because (very common); seldom interrogative.

47. _me_, from me; and, in fact, Caxton and Thynne read _from me_ or _fro
me_. The forms _Eleaticis_, &c. are due to the Lat. text--'Eleaticis atque
Academicis studiis.' He should rather have said--'scoles of Elea and of the
Academie.' The _Eleatici philosophi_ were the followers of Zeno of Elea
(Zeno Eleates, born about B. C. 488 at Elea (Velia) in Italy), and the
favourite disciple of Parmenides (who is expressly mentioned in Book iii.
pr. 12, l. 143). The Academic philosophers were followers of Plato.

49. _mermaidenes_; Lat. 'Sirenes,' Sirens; cf. N. P. Tale, B 4461, and
note.

_til it be at the laste_; a false translation. Rather _unto destruction_;
'usque in exitium.' But, instead of _exitium_, MS. C. has _exitum_.

55. _plounged_, drowned; 'mersa.' Cf. _dreint_, Met. 2, l. 1.

59. _ner_, nearer; comparative, not positive; 'propius.'

METRE 2. 2. _mintinge_, intending; 'tendit ... ire.' Still in use in
Cambridgeshire.

8. _sterres of the cold moon_: 'gelidae sidera lunae.' I suppose this means
the constellations seen by moonlight, but invisible in the day. The
expression _sidus lunae_, the moon's bright form, occurs in Pliny, Nat.
Hist. ii. 9. 6; but it is difficult to see how _sidera_ can have the same
sense, as some commentators say.

9. _recourses_, orbits; referring to the planets.

_y-flit_, moved or whirled along by their different spheres; alluding to
the old Ptolemaic system of astronomy, which supposed that each planet was
fastened to a revolving sphere, thus causing it to perform its orbit in a
certain time, varying in the case of each.

_this man_: 'Comprensam [sc. stellam] in numeris uictor habebat.'

16. _highteth_, adorns; 'ornet.' Prob. from the sb. _hight_, _hiht_ (A. S.
_hyht_), joy, delight.

17. _fleteth_, flows (i.e. abounds); 'grauidis influat uuis.'

20. _empted_: 'Nunc iacet effeto lumine mentis.'

22. _fool_, i.e. foolish, witless, senseless; 'stolidam.'

PROSE 2. 6. _armures_, i.e. defensive armour; 'arma.'

8. _in sikernesse_: 'inuicta te firmitate tuerentur.'

14. _litargie_; better _letargye_, i.e. lethargy. Cf. Troil. i. 730.

19. _yplyted_, pleated into a wrinkle; 'contracta in rugam ueste.'

METRE 3. 1. _discussed_, driven away; 'discussâ ... nocte.'

4. _clustred_; 'glomerantur'; or 'covered with clouds,' as Chaucer says.

5. _Chorus_, Corus, or Caurus, the north-west wind.

6. _ploungy_, stormy, rainy; 'nimbosis ... imbribus.'

8. _Borias_, Boreas, the north wind, from Thrace.

9. _caves_; better _cave_, as in Caxton and Thynne; Lat. 'antro.' _beteth_;
'uerberet'; hence Chaucer's gloss.

11. _y-shaken_, 'uibratus'; i.e. tremulous, sparkling.

PROSE 3. 2. _took_, drew in, received light; 'hausi caelum.'

4. _beholde_, the present tense; 'respicio.'

10. _norry_, pupil, lit. nourished one; 'alumne.'

11. _parten the charge_, share the burden.

15. _redoute my blame_, fear blame. _agrysen_, shudder.

16. _quasi diceret non_, as if she would say no; as if she expected the
answer no. This remark is often inserted by Chaucer.

19. _Plato_; B.C. 428-347. Before his time, Solon, Anaxagoras, and
Pythagoras all met with opposition. The fate of Socrates is well known.

21. _The heritage_: 'Cuius hereditatem cum deinceps Epicureum uulgus ac
Stoicum, ceterique pro sua quisque parte raptum ire molirentur, meque
reclamantem renitentemque uelut in partem praedae detraherent, uestem, quam
meis texueram manibus, disciderunt, abreptisque ab ea panniculis, totam me
sibi cessisse credentes abiere.'

38. _Anaxogore_, Anaxagoras, a Greek philosopher (B.C. 500-428); exiled
from Athens (B.C. 450).

39. _Zeno_; Zeno of Elea (see p. 420), born about B.C. 488, is said to have
risked his life to defend his country. His fate is doubtful.

40. _Senecciens_, apparently meant for 'the followers of Seneca.' The
original has: 'at Canios, at Senecas, at Soranos ... scire potuisti.'

_Canios_, the Canii; i. e. men like Canius. The constancy and death of
Julius Canius (or Canus) is related by Seneca, De Tranquillitate, cap. xiv.
Cf. Pr. iv. 131, and note, p. 424.

41. _Sorans_, the Sorani; men like Soranus. Soranus is mentioned in
Tacitus, Annal. xvi. 23. Caxton and Thynne read _Soranos_, as in the Latin
text.

42. _unsolempne_, uncelebrated; 'incelebris.'

49. _it is to dispyse_, it (the host) is to be despised.

53. _ententif_, busy about seizing useless baggage as spoil.

_sarpulers_, sacks made of coarse canvas; in Caxton, _sarpleris_;
'sarcinulas.' Cotgrave has: '_Serpillere_, a Sarpler, or Sarp-cloth, a
piece of course canvas to pack up things in.' Cf. mod. F. _serpillière_.

56. _palis_, also spelt _paleis_ (O. F. _palis_), lit. a palisading, or a
piece of strong paling, a rampart, used to translate Lat. _uallum_. When
spelt _paleis_, it must not be confused with _paleis_, a palace.

METRE 4. 3. _either fortune_, good fortune or bad.

5. _hete_: 'Versum funditus excitantis aestum.' I suppose that _aestum_ is
rather 'surge' than 'heat' here. See Met. vii. below, l. 3.

6. _Vesevus_, 'Veseuus'; the same as Vesuvius; cf. Vergil, Georg. ii. 224.

7. _wrytheth_, writhes out, throws forth wreaths of smoke. Here the old
printed editions by Caxton and Thynne, as well as MS. Ii. 1. 38, happily
restore the text; Lat. 'Torquet.'

8. Caxton and Thynne have _thonder-leyte_, which is perhaps better. MS. Ii.
1. 38 has _thonder leit_.

13. _stable of his right_: 'stabilis, suique iuris.'

PROSE 4. 2. _Artow lyk_. The original is partly in Greek. 'An [Greek: onos
luras]?' Some MSS. have: 'Esne [Greek: onos pros luran]?' And MS. C. has:
'Esne asinus ad liram?' In an edition of Boethius by Renatus Vallinus,
printed in 1656, I find the following note: 'Ut et omnes veteres scripsere,
Varro in satyra quæ Testamentum inscribitur apud Agellium, lib. iii. cap.
xvi: _Ii_ liberi, _si erunt_ [Greek: onoi luras], _exheredes sunto_. Suidas
ex Menandro, Lucianus, Martian. Capella, lib. viii., atque alii quos refert
Erasmus, in eo adagio. Imo et apud Varronem id nominis satyra extitit.' It
has clearly a proverbial reference to dullness of perception. Ch. quotes it
again in his Troilus, i. 731, where he so explains it.

3. _why spillestow teres_, why do you waste tears; 'Quid lacrimis manas?'
After these words occur, in the original, four Greek words which Chaucer
does not translate, viz.: [Greek: Exauda, mê keuthe noô]: i. e. speak out,
do not hide them in your mind; quoted from Homer, Iliad i. 363.

With lines 3 and 4 compare Troilus, i. 857.

7. _by him-self_, in itself; 'per se.' Alluding to 'sharpnesse,' i. e.
'asperitas.'

15. _enformedest_, didst conform; 'formares.'

17. _ordre of hevene_; 'ad caelestis ordinis exemplar.' This refers to the
words of Plato just at the end of the 9th book of The Republic: [Greek: en
ouranô isôs paradeigma anakeitai.] Cf. also the last lines of Book II of
the present treatise.

18. _confermedest_ (MS. A, _enfourmedist_), didst confirm; 'sanxisti.' The
reading _conformedest_ evidently arose from confusion with _enformedest_
above, in l. 15.

19. _mouth of Plato_; referring to Book V (473 D) of the Republic: [Greek:
ean mê, ê hoi philosophoi basileusôsin en tais polesin, ê hoi basilês te
nyn legomenoi ki dynastai philosophêsôsi gnêsiôs te kai hikanôs, kai touto
eis tauton xympesê, dynamis te politikê kai philosophia; tôn de nyn
poreuomenôn chôris eph' hekateron hai pollai physeis ex anankês
apokleisthôsin, ouk esti kakôn paula ... tais polesi; dokô de, oude tô
anthrôpinô genei.]

24. _the same Plato_; in the 6th Dialogue on the Republic.

25. _cause_, reason; 'caussam.' _wyse_, i.e. '_for_ wise men.'

27. _felonous tormentours citizenes_, citizens who are wicked and
oppressive; the substantives are in apposition.

33. _knowinge with me_, my witnesses; 'mihi ... conscii.'

36. _discordes ... preyeres_; 'inexorabilesque discordiae.'

37. _for this libertee_, &c.; 'et quod conscientiae libertas habet.'

41. _Conigaste_, Conigastus, or Cunigastus; mentioned in Cassiodorus,
Epist. lib. viii. ep. 28. The facts here referred to are known only from
the present passage.

_prospre fortunes_ translates 'fortunas' simply; it seems to mean 'success'
or 'well-being.'

43. _Trigwille_, Triguilla; 'regiae praepositum domus.'

45. _auctoritee_; 'obiecta periculis auctoritate protexi.'

52. _cariages_, taxes; 'uectigalibus.' See a similar use in the Pers. Tale,
I 752, and note.

59. _inplitable_, intricate: 'inexplicabilis.' _coempcioun_, an imposition
so called; see Chaucer's explanation below, in l. 64. In Greek, [Greek:
synônê].

61. _Campaigne_, Campania, in Italy, _provost_; 'praefectum praetorii.'

64-67. See the footnote. I have here transposed this gloss, so as to make
it _follow_, instead of _preceding_, the mention of _coempcioun_ in the
text.

68. _Paulin_, Decius Paulinus, consul in 498; mentioned in Cassiodorus,
Epist. lib. i. epist. 23, lib. iii. epist. 29.

69. _houndes_; 'Palatini canes.'

73. _Albin_, perhaps Decius Albinus, to whom Theodoric addressed a letter
preserved in Cassiodorus, lib. iv. ep. 30. See l. 156 below.

75. _Ciprian_, Cyprian. We know something of him from two letters in
Cassiodorus, Epist. v. 40, 41. Theodoric esteemed him highly. See a
discussion of his career in H. F. Stewart's Essay on Boethius, pp. 42-52.

78. _to hem-ward_, i.e. for the benefit of the officers around me; 'mihi
... nihil apud aulicos, quo magis essem tutior, reseruaui.'

81. _Basilius_. Not much is known of him; see H. F. Stewart, as above, p.
48.

82. _compelled_, i.e. bribed to accuse me. _for nede of foreine moneye_:
'alienae aeris necessitate.'

84. _Opilion_, Opilio; the Opilio mentioned in Cassiodorus, lib. v. epist.
41, and lib. viii. epist. 16, and brother of the Cyprian mentioned above,
l. 75. His father's name was Opilio likewise.

89. _aperceived_, made known. _the king_, i.e. Theodoric, king of Italy for
33 years, A.D. 493-526. His reign was, on the whole, good and glorious, but
he committed the great crime of putting to death both Boethius and his aged
father-in-law Symmachus, for which he afterwards expressed his deep
repentance. See Gibbon's Roman Empire. The chief record of his reign is in
the collection of twelve books of public epistles composed in his name by
Cassiodorus. The seat of his government was Ravenna, as mentioned below.

93. _lykned_; rather, _added_; Lat. 'posse _adstrui_ uidetur.'

95-194. See a translation into modern English of the whole of this passage,
in H. F. Stewart's Essay, pp. 37-41.

101. _axestow in somme_, if you ask particularly; 'summam quaeris?'

106, 107. _forsake_, deny. _have wold_, have willed, did wish.

109. _and that I confesse_. Here Chaucer's version seems to be quite at
fault. 'At uolui, nec unquam uelle desistam. Fatebimur? [MS. C. Et
fatebimur.] Sed impediendi delatoris opera cessabit.'

113. _by me_, with regard to me; 'de me.'

117. _Socrates_; in Plato's Republic, Book VI: [Greek: tên apseudeian ...
misein, tên d' alêtheian stergein] (485 C).

120. _preisen_, appraise, judge of: 'aestimandum.'

131. _Canius_, better _Canus_, i.e. 'Julius Canus, whose philosophic death
is described by Seneca, De Tranquillitate Animi, cap. xiv.'--Gibbon. He has
already been mentioned above, Prose iii. l. 40.

132. _Germeynes sone_, the son of Germanicus. This Gaius Cæsar is better
known as Caligula, the emperor who succeeded Tiberius.

143. _famileres_, friends, i.e. disciples, viz. Epicurus, in the De Ira
Divina, cap. xiii (Stewart).

154. _Verone_, Verona; next to Ravenna, the favourite residence of
Theodoric.

156. _his real maiestee_, high treason, lit. 'his royal majesty'; Lat.
'maiestatis crimen.' The king was intent upon repressing all freedom of
speech.

167. _submittede_, subdued: 'summitteret.'

171. _present_, i.e. he would, even in such a case, have been allowed to
appear in his defence, would have been called upon to confess his crime,
and would have been condemned in a regular manner.

173. _fyve hundred_, nearly 500 miles. Boethius was imprisoned in a tower
at Pavia.

176. _as who seith, nay_; i.e. it is said ironically. The senate well
deserve that no one should ever defend them as I did, and be convicted for
it.

181. _sacrilege_; glossed _sorcerie_: 'sacrilegio.' Sorcery or magic is
intended. 'At the command of the barbarians, the occult science of a
philosopher was stigmatised with the names of sacrilege and
magic.'--Gibbon. See below, l. 196.

186. _Pictagoras_, Pythagoras. The saying here attributed to him is given
in the original in Greek--[Greek: hepou theô]. Some MSS. add the gloss, _i.
deo non diis seruiendum_. MS. C. has: _deo et non diis sacrificandum_.

188. _I_, i. e. for me. A remarkable grammatical use.

190. _right clene_: 'penetral innocens domus.'

193. _thorugh_, i. e. for. Caxton and Thynne read _for_.

195. _feith_: 'de te tanti criminis fidem capiunt.'

198. _it suffiseth nat only ... but-yif_, this alone is insufficient ...
unless thou also, &c. _of thy free wille_: 'ultro.'

212. _good gessinge_, high esteem: 'existimatio bona.'

215. _charge_, burden, load: 'sarcinam.'

219. _by gessinge_, in men's esteem: 'existimatione.'

223. _for drede_: 'nostri discriminis terrore.'

METRE 5. 1. _whele_, sphere: 'orbis.' Not only were there seven spheres
allotted to the planets, but there was an eighth larger sphere, called the
sphere of fixed stars, and a ninth 'sphere of first motion,' or _primum
mobile_, which revolved round the earth once in 24 hours, according to the
Ptolemaic astronomy. This is here alluded to. God is supposed to sit in an
immoveable throne beyond it.

3. _sweigh_, violent motion; the very word used in the same connexion in
the Man of Lawes Tale, B 296; see note to that passage.

4. _ful hornes_, i. e. her horns filled up, as at full moon, when she meets
'with alle the bemes' of the Sun, i. e. reflects them fully.

7. _derke hornes_, horns faintly shining, as when the moon, a thin
crescent, is near the sun and nearly all obscured.

 'The bente mone with hir hornes pale;' Troil. iii. 624.

9. _cometh eft ayein hir used cours_, returns towards her accustomed
course, i. e. appears again, as usual, as a morning-star, in due course. I
think the text is incorrect; for _cometh_ read _torneth_, i. e. turns. Lat.
text: 'Solitas iterum mutet habenas.' The planet Venus, towards one
apparent extremity of her orbit, follows the sun, as an evening-star; and
again, towards the other apparent extremity, precedes it as a morning-star.
So Cicero, De Nat. Deorum, ii. 20. 53: 'dicitur Lucifer, cum antegreditur
solem, cum subsequitur autem, Hesperus.'

11. _restreinest_, shortenest; the sun's apparent course being shorter in
winter. Lat. 'stringis.'

13. _swifte tydes_, short times; viz. of the summer nights.

19. _Arcturus_, [alpha] Boötis, in the sign Libra; conspicuous in the
nights of spring.

20. _Sirius_, [alpha] Canis Maioris, or the Dog-star, in the sign of
Cancer; seen before sun-rise in the so-called dog-days, in July and August.
It was supposed that the near approach of Sirius to the Sun caused great
heat.

21. _his lawe_, i.e. '_its_ law'; and so again in _his propre_.

28. _on._ Caxton and Thynne rightly read _on_.

29. _derke derknesses_, obscure darkness: 'obscuris ... tenebris.' Not a
happy expression.

31. _covered and kembd_: 'compta.' Cf. _kembde_ in Squi. Ta. F 560.

37. _erthes_, lands; the pl. is used, to translate 'terras.'

41. _bonde_, i.e. the chain of love; see Bk. ii. Met. 8. l. 15.

PROSE 5. 1. _borken out_, barked out; 'delatraui.' MS. A. changes _borken_
into _broken_. The glossaries, &c., all seem to miss this excellent example
of the strong pp. of _berken_. _Borken_ appears as a pt. t. pl. in the King
of Tars, l. 400. The A.S. pp. _borcen_ appears in the A.S. Leechdoms, ed.
Cockayne, i. 170, l. 17.

14. _oo ... king._ The original is in Greek--[Greek: heis koiranos estin,
heis basileus]: quoted from Homer, Iliad, ii. 204, with the change from
[Greek: estô] to [Greek: estin].

18, 19. _thy citee_, i.e. the city of heaven; note the context.

22. _palis_, paling, rampart; 'uallo.' Clearer than _paleis_, as in A,
which might mean palace; but both spellings occur in French.

25. _face_ (facies), the look of this prison.

31. _in comune good_, for the common good: 'in commune bonum.'

34. _thinges ... aposed_, accusations; 'delatorum.'

45. _thy wode Muse_: 'Musae saeuientis'; cf. Met. 5 above, l. 22.

51. _thilke passiouns_: 'ut quae in tumorem perturbationibus influentibus
induruerunt.'

54. _by an esier touchinge_ refers to the preceding _mowen ... softe_:
'tactu blandiore mollescant.'

METRE 6. This Metre refers to the necessity of doing everything in its
proper season.

2. 'When the sun is in Cancer'; i.e. in the month of June.

4. _lat him gon_, let him go and eat acorns.

6. _whan the feld_: 'Cùm saeuis Aquilonibus Stridens campus inhorruit.'
_Chirkinge_, hoarse, rustling; alluding to the rustling of frozen grass in
a high wind.

15. _And forthy_: 'Sic quod praecipiti uiâ Certum deserit ordinem, Laetos
non habet exitus.'

PROSE 6. 10. _by fortunous fortune_: 'fortuitis casibus.' Not well
expressed.

14. _the same ... thou_, thou didst sing the same thing. See Met. v. 22.

17. _owh!_ an exclamation of astonishment: Lat. 'papae.'

18. _why that thou_: 'cur in tam salubri sententiâ locatus aegrotes.'

20. _I not ... what_: 'nescio, quid abesse coniecto.'

22. _with whiche governailes_, by what sort of government.

28. _the strengthe_, the strength of the gaping stockade discloses an
opening: 'uelut hiante ualli robore.' The corruption of _chyning_ to
_schynyng_ in MS. A. makes sad nonsense of the passage.

42. _they may nat al_: 'sibique totum extirpare non possint.'

55. _or elles the entree_: 'uel aditum reconciliandae sospitatis inueni.'

56. _For-why, for_, Because, since. _for-thy_, therefore.

64. _the auctor ... of hele_: 'sospitatis auctori.'

65. _norisshinges_; perhaps better _norisshing_, as in Caxton and Thynne;
'fomitem,' i. e. furtherance.

71. _faster_, firmer, stronger: 'firmioribus.'

76. _to maken thinne and wayk_: 'attenuare.'

77. _meneliche_, moderate: 'mediocribus.'

METRE 7. 1. _yeten a-doun_, pour down; 'fundere.' Not _geten_, as in A.

2. _trouble_, turbid; 'Turbidus Auster.'

3. _medleth the hete_: 'Misceat aestum.' See above, Met. iv. l. 5.

5. _clere as glas_; cf. Knight's Tale, A 1958.

_withstande_: 'Mox resoluto Sordida caeno, Visibus obstat.'

7. _royleth_, wanders; 'uagatur.' Not 'rolls.'

11. _holden_, keep to; cf. 'Hold the hye wey'; Truth, l. 20. _weyve_:
'Gaudia pelle, Pelle timorem; Spemque fugato.'


BOOK II.

PROSE 1. 13. _to begyle_; copied in Troil. iv. 2, 3:--

       '---- y-thonked be Fortune,
  That semeth trewest whan she wol bigyle.'

22. _myn entree_: 'de nostro adyto.' But Chaucer has translated 'adyto' as
if it were 'aditu.' He translates _aditum_ by _entree_ in Bk. i. Pr. 6, l.
55. _Adyto_ is 'sanctuary.'

28. _Com_, i. e. let (it) come; imperative: 'Adsit igitur rhetoricae
suadela dulcedinis.'

32. _moedes_, moods, strains; 'modos.' _prolaciouns_, utterances.

35. Compare Chaucer's poem on Fortune; and see the long note at the
beginning of the Notes to that poem.

45. _use hir maneres_; rather, make the best of her conduct: 'utere
moribus.' _agrysest_, shudderest at, dreadest.

48. _She hath forsaken_: 'Reliquit enim te, quam non relicturam nemo umquam
poterit esse securus.'

51. The MSS. usually agree in this clause. Chaucer's gloss is due to an
obscure note in MS. C., viz. 'vel quam non relictam, secundum alios
libros.' Other notes occur there, but do not help us.

68. _floor_: 'intra fortunae aream.' We say 'area' or 'domain.'

77. _amonges_, at various times, from time to time, now and then; see New
E. Dict., s.v. _Among_, B. 2.

83. _cesede_, would cease; copied in Troil. i. 848:--

 'For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,
  Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be.'

METRE 1. 3. _Eurype_, Euripus; a narrow channel, with a strong current;
especially that between Boeotia and Euboea. This use of the word is here
seen to be far older in English than the quotation from Holland's Pliny in
the New E. Dict.

8. _so hard_: 'Ultroque gemitus, dura quos fecit, ridet.'

9. _laugheth_, laughs at; 'ridet.' It is impossible to accept the reading
_lyssheth_ in C. There seems to be no such word. It probably arose from the
attempt of the scribe to represent the guttural sound of _gh_, because we
actually find him writing _neysshebour_ for _neighbour_ twice, viz. in Bk.
ii. Pr. 3. 24, and in Pr. 7. 57. This passage is imitated in Troil. iv. 7:
'Than laugheth she and maketh him the mowe.'

PROSE 2. 1. Compare Chaucer's 'Fortune'; l. 25, &c.

4. _every-dayes_, daily: 'cottidianis querelis.'

37. _I torne_: 'Rotam uolubili orbe uersamus.'

39. _Worth up_, climb up: 'Ascende.' Cf. P. Plowman, B. vii. 91; Wars of
Alexander, 2878, 2973.

42. _Cresus_, Croesus; see note to Monk. Tale, B 3917.

47. _Perciens_, Persians. But Chaucer is here wrong. The Lat. text has
'Persi regis,' i. e. king Perseus. Perseus, or Perses III, was the last
king of Macedonia, who was defeated by L. Æmilius Paulus in a decisive
battle fought near Pydna, in June, B.C. 168. 'When brought before Æmilius
[here, Paulus], he is said to have degraded himself by the most abject
supplications; but he was treated with kindness by the Roman general;'
Smith, Class. Dict. See Livy, xl. 57; xli. 53; xliv. 32; &c.; Plutarch,
Life of Æmilius.

51. _Tragedie._ Cf. the definition in the Monk. Prol. B 3163; and note to
Anelida, 320.

53. _in Greke._ These two words are not in the original, but the following
quotation is given in Greek: [Greek: duo tous pithous, ton men hena kakôn,
ton de heteron kalôn]. Some MSS. add: 'duo dolia quidem malum alterum
bonum.' From Homer, Iliad, xxiv. 527:

  [Greek: doioi gar te pithoi katakeiatai en Dios oudei,]
  [Greek: dôrôn, hoia didôsi, kakôn, heteros de eaôn.]

Cf. notes to Wyf of Bathes Prol. D 170, and to Leg. of Good Women, 195.

54. _in the entree_: 'in Iouis limine': [Greek: en Dios oudei].

61. _realme_: 'intra commune omnibus regnum locatus.'

METRE 2. 1. _hielde_, pour: 'Tantas fundat opes, nec retrahat manum Pleno
copia cornu.'

8. _as fool-large_, like one that is foolishly lavish: 'Multi prodigus
auri.'

11. _other gapinges_: 'Alios pandit hiatus.' Some MSS. have _Altos_, but
Chaucer evidently read _Alios_, as in MS. C.

13. _to any ... ende_; rather, 'within a prescribed boundary'; 'Certo fine
retentent.'

PROSE 3. 22. _princes._ These were, in particular, Festus and Symmachus.
Boethius married Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus. Hence the allusion
to his _fadres-in-lawe_ (socerorum) just below, in l. 26; where the right
sense is _parents-in-law_. See Stewart's Essay, p. 24.

23. _leef_: 'delectusque in affinitatem principum ciuitatis, quod
pretiosissimum propinquitatis genus est, priùs carus, quam proximus esse
coepisti.' Hence _the whiche thing_ really refers back to _affinitee_,
which is hardly obvious in the E. version.

40. _whan thou_: 'cùm in Circo duorum medius consulum circumfusae
multitudinis exspectationem triumphali largitione satiasti.'

43. _gave thou wordes_: 'Dedisti ... uerba fortunae.'

48. _privee_, a man of private station, not of noble rank: 'priuato.' The
reference is to the election of his two sons as consuls in one day.

55. _Art thou_: 'An tu in hanc uitae scenam nunc primum subitus hospesque
uenisti.' Thus _shadwe or tabernacle_ is meant to translate _scenam_.

60. _laste day_; quoted in Chaucer's 'Fortune,' l. 71; see note to the
line.

61. _and also_, i. e. even to such Fortune as abides and does _not_ desert
the man: 'fortunae ... etiam manentis.'

62. _thar recche_; it is absolutely necessary to insert _thee_ after
_thar_; i. e. And therefore, what, do you suppose, need you care? _yif
thou_, i. e. whether thou.

METRE 3. 10. _the fairnesse_: 'Iam spinis abeat decus.'

13. _over-whelveth_, turns over: 'Verso concitat aequore.' _whelveth_ is
the right form, as noted by Stratmann; it occurs in MS. Ii. 1. 38, and in
the black-letter editions. It occurs again in Palladius on Husbandry, i.
161: 'For harme ... may ... perchaunce the _overwhelve_,' i.e. for perhaps
harm may overthrow thee. And again, in the same, i. 781: '_overwhelve_ hit
upsodowne,' i.e. turn it (the land) right over.

16. _tomblinge_, fleeting, transitory; 'caducis.'

18. _nis_, is; we must disregard the second negative.

PROSE 4. 3. _ne be comen_, is not come; i.e. did not come. It refers to
past time.

5. _For in alle_: 'Nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus
est infortunii, fuisse felicem.' This famous sentence has been several
times copied. See, e.g., Troil. iii. 1625-8; Dante, _Inferno_, v. 121-3;
Tennyson, _Locksley Hall_, 76.

8. _But that thou_, i.e. 'but the fact that thou.' _abyest_, sufferest:
'falsae opinionis supplicium luis.'

12. _For al be it_: 'Nam si te hoc inane nomen fortuitae felicitatis
mouet.'

20. _Symacus_, Symmachus. There were several distinguished men of this
family. Q. Aurelius Symmachus was a statesman and author in the latter half
of the fourth century. The one here referred to is Q. Aurelius Memmius
Symmachus, who had been consul under Odoacer in 485, and was involved in
the fate of Boethius, being put to death by Theodoric in 525, shortly after
the execution of Boethius in 524. He had two daughters, Rusticiana and
Galla, of whom the former married Boethius. See Procopius, de Bello
Gothico, lib. i., and several Epistles in Cassiodorus, viz. lib. iv. epist.
22, 37, 66.

25. _thy wyf_; i. e. Rusticiana, daughter of Symmachus; for there is no
proof that Boethius was twice married (Stewart, p. 24). She survived the
capture of Rome by the Goths under Totila, A.D. 546. 'The riches of
Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus and widow of Boethius, had been
generously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine. But the
barbarians were exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people
to overthrow the statue of the great Theodoric; and the life of that
venerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had
not respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her
revenge.'--Gibbon, Rom. Empire, ch. 43.

31. _two sones_; the two spoken of just above (Pr. iii. l. 35), as being
both made consuls together. This was in 522.

_conseilours_, i.e. of consular rank: 'consulares.'

40. _thyne ancres_. Hence the line, 'Yit halt thyn ancre.' Fortune, l. 38.

52. _thy delices_: 'delicias tuas.' The sense here intended is
'effeminacy,' or 'unmanly weakness.'

56. _ful anguissous_, very full of anxieties: 'Anxia enim res,' &c.
Repeated in Troilus, iii. 816, q.v.

68. _for alwey_, &c. Very obscure. Chaucer seems to mean--'for always, in
every man's case, there is, in something or other, that which (if he has
not experienced it) he does not understand; or else he dreads that which he
has already experienced.' The Latin is clearer: 'inest enim singulis, quod
inexpertus ignoret, expertus exhorreat.'

79. _nothing [is] wrecched_. The insertion of _is_ completes the sense:
'adeo nihil _est_ miserum, nisi cùm putes.' Observe '_nis a wrecche_' in
Chaucer's own gloss (l. 81); and see l. 25 of 'Fortune.'

83. _by the agreabletee_, by means of the equanimity: 'aequanimitate
tolerantis.' Not having the word 'equanimity' at command, Chaucer
paraphrases it by 'agreeabletee or egalitee,' i. e. accommodating or
equable behaviour. Cf. l. 92.

86. _The swetnesse_, &c. Cf. Troilus, iii. 813-5; and Man of Lawes Tale, B
421-2, and note.

89. _withholden_, retained: 'retineri non possit.' _that_, so that.

107. _sheweth it wel_, it is plain: 'manifestum est.'

110. _either he woot_, &c.; copied in Troilus, iii. 820-833.

115. _lest he lese that ... it_, lest he lose that which. MS. A. _omits_
'it'; but the phrase is idiomatic.

119. _this is to seyn that men_, that is to say that, in such a case, men,
&c.

120. _lost_, loss. This form of the sb. occurs elsewhere; as in Gower, i.
147 (goth to _lost_); and in P. Plowman, C. vii. 275; &c. See Stratmann.

131. _it ne maketh_, it does not make men miserable.

METRE 4. 7. _lause_, loose; Icel. _lauss_: 'solutae.' Usually _loos_, as in
Cant. Ta. A 4064, 4352.

8. _forthy if thou_: 'Fugiens periculosam Sortem sedis amoenae, Humili
domum memento Certus figere saxo.' Chaucer's translation is hardly correct;
_sortem_ and _sedis_ must be taken in close connection. 'Avoiding the
perilous condition of a fair (and exposed) situation, take care to found
thy house securely on a low-lying (and sheltered) rock.'

12. _weleful_: 'Felix robore ualli Duces serenus aeuum.' _palis_, stockade,
rampart; as before, Bk. i. Pr. 3. 56, Pr. 5. 22.

PROSE 5. 10. _to hem that despenden it_; rather, by spending it; Lat.
'effundendo.' So again, in l. 11, _to thilke folke that mokeren it_ answers
to the Lat. gerund 'coaceruando.'

11. _mokeren it_, hoard it. Perhaps related to O.F. _mucier_; see
_Curmudgeon_ in my Etym. Dict. See _mokereres_, misers, below.

15. _stenteth to ben had_, ceases to be possessed: 'desinit possideri.'

16. _large_, lavish; 'largiendi usu desinit possideri.'

18. _as of that_, as regards that hoard.

19. _a voys al hool_, a voice not yet dispersed: 'uox ... tota.'

32. _yif it wanteth_, if it lacks: 'carens animae motu atque membrorum
compage.'

35. _of the laste_: 'postremae aliquid pulcritudinis.'  Perhaps it means
'of the lowest kind of beauty.' Mr. Stewart, in his Essay, p. 225, reads
_postremo_, for which I find _no_ authority. MS. C. has _postreme_.

36. _through the distinccioun_: 'suique distinctione.'

40. _Why sholde it nat_, &c. In some editions, this passage is not marked
as being assigned to Boethius. In others, it is.

85. _ostelments_, furniture, household goods: 'supellectilis.' O.F.
_ostillement_, _oustillement_, furniture; cf. mod. F. _outil_, a word of
doubtful origin. Cf. l. 94.

90. _subgit_; as if for 'suppositis'; but the Lat. text has 'sepositis,'
i.e. separate, independent.

92. _beest_, animal: 'diuinum merito rationis animal.'

97. _of the lowest_, &c., 'by means of vilest things.'

101. _yif that al_, &c., 'if all the good possessed is more valuable than
the thing possessing it.'

105. _and certes_: 'quod quidem haud immerito cadit.'

111. _it cometh_: 'it arises from some defect in them.'

121. _Gabbe I of this_, do I lie concerning this?

125. _weneth._ The texts have _and weneth_; but I suppress _and_ to make
sense, and to make the translation agree with the Latin. 'Atqui diuitiae
possidentibus persaepè nocuerunt, cùm pessimus quisque, eóque alieni magis
auidus, quidquid usquam auri gemmarumque est, se solum qui habeat
dignissimum putat.'

128. _way-feringe_; MS. A, _way-faryng_. Both forms, _feringe_ and
_faring(e)_ occur; see Stratmann. _Feringe_ = A. S. _f[=e]rende_, from the
weak verb _f[=e]ran_, to go, travel; whilst _faringe_ = A. S. _farende_,
from the strong verb _faran_, to go. _F[=e]ran_ (= _*f[=o]rian_) is
derived, with vowel-mutation, from the stem _*f[=o]r_, appearing in
_f[=o]r_, the pt. t. of _faran_.

130. _singe_, &c. Doubtless from Juvenal, Sat. x. 22; see Wyf of Bathes
Tale, D 1191, and the note.

METRE 5. Largely imitated in Chaucer's poem called 'The Former Age,' which
see. See also the Notes to the same.

5. _They ne coude_, they knew not how: 'Non Bacchica munera norant Liquido
confundere melle.'

6. _piment_, usually spiced wine; here, wine mixed with honey. See Rom. of
the Rose, 6027, and the note. _clarree_, wine mixed with honey and spices,
and then strained till it is clear; clarified wine. See Rom. of the Rose,
5967, 6026; Former Age, 16; Kn. Tale, A 1471. Chaucer uses these two words
here in conjunction, for the simple reason that he was thinking of the
parallel passage in the French Rom. de la Rose, which is imitated from the
present passage in Boethius. Ll. 8418-9 are:--

 'Et de l'iaue simple bevoient
  Sans querre _piment_ ne _claré_.'

7. _ne they coude_: 'Nec lucida uellera Serum Tyrio miscere ueneno.' Hence
the _Seriens_ are the _Seres_, or Chinese; and _the venim of Tyrie_ should
rather be _the venim of Tyre_, but Chaucer follows the adjectival form in
the original, both here and in Bk. iii. Met. 4, l. 2. _Venim_ is not the
right word here; 'ueneno' merely means 'dye.' The reference is to the
_murex_ or purple shell-fish. See Vergil, Aen. iv. 262: '_Tyrio_que ardebat
_murice_ laena'; and Georg. ii. 465: '_alba_ nec Assyrio _fucatur lana
ueneno_.'

13. _gest ne straungere_: 'hospes.' Cf. Former Age, 21.

17. _armures_, defensive armour: 'arma.' The usual reading is _arua_, i. e.
fields; but more than six MSS. have _arma_, and Chaucer's copy had the
same; as appears from MS. C.

18. _For wherto_: 'for to what purpose, or what sort of madness of enemies
would first take up arms, when they saw but cruel wounds (as the result)
and no rewards for the blood that was shed?'

22. _But the anguissous_: 'Sed saeuior ignibus Aetnae Feruens amor ardet
habendi.'

24. _Allas!_ &c. Cf. Former Age, 27-32. _the gobetes or the weightes of
gold_: 'Auri ... pondera.'

26. _He dalf_: 'Pretiosa pericula fodit.'

PROSE 6. 8. _the imperie of consulers_, consular rank: 'consulare
imperium.' The reference is to the creation of Decemviri; see Livy, iii.
32.

20. _so requerable_, in such request: 'expetibilis.'

29. _into the ... body_: 'in secreta quaeque.'

32. _the whiche I clepe_, by which I mean; so again below, l. 39.

35. _a thought_, a mind; 'mentem firma sibi ratione cohaerentem.'

36. _a free man_; Anaxarchus of Abdera, B.C. 323. The _tyraunt_ was
Nicocreon, king of Cyprus. See Valerius Maximus, iii. 3.

44. _But what_: 'Quid autem est, quod in alium quisquam facere possit, quod
sustinere ab alio ipse non possit?'

47. _Busirides_, Busiris (gen. case, _Busiridis_), a king of Egypt, who
sacrificed all strangers on his altars. But Hercules, coming to Egypt, slew
him and abolished the custom. See Vergil, Georg. iii. 5; Ovid, Tr. iii. 11.
39. In the Monkes Tale, B 3293, Chaucer calls him _Busirus_.

49. _Regulus_; M. Regulus, taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, B.C. 255.
The story of his embassy to Rome is well known.

63. _may I._ It is necessary to insert _I_ (only found in the black-letter
editions) to complete the sense. 'Quod quidem de cunctis fortunae muneribus
dignius existimari potest.'

71. _as of wil_, i.e. when it can: 'ultro.'

80. _reproeved_, disproved: 'redarguuntur.'

METRE 6. 2. _Nero._ Cf. Monkes Tale, B 3653-84.

4. _his brother_; Britannicus, poisoned by Nero; Tacitus, Annal. xiii. 16;
Suetonius, Nero, 33.

8. _domesman_, judge; see Monk. Ta. B 3680, and note.

15. _septem triones_, properly, the seven chief stars in the Lesser Bear;
also sometimes used of the seven bright stars in the Greater Bear. The
leading star in the Lesser Bear is the pole-star; and as that remains fixed
in the north, the whole constellation came to signify the north. Hence, in
the Monk. Ta. B 3657, we are told that Nero ruled over 'Both Est and West,
South and _Septemtrioun_'; see note to that line.

18. _Nothus_, Notus, the south wind; see below. _scorkleth_, scorches; MS.
A has _scorchith_. The Prompt. Parv. has: 'Scorkelyn, _ustulo_, _ustillo_';
and 'Scorklyd, _ustillatus_.' As Mr. Bradley notes, it is a variant of
_scorknen_ or _scorpnen_. The orig. Icel. verb is _skorpna_, to become
shrivelled, allied to _skorpinn_, shrivelled. This is a pp. form as if from
_*skerpa_, pt. t. _*skarp_; cf. _skera_, pt. t. _skar_, pp. _skorinn_. The
adj. _skarpr_ means 'sharp,' whence the weak verb _skerpa_, to sharpen. The
sense of the primitive verb _*skerpa_ was, doubtless, 'to cut'; and
_scorklen_ is, lit., 'to cause to be cut about,' when used as a transitive
verb; hence, 'to shrivel up,' from the appearance of plants 'cut' with
frost or parched with heat.

21. _Allas!_

 'Heu grauem sortem, quoties iniquus
  Additur saeuo gladius ueneno!'

More correctly, 'lordshippe to venimous crueltee.' MS. C has 'gladius, i.
potestas exercendi gladium'; and 'ueneno, i. venenose crudelitati.'

PROSE 7. 3. _I have wel desired_: 'materiam gerendis rebus optauimus, quo
ne uirtus tacita consenesceret.'

10. _drawen to governaunce_: 'allicere,' i. e. allure (simply).

18. _a prikke_, a point; cf. Parl. of Foules, 57; Troil. v. 1815; Ho. Fame,
907. From Ptolemy, Syntaxis, lib. i. cap. 6; cf. Macrobius, In Somnium
Scipionis, lib. ii. c. 9.

23. _Tholomee_, Ptolemy; viz. in the beginning of book ii. of his Megale
Syntaxis. See the same in Pliny, Nat. Hist. ii. 68.

28. _wel unnethe_, scarcely, hardly at all: 'uix angustissima inhabitandi
hominibus area relinquetur.'

34. _And also sette_: 'Adde, quod hoc ipsum breuis habitaculi septum plures
incolunt nationes.'

38. _defaute ... marchaundise_; Lat. only: 'tum conmercii insolentia.'

41. _Marcus Tullius_, i.e. Cicero, in his Somnium Scipionis, which
originally formed part of the sixth book of the De Republica. See cap. vi.
of that work, and Note to Parl. Foules, 31.

43. _Caucasus_; mentioned again in the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 1140.

45. _Parthes_, Parthians.

59. _hath the wrecched_: 'scriptorum inops deleuit obliuio.'

69. _ended_: 'definitum.' We now say 'finite.'

73. _endeles_: 'interminabilem.' We now say 'infinite.'

77. _were thought_, were considered in comparison with eternity.

89. _This rather man_, this former man, the former.

95. _seyde_: 'Iam tandem, inquit, intelligis me esse philosophum? Tum ille
nimium mordaciter, Intellexeram, inquit, si tacuisses.' This story is
alluded to in Piers Plowman; see my note to that poem, C. xiv. 226.

108. _despyseth it_; cf. Troilus, v. 1821-7.

METRE 7. 1. _with overthrowing thought_: 'mente praecipiti.'

3. _shewinge_, evident, open to the view: 'Latè patentes ... plagas.'

7. _dedly_, mortal, perishable: 'mortali iugo.'

8. _ferne_, distant: 'remotos.' This is important, as settling the sense of
'ferne halwes' in the Prologue to the Tales, l. 14.

13. _Fabricius_, the conqueror of Pyrrhus; censor in B.C. 275. _Brutus_,
the slayer of Cæsar.

14. _Catoun_, Cato of Utica (B.C. 95-46).

17. _Liggeth_, lie ye; 'Iacetis.' The imperative mood.

20. _cruel_; Lat. 'sera,' which Chaucer has taken as 'seua.' 'Cum sera
uobis rapiet hoc etiam dies.' _thanne is_: 'Iam uos secunda mors manet.'

PROSE 8. 2. _untretable_, not to be treated with, intractable, inexorable:
'inexorabile.'

7. _unpleyten_, unplait, explain: 'explicare.'

17. _windinge._ Read _windy_, i.e. unstable; Lat. 'uentosam.' Caxton's
edition has _wyndy_, which proves the point. So also other old black-letter
editions.

23. _aspre_: 'haec aspera, haec horribilis fortuna.'

26. _visages_, faces. See Notes to the poem on Fortune.

METRE 8. 1. It begins 'Quòd mundus stabile fide Concordes uariat uices;
Quòd pugnantia semina Foedus perpetuum tenent.' The whole of this metre
reappears in Troilus, iii. 1744-1764.

6. _hath brought_, hath led in, introduced: 'duxerit.'

_greedy to flowen_; the Lat. text merely has _auidum_; 'Ut fluctus auidum
mare Certo fine coerceat.' The Lat. _fluctus_ answers to 'hise flodes.'

7. _ende_, boundary: 'fine.'

8. _termes or boundes_, borders: 'terminos.'

10. _Love_: 'Et caelo imperitans amor.' On this passage is founded one in
the Knightes Tale, A 2991-3.

11. _slakede_, were to relax. The last lines are:--

 'Et quam nunc socia fide Pulcris motibus incitant,
  Certent soluere machinam. Hic sancto populos quoque
  Iunctos foedere continet: Hic et coniugii sacrum
  Castis nectit amoribus: Hic fidis etiam sua
  Dictat iura sodalibus. O felix hominum genus,
  Si uestros animos amor, Quo caelum regitur, regat!'


BOOK III.

PROSE 1. 3. _streighte_, pp., i.e. stretched; 'adrectis ... auribus.' The
form _streight-e_ is plural.

6. _so_, i.e. so much. Better 'how much'; Lat. _quantum_.

8. _unparigal_, unequal; 'imparem.'

11. _nat only that_, it is not only the case that. It would be clearer if
_that_ were omitted.

12. _agrisen_, filled with dread; pp., with short _i_, of _agrysen_. Cf.
_agryseth_, Bk. i. Met. 6, l. 7.

15. _ravisshedest_, didst greedily receive; 'rapiebas.'

32. _for the cause of thee_, for thy sake; 'tui caussa.'

33. _but I wol_, &c.; 'sed quae tibi caussa notior est, eam prius designare
uerbis atque informare conabor.'

METRE 1. 2. _hook_, sickle; 'falce.'

4. _Hony_; cf. Troilus, i. 638, iii. 1219.

6. _Nothus_, Notus, the South wind. _ploungy_, stormy, rainy; 'imbriferos.'

9. _bigin_, do thou begin; imperative; 'incipe.'

PROSE 2. 2. _streite sete_, narrow (retired) seat; 'in angustam sedem.'

3. _cures_, endeavours; 'omnis mortalium cura.'

7. _over that_, beyond it; 'ulterius.'

8. _sovereyn good_; 'omnium summum bonorum.'

11. _out of ... good_; 'extrinsecus.'

28. _mesuren_, &c.; 'Plurimi uerò boni fructum gaudio laetitiâque
metiuntur.'

34. _is torned_; a bad translation of 'uersatur,' i.e. 'resides.'

38. _merinesse_, enjoyment; 'iocunditatis.'

50. _for which_, on which account; 'quare.'

55. _Epicurus._ See Cant. Tales, Prol. 336-8, where this is quoted; and see
Merch. Ta. E 2021; Troil. iii. 1691; 'Epicurus ... sibi summum bonum
uoluptatem esse constituit.'

57. _birefte awey._ But the Lat. text has precisely the opposite sense:
'quod caetera omnia iocunditatem animo uideantur adferre.' For _adferre_
[MS. C _afferre_], Chaucer has given us the sense of _auferre_.

58. _studies_, i.e. endeavours; 'studia.' _corage_; 'animus.'

59. _al be it_, &c.; 'et si caligante memoria.'

60. _not_, knows not; 'uelut ebrius, domum quo tramite reuertatur,
ignorat.' See Cant. Tales, A 1262.

67. _that ... it_: 'qui quod sit optimum, id etiam ... putant.'

75. _forsake_, deny; 'sequestrari nequit.'

77. _be anguissous_, i.e. 'be _neither_ full of anxiety.' The _neither_ is
implied in the following _ne_; 'non esse anxiam tristemque.' It is clearer
if we supply _nat_, as in the text.

83. _Than is it good_, then it is the _summum bonum_.

86. _lovinge_, as if translating _diligendo_, which occurs in many MSS.;
but the better reading is 'deligendo,' i.e. selecting.

METRE 2. 1. _with slakke ... strenges_; 'fidibus lentis.'

2. _enclineth and flitteth_; 'flectat.' _flitteth_ here means 'shifts.'

3. _purveyable_, with provident care; 'prouida.'

6. _of the contre of Pene_; 'Poeni leones'; lions of North Africa, supposed
to be extremely ferocious.

8. _sturdy_, cruel, hard; 'trucem ... magistrum.'

13. _and hir mayster_: 'Primusque lacer dente cruento Domitor rabidas
imbuit iras.'

15. _Iangelinge_, garrulous; 'garrula.' This passage is imitated twice in
the Cant. Tales, F 607-617, H 163-174.

17. _pleyinge bisinesse_; 'ludens cura.'

19. _agreables_; this form of the pl. adj. is only used in the case of
words of French origin. Examples are not very common; cf. _reverents_
below, Bk. iii. Met. 4, l. 6; and _delitables_, C. T. F 899.

26. _by privee path_, by an unseen route; 'secreto tramite.' Alluding to
the apparent passage of the sun below the horizon and, as it were,
underneath the world. Cf. Troil. iii. 1705.

27. _Alle thinges_: 'Repetunt proprios quaeque recursus.'

PROSE 3. 1. _beestes_, animals; 'animalia.' Chaucer always uses _beest_ for
'animal.'

15. _fals beautee_, a false beauty; 'falsa ... beatitudinis species.' But
'species' may simply mean 'semblance.'

17. After _axe_, Caxton and Thynne insert _the_, i.e. thee; 'te ipsum.'

24. _thee lakked_: 'uel aberat quod abesse non uelles, uel aderat quod
adesse noluisses.' This sentence much impressed Chaucer. He again recurs to
it in the Complaint to Pite, 99-104; Parl. Foules, 90, 91; and Complaint to
his Lady, 47-49. This fact helps to prove the genuineness of the last-named
poem.

36. _No._ Observe the use of _no_ after a sentence containing _nis nat_. If
there had been no negative in the preceding sentence, the form would have
been _Nay_. Such is the usual rule.

40, 41. _maken_, cause, bring it about. _bihighten_, promised.

48. _foreyne ... pletinges_; 'forenses querimoniae.' But _forenses_ means
'public.'

69. _be fulfild ... and axe any thing_; rather paraphrastic; 'aliquid
poscens opibus expletur.' _fulfild_ here means 'plentifully supplied,' not
'completely satisfied,' whereas in the very next line it means 'completely
satisfied.'

71. _I holde me stille, and telle nat_, I say nothing about; 'Taceo.' Seven
E. words for one of Latin.

74. _what may ... be_, why is it; 'quid est quod,' &c.

METRE 3. 1. After _river_, Caxton and Thynne insert _or a gutter_; Lat.
'gurgite.'

2. _yit sholde it never_. This gives quite a false turn to the translation,
and misses the sense intended. I quote the whole Metre.

 'Quamuis fluente diues auri gurgite
    Non expleturas cogat auarus opes,
  Oneretque baccis colla rubri litoris;
    Ruraque centeno scindat opima boue:
  Nec cura mordax deserit superstitem,
    Defunctumque leues non comitantur opes.'

3. _rede see_; lit. 'red shore.' However, the Red Sea is alluded to.
Chaucer's translation of _baccis_ by 'stones' is not happy; for 'pearls'
are meant. Cf. Horace, Epod. viii. 14; Sat. ii. 3. 241. Pliny praises the
pearls from the Red Sea; Nat. Hist. lib. xii. c. 18.

PROSE 4. 9. _postum_, short for _apostume_, i.e. imposthume. _boch_, botch,
pustule. Lat. _struma_. Catullus is the well-known poet, and the allusion
is to his lines addressed to himself (Carm. 52):--

 'Quid est, Catulle, quid moraris emori?
  Sella in curuli struma Nonius sedet.'

14. _Certes, thou_, &c. Rather involved. 'Tu quoque num tandem tot
periculis adduci potuisti, ut cum Decorato gerere magistratum putares, cùm
in eo mentem nequissimi scurrae delatorisque respiceres?' _With_ is used
for _by_: 'by so many perils' is intended. See Chaucer's gloss.

16. _Decorat_, Decoratus. He seems to have been in high favour with king
Theodoric, who wrote him a letter which is preserved in Cassiodorus, lib.
v. 31. It is clear that Boethius thought very ill of him.

32. _that he is despysed_, i.e. _because_ he is despised. The argument is,
that a wicked man seems the more wicked when he is despised by a very great
number of people; and if he be of high rank, his rank makes him more
conspicuous, and therefore the more generally contemned. The MSS. vary
here; perhaps the scribes did not see their way clearly. See the footnote.

35. _and ... nat unpunisshed_; 'Verùm non impunè.'

40. _comen by_, arise from; 'per has umbratiles dignitates non posse
contingere.' See Chaucer's Balade on Gentilesse, l. 5.

42. _many maner_, a mistranslation: 'Si quis multiplici consulatu functus.'

46. _to don his office_, to perform its function. Cf. Wyf of Bathes Tale, D
1144.

50. _that wenen_, i.e. (folk or people) who suppose.

56. _provostrie_, i.e. the prætorship; 'praetura.'

57. _rente_, income; 'et senatorii census grauis sarcina.'

58. _the office_; this alludes to the _Praefectus annonae_, once an
honourable title. It was borne by Augustus, when emperor.

64. _by the opinioun of usaunces_; 'opinione utentium.' Chaucer's phrase
seems to mean 'by estimation of the mode in which it is used.' He should
have written 'by the opinioun of hem that usen it.'

66. _of hir wille_, of their own accord (as it were); 'ultro.'

68. _what is it_; 'quid est, quòd in se expetendae pulcritudinis habeant,
nedum aliis praestent?'

METRE 4. Cf. Monkes Tale, B 3653-60.

2. _Tirie_, Tyre; lit. 'Tyrian,' the adjectival form; 'Tyrio superbus
ostro.' So above, Bk. ii. Met. 5, l. 8.

3. _throf he_, he flourished (lit. throve); 'uigebat.'

6. _reverents_, the pl. form of the adj. See above, Bk. iii. Met. 2, l. 19.
_unworshipful_, &c.; 'indecores curules.'

PROSE 5. 1. _regnes_, kingdoms; _familiaritees_, friendships.

2. _How elles_, why not? 'Quidni?' _whan_, whenever.

4. _kinges ben chaunged._ This is the subject of Chaucer's Monkes Tale.
Examples are certainly numerous. In the time of Boethius (470-524), they
were not wanting. Thus Basiliscus, emperor of the East, had a reign which
Gibbon describes as 'short and turbulent,' and perished miserably of hunger
in 476; and Odoacer was killed by Theodoric in 493; see Gibbon's History.

13. _upon thilke syde that_, on whichever side.

14. _noun-power ... undernethe_; 'impotentia subintrat.' _nounpower_, lack
of power, occurs in P. Plowman, C. xx. 292; see my note.

17. _A tyraunt_; Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in Sicily, who caused a
sword to be hung by a slender thread over the head of his favourite
Damocles, to teach him that riches could not make happy the man whose death
was imminent. See Cicero, Tuscul. v. 21. 6; Horace, Carm. iii. 1. 17;
Persius, Sat. iii. 40. And see Ch. Kn. Tale, A 2029.

27. _seriaunts_, serjeants (satellite), different from _servauntes_
(seruientium) below. The difference is one of use only; for the form
_seriaunt_, E. _serjeant_, represents the Lat. _seruientem_, whilst
_servaunt_, E. _servant_, represents the O. F. pres. part. of the O. F.
verb _servir_; which comes to much about the same thing.

30. _what_, why; _what ... anything_ answers to Lat. 'quid.'

33. _in hool_, &c., whether that power is unimpaired or lost; Lat.
'incolumis ... lapsa.'

34. _Nero_; see note to Monkes Tale, B 3685.

35. _Antonius_, a mistake for _Antoninus_, as in the Lat. text. By
Antoninus is meant the infamous emperor Caracalla, on whom Septimius
Severus had conferred the title of Antoninus. Papinianus was a celebrated
Roman jurist, who was put to death at the command of Caracalla; see Gibbon,
Roman Empire, ch. vi.

39. _Senek_, Seneca; see Tacitus, Annal. xiv.

41. _But whan_; 'Sed dum ruituros moles ipsa trahit, neuter, quod uoluit,
effecit.' I.e. neither Papinian nor Seneca found it possible to forego
their position.

48. _Certes, swiche folk_; see Monkes Ta. B 3434-5.

50. _pestilence_; see Merch. Ta. E. 1784, and 1793-4.

METRE 5. 1. For _corage_, Caxton and Thynne have _corages_, but this may be
an alteration due to the Latin which they quote as a heading: 'Qui se uolet
esse potentem, _Animos_,' &c.

5. _Tyle_; 'ultima Thule.' Supposed to be Iceland, or one of the Shetland
Islands.

PROSE 6. 3. _tragedies_; see note to Cant. Ta. B 3163.

3, 4. _O glorie._ The original has: [Greek: ô doxa doxa myrioisi dê brotôn,
ouden gegôsi bioton ônkôsas megan]. See Euripides, Andromache, 319. For
this, MS. C. gives, as the Latin equivalent--'o gloria, gloria, in milibus
hominum nichil aliud facta nisi auribus inflatio magna'; an interpretation
which Chaucer here follows.

24. _gentilesse._ See remarks (in the notes) on Chaucer's Balade of
Gentilesse.

METRE 6. 8. _For yif thou loke your_; the change from _thy_ to _your_ is
due to the Latin: 'Si promordia _uestra_ Auctoremque Deum _spectes_.'

9. _forlived_, degenerate; 'degener.' In Prose 6 (above), l. 37, _outrayen
or forliven_ translates 'degenerent.'

PROSE 7. 1. _delices_; 'uoluptatibus.' The MSS. so confuse the words
_delices_ and _delyts_ that it is hardly possible to say which is meant,
except when the Lat. text has _deliciae_. Both E. words seem to correspond
to _uoluptates_.

12. _Iolitee_: intended to translate 'lasciuiam,' a reading of some MSS.;
MS. C. has this reading, glossed 'voluptatem.' Most MSS. read _lacunam_,
i.e. void, want. _were_, would be; 'foret.'

14. _that children_: 'nescio quem filios inuenisse tortores.'

15. _bytinge_; 'mordax.' _anguissous_: 'anxium.'

16. _or_, ere; in fact, Caxton has _ere_, and Thynne, _er_.

18. _Euripidis_; in the gen. case, as in the Lat. text. The reference is to
Euripides, Andromache, 418: [Greek: pasi d' anthrôpois ar' ên psychê,
tekn'; hostis d' aut' apeiros ôn psegei, hêsson men algei, dystychôn d'
eudaimonei].

METRE 7. 3. _he fleeth_: 'Fugit et nimis tenaci Ferit icta corda morsu.' As
to the use of _flyes_ for 'bees,' see note to Parl. Foules, 353.

PROSE 8. 1. _that thise weyes_: 'quin hae ad beatitudinem uiae deuiae
quaedam sint.'

8. _supplien_, supplicate, beg: 'danti supplicabis.'

11. _awaytes_, snares: 'subiectorum insidiis obnoxius periculis
subiacebis.' _anoyously_; a mistranslation of 'obnoxius,'; see above.

12. _destrat_, distracted: 'distractus.'

16. _brotel_, brittle, frail: 'fragilissimae.'

28. _of the somer-sesoun_: 'uernalium.' So elsewhere, _somer-sesoun_ really
means the spring. Cf. P. Plowman, line 1.

_Aristotle._ The reference is not known; but the belief was common. It is
highly probable that the fable about the lynx's sharp sight arose from a
confusion with the sharp sight of Lynceus; and it is Lynceus who is really
meant in the present passage; 'Lynceis oculis.' Cf. Horace, Sat. i. 2. 90:

         --'ne corporis optima Lyncei
  Contemplere oculis.'

METRE 8. 5. _ginnes_, snares: 'laqueos.'

7. _Tyrene_; 'Tyrrhena ... uada'; see Vergil, Aen. i. 67.

14. _echines_: 'uel asperis Praestent echinis litora.'

PROSE 9. 10. _thorugh a litel clifte_: 'rimulâ.'

14. _misledeth it and transporteth_: 'traducit.'

16. _Wenest thou_: 'An tu arbitraris, quod nihilo indigeat, egere
potentia?'

38. _Consider_: 'Considera uero, ne, quod nihilo indigere, quod
potentissimum, quod honore dignissimum esse concessum est, egere
claritudine, quam sibi praestare non possit, atque ob id aliqua ex parte
uideatur abiectius.'

53. _This is a consequence_: 'Consequitur.'

69. _they ne geten hem_: 'nec portionem, quae nulla est, nec ipsam, quam
minimè affectat, assequitur.'

77. _that power forleteth_: 'ei, quem ualentia deserit, quem molestia
pungit, quem uilitas abicit, quem recondit obscuritas.' Hence _that_ means
'whom,' and refers to the man.

95. _that shal he not finde._ This is turned into the affirmative instead
of the interrogative form: 'sed num in his eam reperiet, quae
demonstrauimus, id quod pollicentur, non posse conferre?'

119. _norie_, pupil; Lat. 'alumne.'

136. _that lyen_: 'quae autem beatitudinem mentiantur.'

142. _in Timeo_; 'uti in Timaeo Platoni.' Here Chaucer keeps the words _in
Timaeo_ without alteration, as if they formed the title of Plato's work.
The passage is: [Greek: all' ô Sôkrates, touto ge dê pantes hosoi kai kata
brachy sôphrosynês metechousin epi pasê hormê kai smikrou kai megalou
pragmatos theon aei pou kalousin] (27 C).

METRE 9. 3. _from sin that age hadde biginninge_, since the world began:
'ab aeuo.'  _thou that dwellest_: cf. Kn. Tale, A 3004.

5. _necesseden_, compelled, as by necessity: 'pepulerunt.'

6. _floteringe matere_: 'materiae fluitantis'; see below, Pr. xi. 156.

8. _beringe_, &c.; see Leg. of Good Women, 2229, and note.

13. _Thou bindest_: 'Tu numeris elementa ligas.'

14. _colde._ Alluding to the old doctrine of the four elements, with their
qualities. Thus the nature of fire was thought to be _hot_ and _dry_, that
of water _cold_ and _moist_, that of air _cold_ and _dry_, that of earth
_hot_ and _moist_. Cf. Ovid, Met. i. 19:--

 'Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,
  Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus.
  Hanc Deus et melior litem Natura diremit ...
  Dissociata locis concordi pace ligauit.'

Sometimes the four elements are represented as lying in four layers; the
earth at the bottom, and above it the water, the air, and the fire, in due
order. This arrangement is here alluded to. Cf. Kn. Ta. A 2992.

18. _Thou knittest_, &c.

 'Tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta mouentem
  Connectens animam per consona membra resoluis.
  Quae cum secta duos motum glomerauit in orbes,
  In semet reditura meat mentemque profundam
  Circuit, et simili conuertit imagine caelum.
  Tu caussis animas paribus uitasque minores
  Prouehis, et leuibus sublimes curribus aptans
  In caelum terramque seris, quas lege benigna
  Ad te conuersas reduci facis igne reuerti.
  Da pater angustam menti conscendere sedem,
  Da fontem lustrare boni, da luce reperta
  In te conspicuos animi defigere uisus.'

24. _cartes_, vehicles; the bodies which contain the souls.

34. _berer_: 'uector, dux, semita, terminus idem.'

PROSE 10. 8. _for that veyn_, in order that vain, &c.

11. _ne is_, exists. We should now drop the negative after 'deny.' _nis
right as_, is precisely as.

12. _is proeved_: 'id imminutione perfecti imperfectum esse perhibetur.'

14. _in every thing general_: 'in quolibet genere.'

21. _descendeth_: 'in haec extrema atque effeta dilabitur.' Cf. Kn. Ta.
3003-10.

31, 2. _that nothing nis bettre_, i.e. than whom nothing is better. So
below (l. 70) we have--'that nothing nis more worth.'

32. _nis good_, is good. The _ne_ is due to the preceding 'douted.'

39. _for as moche_: 'ne in infinitum ratio procedat.'

51. _this prince_; Caxton and Thynne have _the fader_; Lat. 'patrem.'

62. _feigne_: 'fingat qui potest.'

88. _thanne ne may_: 'quare neutrum poterit esse perfectum, cum alterutri
alterum deest.' Thus we must read _may_ (sing.), not _mowen_ (pl.).

98. _Upon thise thinges_, besides this: 'Super haec.'

100. _porismes_: '[Greek: porismata]'; corollaries, or deductions from a
foregoing demonstration.

101. _as a corollarie_: 'ueluti corollarium.' _Corollary_ is derived from
_corolla_, dimin. of _corona_, a garland. It meant money paid for a garland
of flowers; hence, a gift, present, gratuity; and finally, an additional
inference from a proposition. Chaucer gives the explanation _mede of
coroune_, i.e. gift of a garland.

106. _they ben maked iust_: these four words must be added to make sense;
it is plain that they were lost by the inadvertence of the scribes. Lat.
text: 'Sed uti iustitiae adeptione _iusti_, sapientiae sapientes fiunt, ita
diuinitatem adeptos, Deos fieri simili ratione necesse est.'

165. _the soverein fyn_; Lat. text: 'ut summa, cardo, atque caussa.'
Chaucer seems to have taken _summa_ to be the superl. adjective; and _fyn_,
i.e. end, is meant to represent _cardo_.

METRE 10. 8. _Tagus_; the well-known river flowing by Toledo and Lisbon,
once celebrated for its golden sands; see Ovid, Am. i. 15. 34; Met. ii.
251, &c.

10. _Hermus_, an auriferous river of Lydia, into which flowed the still
more celebrated Pactolus. 'Auro turbidus Hermus;' Verg. Georg. ii. 137.

_rede brinke_: 'rutilante ripa.'

_Indus_; now the Sind, in N. W. India.

11. _that medleth_: 'candidis miscens uirides lapillos'; which Chaucer
explains as mingling _smaragdes_ (emeralds) with _margaretes_ (pearls); see
footnote on p. 80.

17. _that eschueth_: 'Vitat obscuras animae ruinas.'

PROSE 11. 3. _How mochel_; i.e. at what price will you appraise it: 'quanti
aestimabis.'

24. _The thinges thanne_: 'Quae igitur, cùm discrepant, minimè bona sunt;
cùm uero unum esse coeperint, bona fiunt: nonne haec ut bona sint, unitatis
fieri adeptione contingit?'

55. _non other_; i.e. no other conclusion: 'minimè aliud uidetur.'

63. _travaileth him_, endeavours: 'tueri salutem laborat.'

71. _thar thee nat doute_, thou needst not doubt.

81. _What woltow_: 'Quid, quod omnes, uelut in terras ore demerso trahunt
alimenta radicibus, ac per medullas robur corticemque diffundunt?'
(_maryes_, marrows.)

91. _renovelen and puplisshen hem_: 'propagentur.'

92. _that they ne ben_, that they are; the superfluous _ne_ is due to the
_ne_ preceding.

110. _But fyr_: 'Ignis uero omnem refugit sectionem.'

112. _wilful_: 'de uoluntariis animae cognoscentis motibus.'

123. _som-tyme_: 'gignendi opus ... interdum coërcet uoluntas.'

128. _And thus_: 'Adeò haec sui caritas.'

142. _for yif that that oon_: 'hoc enim sublato, nec esse quidem cuiquam
permanebit.'

156. _floteren_, fluctuate, waver; 'fluitabunt'; see above, Met. ix. 6.

161. _for thou hast_: 'ipsam enim mediae ueritatis notam mente fixisti.'

163. _in that_, in that thing which: 'in hoc ... quod.'

METRE 11. 2. _mis-weyes_, by-paths: 'nullis ... deuiis.'

_rollen and trenden_: 'reuoluat.' Chaucer here uses the causal verb
_trenden_, to revolve, answering to an A.S. form _*trendan_, causal of a
lost verb _*trindan_. The E. _trund-le_ is from the same strong verb (pp.
_*getrunden_).

 'Longosque in orbem cogat inflectens motus,
  Animumque doceat quidquid extra molitur
  Suis retrusum possidere thesauris.'

7. Cf. Troilus, iv. 200.

8. _lighten_, i.e. shine: 'Lucebit.'

10. _Glosa._ This gloss is an alternative paraphrase of all that precedes,
from the beginning of the Metre.

32. _Plato_. From Plato's Phaedo, where Socrates says: [Greek: hoti hêmin
hê mathêsis ouk allo ti ê anamnêsis tynchanei ousa] (72 E).

PROSE 12. 18. _Wendest_, didst ween: 'Mundum, inquit, hunc â Deo regi
paullo antè minimè dubitandum putabas.' Surely Chaucer has quite mistaken
the construction. He should rather have said: 'Thou wendest, quod she, a
litel her-biforn that men ne sholden nat doute,' &c.

19. _nis governed_, is governed; the same construction as before. So also
_but-yif there nere_ = unless there were (l. 25).

28. _yif ther ne were_: 'nisi unus esset, qui quod nexuit contineret.'

30. _bringe forth_, bring about, dispose, arrange: 'disponeret.'

_so ordenee_: 'tam dispositos motus.'

38. _that thou_: 'ut felicitatis compos, patriam sospes reuisas.'

55. _a keye and a stere_: 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum.' Here
Chaucer unluckily translates _clauus_ as if it were _clauis_.

63. _ne sheweth_: 'non minùs ad contuendum patet'; i.e. is equally plain to
be seen.

67. _by the keye_: 'bonitatis clauo'; see note to l. 55.

73. _It mot nedes be so_: 'Ita, inquam, necesse est; nec beatum regimen
esse uideretur, si quidem detrectantium iugum foret, non obtemperantium
salus.' The translation has here gone wrong.

87. _softely_, gently, pleasurably: 'suauiter.'

91. _so at the laste_: 'ut tandem aliquando stultitiam magna _lacerantem_
sui pudeat.' Another common reading is _latrantem_, but this was evidently
not the reading in Chaucer's copy; MS. C. has _lacerantem_.

97. _the poetes._ See Ovid, Met. i. 151-162; Vergil, Georg. i. 277-283.

116. _Scornest thou me_: 'Ludisne, inquam, me, inextricabilem labyrinthum
rationibus texens, quae nunc quidem, qua egrediaris, introeas; nunc uerò
qua introieris, egrediare; an mirabilem quemdam diuinae simplicitatis orbem
complicas?'

117. _the hous of Dedalus_; used to translate 'labyrinthum.' See Vergil,
Aen. vi. 24-30, v. 588. No doubt Boethius borrowed the word
_inextricabilis_ from Aen. vi. 27.

125. _for which_: 'ex quo neminem beatum fore, nisi qui pariter Deus esset,
quasi munusculum dabas.' Here _munusculum_ refers to _corollarium_, which
Chaucer translates by 'a mede of coroune'; see above, Pr. x. 101.

132. _by the governements_: 'bonitatis gubernaculis.'

135. _by proeves in cercles and hoomlich knowen_: 'atque haec nullis
extrinsecus sumptis, sed altero ex altero fidem trahente insitis
domesticisque probationibus.' Chaucer inserts _in cercles and_, by way of
reference to arguments drawn from circles; but the chief argument of this
character really occurs later, viz. in Bk. iv. Pr. vi. 81.

143. _Parmenides_, a Greek philosopher who, according to Plato, accompanied
Zeno to Athens, where he became acquainted with Socrates, who was then but
a young man. Plato, in his Sophistes, quotes the line of Parmenides which
is here referred to: [Greek: pantothen eukyklou sphairas enalinkion onkô].
This the MSS. explain to mean: 'rerum orbem mobilem rotat, dum se immobilem
ipsa conseruat.' The Greek quotation is corruptly given in the MSS., but is
restored by consulting Plato's text (244 E); hence we do not know what
reading Boethius adopted. It can hardly have been the one here given, which
signifies that God is 'like the mass of a sphere that is well-rounded on
all sides.' Perhaps he took the idea of God's immobility from the next two
verses:--

  [Greek: messothen isopales pantê, to gar oute ti meizon]
  [Greek: oute bebaioteron pelei.]

i.e. 'equidistant from the centre in all directions; for there is nothing
greater (than Him), and nothing more immoveable.'

152. _Plato._ From Plato's Timaeus, 29 B: [Greek: hôs ara tous logous
hônper eisin exêgêtai, toutôn autôn kai syngeneis ontas]. Chaucer quotes
this saying twice; see Cant. Tales, A 741-2, H 207-210.

METRE 12. 3. _Orpheus._ This well-known story is well told in Vergil,
Georg. iv. 454-527; and in Ovid, Met. x. 1-85.

_Trace_, Thrace; as in Cant. Ta. A 1972.

4. _weeply_, tearful, sorrowful: 'flebilibus.'

5. _moevable_ should precede _riveres_; 'Silvas currere, mobiles Amnes
stare coegerat.' Chaucer took these two lines separately.

12. _hevene goddes_, gods of heaven: 'superos.'

 'Illic blanda sonantibus Chordis carmina temperans
  Quicquid praecipuis deae Matris fontibus hauserat,
  Quod luctus dabat impotens, Quod luctum geminans amor
  Deflet Taenara commouens, Et dulci ueniam prece
  Umbrarum dominos rogat.'

16. _laved out_, drawn up (as from a well). The M. E. _laven_, to draw up
water, to pour out, is from the A. S. _lafian_, to pour; for which see
Cockayne's A. S. Leechdoms, ii. 124, ii. 74, iii. 48. It is further
illustrated in my Etym. Dict., s. v. _Lavish_, its derivative. No doubt it
was frequently confused with F. _laver_, to wash; but it is an independent
Teutonic word, allied to G. _laben_. In E. Friesic we find _lafen sük_ or
_laven sük_, to refresh oneself. It is curious that it appears even in so
late an author as Dryden, who translates Lat. _egerit_ (Ovid, Met. xi. 488)
by _laves_, i.e. bales out. And see _laven_ in Mätzner.

16. _Calliope._ Orpheus was son of Oeagrus, king of Thrace, and of
Calliope, chief of the Muses; cf. Ovid, Ibis, 484.

17. _and he song._ This does not very well translate the Latin text; see
note to l. 12.

21. _of relesinge_: 'ueniam'; i.e. for the release (of Eurydice).

22. _Cerberus_, the three-headed dog; cf. Verg. Georg. iv. 483; Aen. vi.
417; Ovid, Met. iv. 449.

23. _Furies_; the Eumenides; cf. Verg. Georg. iv. 483; Ovid, Met. x. 46.

26. _Ixion_, who was fastened to an ever-revolving wheel; see Georg. iv.
484; iii. 38; Ovid, Met. iv. 460.

_overthrowinge_, turning over: 'Non Ixionium caput Velox praecipitat rota.'

27. _Tantalus_, tormented by perpetual thirst; Ovid, Met. x. 41; iv. 457.

29. _Tityus_: 'Vultur dum satur est modis Non traxit Tityi iecur.' Cf.
Verg. Aen. vi. 595-600; Ovid, Met. iv. 456. And see Troilus, i. 786-8.

34. _But we wol_: 'Sed lex dona coërceat.'

37. _But what_; quoted in Kn. Tale, A 1164.

42. _and was deed_: 'occidit.' The common story does not involve the
immediate death of Orpheus.

49. _loketh_, beholds: 'uidet inferos.' The story of Orpheus is excellently
told in King Alfred's translation of Boethius, cap. xxxv. §6.


BOOK IV.

PROSE 1. 5. _forbrak_, broke off, interrupted: 'abrupi.'

14. _so as_, seeing that, since: 'cùm.'

25. _alle thinges may_, is omnipotent: 'potentis omnia.'

27. _an enbasshinge ... ende_: 'infiniti stuporis.'

30. _right ordenee_, well ordered: 'dispositissima domo.'

32. _heried_, praised. This resembles the language of St. Paul; 2 Tim. ii.
20.

41. _cesen_, cause to cease: 'sopitis querelis.'

45. _alle thinges_, all things being treated of: 'decursis omnibus.'

47. _fetheres_, wings; 'pennas.' The A. S. pl. _fethera_ sometimes means
wings.

50. _sledes_, sleds, i. e. sledges: 'uehiculis.' The Vulgate version of 1
Chron. xx. 3 has: 'et fecit super eos tribulas, et _trahas_, et ferrata
carpenta transire.' Wycliffe translates _trahas_ by _sledis_ (later
version, _sleddis_).

METRE 1. 2-5. Quoted in Ho. Fame, 973-8.

5. _fyr_, fire. In the old astronomy, the region of air was supposed to be
surrounded by a region of fire, which Boethius here says was caused by the
swift motion of the ether: 'Quique agili motu calet aetheris Transcendit
ignis uerticem.' Beyond this region were the planetary spheres, viz. those
of the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This
explains the allusion to the passage of Thought (Imagination) through 'the
houses that bear the stars' (i. e. planets), in Latin _astriferas domos_,
and so, past the sun, to the seventh sphere of Saturn. After this, Thought
soars to the eighth sphere, called the Sphere of the Fixed Stars (denoted
below by 'the circle of the stars' or 'the firmament'); and after 'wending
on the back of it,' i. e. getting beyond it, reaches the _primum mobile_,
where 'the lord of kings holds the sceptre of his might.'

 'Donec in astriferas surgat domos,
    Phoeboque coniungat uias,
  Aut comitetur iter gelidi senis
    Miles corusci sideris;
  Vel quocunque micans nox pingitur,
    Recurrat astri circulum,
  Atque ubi iam exhausti fuerit satis,
    Polum relinquit extimum,
  Dorsaque uelocis premat aetheris
    Compos uerendi luminis.'

9. _Saturnus_, the planet Saturn; which Chaucer rightly gives as the sense
of 'senis.'

_and he y-maked_, i.e. and he (Thought) becomes a knight. I hesitate to
insert _is_ after _he_, because all the authorities omit it; in fact, the
phrase _and he y-maked_ seems to be equivalent to 'he being made.' I do not
understand what is meant by 'Miles corusci sideris,' unless it means that
Boethius imagines Thought to become a companion of Mars, and thus to be
made a soldier, in the service of that bright planet.

15. _images of sterres_, i.e. constellations, which were fancifully
supposed to represent various objects.

18. _worshipful light._ MS. A has _dredefulle clerenesse_. Both are
translations of 'uerendi luminis.'

22. _swifte cart_: 'uolucrem currum.' _Cart_ is sometimes used for car or
chariot.

25. _but now_, &c. These words are supposed to be spoken by Boethius, when
he remembers all the truth. 'Haec dices, memini, patria est mihi.'

26. _heer wol I fastne my degree_: 'hic sistam gradum.' The sense is
rather, 'here will I [_or_, let me] fix my step,' or 'plant my foot'; i.e.
remain. Cf. 'Siste gradum,' i. e. stop; Verg. Aen. vi. 465.

27. _But yif_:

 'Quod si terrarum placeat tibi
    Noctem relictam uisere,
  Quos miseri toruos populi timent
    Cernes tyrannos exules.'

PROSE 2. 1. _owh_, an exclamation; 'Papae.'

13. _fey_, the faith, the certainty: 'fides.' _sentence_, opinion.

31. _And in that_: 'Quod uero quisque potest.' _may_, can do.

38. _lad_, led; _studies_, desires: 'quae diuersis studiis agitur.'

71. _Yif that_: 'Etsi coniecto, inquam, quid uelis.'

84. _knit forth_: 'Contexe, inquam, cetera.'

93. _shewinge_, evident; _is open and shewinge_: 'patet.'

97. _Iugement._ Evidently meant to translate _iudicium_. But Chaucer
misread his text, which has _indicium_. 'Idque, ut medici sperare solent,
indicium est erectae iam resistentisque naturae.'

103. _ledeth hem_, i. e. leads them to: 'qui ne ad hoc quidem peruenire
queunt, ad quod eos naturalis ducit, ac pene compellit, intentio.'

104. _And what_: 'Et quid? si hoc tam magno ac pene inuicto praeeuntis
naturae desererentur auxilio?'

112. _Ne shrewes_: 'Neque enim leuia aut ludicra praemia petunt, quae
consequi atque obtinere non possunt.'

120. _laye_, might lie (subjunctive): 'quo nihil ulterius peruium iaceret
incessui.'

137. _for to ben_, even to exist. So below, _ben_ frequently means 'to
exist,' as appears from the argument.

151. _mowen_, have power to act: 'possunt.'

161. _understonde_, mayest understand: 'ut intelligas.'

187. _Plato_, viz. in the Gorgias and Alcibiades I, where many of the
arguments here used may be found.

METRE 2. The subject of this metre is from Plato, De Republica, x.
Chaucer's translation begins with the 7th line of the Latin.

 'Quos uides sedere celsos Solii culmine reges,
  Purpura claros nitente, Septos tristibus armis,
  Ore toruo comminantes, Rabie cordis anhelos,
  Detrahat si quis superbis Vani tegmina cultus,
  Iam uidebit intus arctas Dominos ferre catenas.
  Hinc enim libido uersat Auidis corda uenenis;
  Hinc flagellat ira mentem Fluctus turbida tollens,
  Moeror aut captos fatigat, Aut spes lubrica torquet.
  Ergo, cum caput tot unum Cernas ferre tyrannos,
  Non facit, quod optat, ipse Dominis pressus iniquis.'

12. _tyrannyes._ This reading (in C ed.) gives the sense better than the
reading _tyrauntis_ (in A); although the latter is quite literal.

PROSE 3. 7. _stadie_, race-course: 'in stadio'; which Chaucer explains by
'furlong.'

10. _purposed_, equivalent to _proposed_; 'praemium commune propositum.'

14. _For which thing_: 'quare probos mores sua praemia non relinquunt.'

25, 26. _so as_, whereas. _for men_, because men.

27. _part-les_, without his share of: 'praemii ... expertem.'

35. _no day_: 'quod nullus deterat dies.'

39. _undepartable_, inseparable: 'inseparabili poena.'

49. _may it semen_: 'possuntne sibi supplicii expertes uideri, quos omnium
malorum extrema nequitia non afficit modò, verumetiam uehementer inficit?'

70. _under_, beneath, below: 'infra hominis meritum.'

METRE 3. 1. _aryvede_, cause to arrive, drove: 'appulit.'

_the sailes_: 'Vela Neritii ducis;' Chaucer inserts _Ulixes_, i. e.
Ulysses. The phrase is from Ovid: 'Dux quoque Neritius,' i. e. Ulysses;
Fasti, iv. 69. Neritos was a mountain of Ithaca, the island of Ulysses. MS.
C. reads _Naricii_, which accounts for the form _Narice_.

3. _Circes_, Circe, as in Ho. Fame, 1272; inserted by Chaucer.

7. _that oon of hem_: 'Hunc apri facies tegit.'--'One of them, his face is
covered,' &c.

9. _Marmorike_: 'Marmaricus leo.' This refers to the country of Barca, on
the N. African coast, to the W. of Egypt.

13. _But al-be-it_: 'Sed licet uariis modis Numen Arcadis alitis Obsitum
miserans ducens Peste soluerit hospitis.' _Arcas ales_, the winged
Arcadian, i. e. Mercury, because born on the Arcadian mountain Cyllene.

16. _algates_, at any rate; _by this_, already.

19. _akornes of okes_; this is not tautology, for an _acorn_ was,
originally, any fruit of the field, as the etymology (from _acre_) shews.

23. _over-light_, too light, too feeble: 'O leuem nimium manum, Nec
potentia gramina, Membra quae ualeant licet, Corda uertere non ualent.'

32. _for vyces_: 'Dira, quae penitus meant, Nec nocentia corpori Mentis
uulnere saeuiunt.'

PROSE 4. 2. _ne I ne see nat_: 'nec iniuria dici uideo uitiosos, tametsi
humani corporis speciem seruent, in belluas tamen animorum qualitate
mutari.' Chaucer's 'as by right' should rather be 'as by wrong.' It means
'I do not see that it is wrongly said.'

4, 5. _But I nolde_, but I would rather that it were not so with regard to
evil men: 'eis licere noluissem.'

18. _to mowen don_, to be able to do: 'potuisse.'

22. _three_, i. e. the triple misfortune of _wishing_ to do evil, of _being
able_ to do it, and of _doing_ it.

26. _thilke unselinesse_: 'hoc infortunio'; i. e. the ability to sin.

28. _So shullen_: 'Carebunt, inquit, ocius, quàm uel tu forsitan uelis, uel
illi sese existiment esse carituros.'

30. _For ther_: 'Neque enim est aliquid in tam breuibus uitae metis ita
serum, quod exspectare longum immortalis praesertim animus putet.'

39. _by the outtereste_: 'eorum malitiam ... mors extrema finiret.'

42. _ben perdurable_, i. e. to exist eternally: 'infinitam liquet esse
miseriam, quam constat esse aeternam.'

51. _ther is not why_, there is no reason why.

54. _but of the thinges_: 'sed ex his, quae sumpta sunt, aeque est
necessarium.'

64. _but I understande_: 'sed alio quodam modo infeliciores esse improbos
arbitror impunitos, tametsi nulla ratio correctionis, nullus respectus
habeatur exempli.' Thus 'non ensaumple of lokinge' is wrong; it should
rather be 'non lokinge of ensaumple,' i. e. no regard to the example thus
set.

90. _which defaute_: 'quam iniquitatis merito malum esse confessus es.'
Hence 'for the deserte of felonye' means 'when we consider what wickedness
deserves.'

102. _to leten_, to leave: 'nullane animarum supplicia ... relinquis?'

132. _briddes_, i. e. owls. See Parl. Foules, 599.

142. _right as thou_: 'ueluti si uicibus sordidam humum caelumque
respicias, cunctis extra cessantibus, ipsa cernendi ratione nunc coeno nunc
sideribus interesse uidearis.'

153. Wrong. It should rather run: 'sholde we wene that _we_ were blinde?'
Lat. 'num uidentes eadem caecos putaremus?'

193. _in al_, altogether: 'tota,' sc. opera defensorum.

197, 8. _at any clifte_: 'aliqua rimula.'

_sawen_, if they should perceive: 'uiderent.'

200. _right for_: 'compensatione adipiscendae probitatis.' Hence _for to
geten hem_ means 'of obtaining for themselves.'

205. _y-leten_, left: 'nullus prorsus odio locus relinquatur.'

METRE 4. 1. _What delyteth you_, Why does it delight you? 'Quid tantos
iuuat excitare motus?'

Lines 8-10 are put interrogatively in the Latin text.

9. _and wilnen_: 'Alternisque uolunt perire telis.'

10. _But the resoun_: 'Non est iusta satis saeuitiae ratio.'

PROSE 5. 9. _y-shad_, shed, spread abroad: 'transfunditur.'

20. _hepeth_: 'Nunc stuporem meum Deus rector exaggerat.'

METRE 5. The Latin text begins thus:--

 'Si quis Arcturi sidera nescit
  Propinqua summo cardine labi,
  Cur legat tardus plaustra Boötes,
  Mergatque seras aequore flammas,
  Cum nimis celeres explicet ortus,
  Legem stupebit aetheris alti.'

1. _sterres of Arcture_, the stars of the constellation Arcturus. Arcturus
was (as here) another name for Boötes, though it properly meant the
brightest star in that constellation. It is at no great distance from the
north pole, and so appears to revolve round it. The passage, which is
somewhat obscure, seems to refer to the manner of the rising and setting of
Boötes; and the argument is, that a person ignorant of astronomy, must be
puzzled to understand the laws that rule the motions of the sky.

3. _the sterre_, the constellation. Chaucer uses _sterre_ in this sense in
several passages; see Kn. Tale, A 2059, 2061, and the notes.

8. _the fulle mone._ This alludes to an eclipse of the moon, as appears
from below.

9. _infect_: 'Infecta metis noctis opacae.'

_confuse_, confounded, overcome; the light of the moon disappears in a full
eclipse, rendering the stars brighter.

11. _The comune errour_: 'Commouet gentes publicus error.' The people who
do not understand an eclipse, are excited by it; they bring out basins, and
beat them with a loud din, to frighten away the spirit that is preying on
the moon. Chaucer calls them _Corybantes_, but these were the priests of
Cybele. Still, they celebrated her rites to the sound of noisy music; and
he may have been thinking of a passage in Ovid, Fasti, iv. 207-14. C. adds
a gloss: 'i. vulgaris error, quo putatur luna incantari.'

12. _thikke strokes_, frequent strokes. The word resembles _thilke_ in C.,
because _lk_ is not unfrequently written for _kk_ in the fifteenth century,
to the confusion of some editors; see my paper on Ghost-words, in the
Philol. Soc. Trans. 1886, p. 370.

18. _by quakinge flodes_: 'frementi ... fluctu.'

23. _alle thinges_: 'Cuncta, quae rara prouehit aetas.'

24. _troubly errour_: 'nubilus error.'

PROSE 6. 9. _laven it_, to exhaust the subject: 'cui uix exhausti quidquam
satis sit.' As to _lave_, see note to Bk. iii. Met. 12-16.

13. _Ydre_, Hydra; see note below to Met. 7. The form is due to _hydrae_
(MS. _hydre_) in the Latin text.

_Ne ther ... ende_: 'nec ullus fuerit modus.' _Manere_ is not the sense of
_modus_ here; it rather means _ende_ or 'limit.'

14. _but-yif_: 'nisi quis eas uiuacissimo mentis igne coërceat.'

24, 5. _But althogh_: 'Quòd si te musici carminis oblectamenta delectant,
hanc oportet paullisper differas uoluptatem, dum nexas sibi ordine contexo
rationes.' This is said, because this 'Prose' is of unusual length. For
_sibi_, another reading is _tibi_; hence Chaucer's 'weve _to thee_
resouns.'

30. _muable_, mutable, changeable: 'mutabilium naturarum.' Cf. Kn. Tale, A
2994-3015.

33. _in the tour_: 'Haec in suae simplicitatis arce composita, multiplicem
rebus gerendis modum statuit.'

48. _but destinee_: 'fatum uero singula digerit in motum, locis, formis, ac
temporibus distributa.'

59. _and ledeth_: 'et quod simpliciter praesentarieque prospexit, per
temporales ordines ducit.' Cf. Troilus, i. 1065-9.

67. _by some sowle_; glossed 'anima mundi.' This idea is from Plato, De
Legibus, bk. x: [Greek: psychên dê dioikousan kai enoikousan en hapasi tois
pantê kinoumenois môn ou kai ton ouranon anankê dioikein phanai]; (896 D).

68. _by the celestial_, &c.; alluding to the old astrology.

81. _a same centre_; i.e. concentric circles, as on a target.

87. _and yif ther be_: 'si quid uero illi se medio connectat et societ, in
simplicitatem cogitur, diffundique ac diffluere cessat.'

93. _laus_, loose; from Icel. _lauss_. Also spelt _loos_, _los_. _it
axeth_: 'quantò illum rerum cardinem uicinius petit.' Thus _it axeth_ is
due to 'petit,' i.e. seeks, tends to.

97. _Thanne right swich_: 'Igitur uti est ad intellectum ratiocinatio; ad
id quod est, id quod gignitur; ad aeternitatem tempus; ad puncti medium
circulus: ita est fati series mobilis ad prouidentiae stabilem
simplicitatem.'

108. _whan they passen_: 'cùm ... proficiscantur.' Thus _whan_ should
rather be _so as_, i.e. whereas, because.

112. _unable to ben ybowed_: 'indeclinabilem caussarum ordinem promat.'

114. _sholden fleten_: 'res ... temerè fluituras.'

_For which it is_: 'Quo fit.'

116. _natheles_: 'nihilominus tamen suus modus ad bonum dirigens cuncta
disponat.'

121. _ne the ordre_: 'ne dum ordo de summi boni cardine proficiscens, a suo
quoquam deflectat exordio.' MS. C. has 'deflectatur.'

123. 'Quae uero, inquies, potest ulla iniquior esse confusio.' For
'iniquior,' MS. C. has the extraordinary reading 'inquiescior,' which
Chaucer seems to have tried to translate.

138. _Ne it ne is nat_: 'Non enim dissimile est miraculum nescienti.'

145. _hele of corages_: 'animorum salus.'

148. _lecher_, i.e. leech-er, healer: 'medicator mentium Deus.'

151. _leneth hem_, gives them: 'quod conuenire nouit, accommodat.' Printed
_leueth_ in Dr. Furnivall's print of MS. C., but _leneth_ in Morris's
edition of MS. A. There is no doubt as to the right reading, because
_accommodare_ and _lenen_ are both used in the sense 'to lend.'

154. _for to constreine_: 'ut pauca ... perstringam,' i.e. 'to touch
lightly on a few things.' Chaucer has taken it too literally, but his
paraphrase is nearly right.

157. _right kepinge_: 'aequi seruantissimum.'

159. _my familer_: 'familiaris noster Lucanus.' Alluding to the famous
line:--'Victrix caussa deis placuit, sed uicta Catoni'; Pharsalia, i. 128.

168. _with-holden_, retain: 'retinere fortunam.'

176. _by me_, by my means, by my help: 'Nam ut quidam me quoque
excellentior ait.' This looks like a slip on the part of Boethius himself,
for the supposed speaker is Philosophy herself. The philosopher here
alluded to still remains unknown. MS. C. has 'me quidem'; and 'me' is
glossed by 'philosophus per me.'

177. _in Grek._ Some MSS. have: [Greek: andros hierou sôma dynameis
oikodomousi]. There are various readings, but Chaucer had before him only
the interpretation: 'Viri sacri corpus aedificauerunt uirtutes.' Such is
the reading in MS. C.

179. _taken_, delivered, entrusted. 'Fit autem saepe, uti bonis summa rerum
gerenda deferatur.'

182. _remordeth_: 'remordet,' i.e. plagues, troubles.

186. _And other folk_: 'Alii plus aequo metuunt, quod ferre possunt.'

201. _of wikkede merite_: 'eos male meritos omnes existimant.'

206. _serven to shrewes_: 'famulari saepe improbis.' _I trowe_: 'illud
etiam dispensari credo.'

207, 8. _overthrowinge to yvel_: 'praeceps.'

209. _egren him_: 'eum ... exacerbare possit.'

219. _shal be cause_: 'ut exercitii bonis, et malis esset caussa
supplicii.' Hence _continuacion_ seems to mean 'endurance' or
'continuance.'

242. _sin that_: the original is in Greek, with (in MS. C.) the false
gloss:--'fortissimus in mundo Deus omnia regit.' The Greek is--[Greek:
Argaleon de me tauta theon hôs pant' agoreuein]. From Homer, Il. xii. 176,
with the change from [Greek: agoreusai] to [Greek: agoreuein].

247. _with-holden_, to retain, keep, maintain; 'retinere.'

253. _ben outrageous or haboundant_: 'abundare.' Hence _outrageous_ is
'superfluous' or 'excessive.'

257. _and whan_: 'quo refectus, firmior in ulteriora contendas.'

METRE 6. 1. 'Si uis celsi iura tonantis Pura sollers cernere mente, Adspice
summi culmina caeli'; &c.

5. _cercle_: 'Non Sol ... Gelidum Phoebes impedit axem.'

6. _Ne the sterre_: 'Nec quae summo uertice mundi Flectit rapidos Ursa
meatus, Numquam occiduo lota profundo, Cetera cernens sidera mergi, Cupit
Oceano tingere flammas.' Hence _deyen_ is to dye, to dip.

10. _Hesperus_, the evening-star; _Lucifer_, the morning-star.

13. _And thus_: 'Sic aeternos reficit cursus Alternus amor; sic astrigeris
Bellum discors exsulat oris. Haec concordia temperat aequis Elementa modis,
ut pugnantia Vicibus cedant humida siccis'; &c.

20, 1. _in the firste somer-sesoun warminge_: 'uere tepenti.' This is not
the only place where _uer_ is translated _somer-sesoun_, a phrase used as
applicable to May in P. Plowman, Prol. 1. Another name for 'spring' was
_Lent_ or _Lenten_.

24. _and thilke_: 'Eadem rapiens condit et aufert Obitu mergens orta
supremo.'

29. _And tho_: 'Et quae motu concitat ire, Sistit retrahens, ac uaga
firmat.'

31. _For yif_: 'Nam nisi rectos reuocans itus, Flexos iterum cogat in
orbes, Quae nunc stabilis continet ordo, Dissepta suo fonte fatiscant.'

37. _This is_: 'Hic est cunctis communis amor Repetuntque boni fine teneri,
Quia non aliter durare queunt, Nisi conuerso rursus amore Refluant caussae,
quae dedit esse.'

PROSE 7. 57. _ne also it_: 'ita uir sapiens molestè ferre non debet,
quotiens in fortunae certamen adducitur.'

60. _matere_, material, source.

62. _vertu._ Boethius here derives _uirtus_ from _uires_: 'quod suis
_uiribus_ nitens non superetur aduersis.'

64. _Ne certes_: 'Neque enim uos in prouectu positi uirtutis, diffluere
deliciis, et emarcescere uoluptate uenistis; proelium cum omni fortuna
nimis acre conseritis, ne uos aut tristis opprimat, aut iucunda corrumpat:
firmis medium uiribus occupate.'

72. _in your hand_: 'In uestra enim situm est manu.'

METRE 7. 1. _wreker_, avenger; _Attrides_, Atrides, i.e. Agamemnon, son of
Atreus. Chaucer derived the spelling _Agamenon_ from a gloss in MS. C.
Gower (C. A. ii. 344) has the same form.

2. _recovered_: 'Fratris amissos thalamos piauit.'

5. _Menelaus_, &c.; 'that was his brother Menelaus' wife.' The usual idiom;
see note to Squieres Tale, E 209.

9. _doughter_, i.e. Iphigenia; Ovid, Met. xii. 27-38.

13. _Itacus_: 'Fleuit amissos Ithacus sodales.' The well-known story of
Ulysses of Ithaca; from Homer, Od. ix.

15. _empty_; as if translating 'inani.' But the right reading is _inmani_
(or _immani_); i.e. 'vast.' MS. C. 'inmani,' glossed 'magno.'

20. _Hercules._ See Monkes Tale, B 3285, and the notes. In the first note,
this passage from Boethius is given at length.

21. _Centaures_, Centaurs; Hercules was present at the fight between the
Centauri and Lapithae; Ovid, Met. xii. 541; ix. 191.

22. _lyoun_, the Nemean lion; Ovid, Met. ix. 197, 235; Her. ix. 61.

23. _Arpyes_, the Harpies; with reference to the destruction of the
Stymphalian birds, who ate human flesh; Met. ix. 187. The gloss in the
footnote--_in the palude of lyrne_ (in the marsh of Lerna) is a mistake; it
should refer to the Hydra mentioned below.

25. _dragoun_, the dragon in the garden of the Hesperides; Met. ix. 190.
The 'golden metal' refers to the golden apples.

26. _Cerberus_; Ovid, Met. ix. 185.

27. _unmeke_, proud; see note to Monkes Tale, B 3293; and Ovid, Met. ix.
194-6. Note that _hors_ (= horses) is plural.

29. _Ydra_, Hydra; Ovid, Met. ix. 192.

30. _Achelous_; see the story in Ovid, Met. ix. 1-97. Boethius imitates
Ovid, l. 97, viz. 'Et lacerum cornu mediis caput abdidit undis.'

35. _Antheus_, Antaeus; Ovid, Met. ix. 184. For the story, see Lucan,
Phars. iv. 590-660; Lucan refers to _Lybia_ as the place of combat; l. 582.

36. _Cacus_; see the story in Ovid, Fasti, i. 543-86.

39. _boor_, the boar of Erymanthus; Ovid, Her. ix. 87. For _scomes_ (lit.
scums), Caxton and Thynne have _vomes_, for _fomes_ (foams).

40. _the whiche_, 'which shoulders were fated to sustain (lit. thrust
against) the high sphere of heaven.' Alluding to Hercules, when he took the
place of Atlas.

45. _nake_, expose your unarmed backs (Lat. nudatis), like one who runs
away. An unarmed man was usually said to be _naked_; as in Othello, v. 2.
258; 2 Hen. VI. iii. 2. 234; &c.


BOOK V.

PROSE 1. 3. A mistranslation. 'Recta quidem exhortatio, tuaque prorsus
auctoritate dignissima.'

9. _assoilen to thee the._ I prefer this reading, adopted from Caxton's
edition, because the others make no sense. The original reading was _to the
the_ (= _to thee the_), as in MS. Ii. 1. 38, whence, by dropping one _the_,
the reading _to the_ in C. and Ed. MS. A. alters it to _the to the_,
absurdly. The fact is, that _to thee_ belongs to the next clause. 'Festino,
inquit, debitum promissionis absoluere, uiamque _tibi_,' &c.

14. _to douten_, to be feared; 'uerendumque est.'

28. _left, or dwellinge_, left, or remaining (_reliquus_). 'Quis enim ...
locus esse ullus temeritati reliquus potest?'

31. _nothing_: 'nihil ex nihilo exsistere.' Referring to the old
saying:--'Ex nihilo nihil fit.'

34. _prince and beginnere_ oddly represents Lat. 'principio.' _casten it_,
laid it down: 'quasi quoddam iecerint fundamentum.' I supply _it_.

44. _Aristotulis_, Aristotle. The reference is to Aristotle's Physics, bk.
ii. ch. 5.

47. _for grace_, for the sake of; 'gratia.'

50. _Right as_, just as if. _by cause_, for the purpose.

55. _ne dolve_, had not digged; subj. mood.

57. _abregginge._ A mistranslation. 'Hae sunt igitur fortuiti caussae
compendii'; these then are the causes of this fortuitous acquisition.
_Compendium_ also means 'an abbreviating,' which Chaucer here expresses by
_abbregginge_, introducing at the same time the word 'hap,' to make some
sense.

66. _uneschuable_, inevitable; 'ineuitabili.'

METRE 1. 2. _Achemenie_: 'Rupis Achaemeniae scopulis,' in the crags of the
Achæmenian rock or mountain. _Achaemenius_ signifies 'Persian,' from
Achaemenes, the grandfather of Cyrus; but is here extended to mean
Armenian. The sources of the Tigris and Euphrates are really different,
though both rise in the mountains of Armenia; they run for a long way at no
great distance apart, and at last join.

3. _fleinge bataile_, the flying troop; with reference to the well-known
Parthian habit, of shooting arrows at those who pursue them; see Vergil,
Georg. iii. 31.

5. _yif they_, when they; meaning that they _do_ converge.

9. _and the wateres_: 'Mixtaque fortuitos implicet unda modos: Quae tamen
ipsa uagos terrae decliuia cursus Gurgitis et lapsi defluus ordo regit.'

14. _it suffereth_: 'Fors patitur frenos, ipsaque lege meat.'

PROSE 2. 4, 5. _destinal_, fatal; 'fatalis.' _corages_, minds.

10. _thinges ... fleen_, i.e. to be avoided: 'fugienda.'

13. _is_, i.e. is in, resides in: 'quibus in ipsis inest ratio.'

14. _ordeyne_, determine: 'constituo.'

16. _sovereines_, the supreme divine substances. This is a good example of
adjectives of French origin with a plural in _-es_.

17, 18. _wil_: 'et incorrupta uoluntas.' _might_: 'potestas.'

27. _talents_, affections: 'affectibus.'

30. _caitifs_, captive: 'propriâ libertate captiuae.' Ll. 30-34 are
repeated in Troilus, iv. 963-6; q.v.

34. _in Greek_: [Greek: pant' ephora kai pant' epakouei]. From Homer,
Iliad, iii. 277--[Greek: Êelios th', hos pant' ephoras kai pant'
epakoueis]. Cf. Odys. xii. 323.

METRE 2. 1, 2. _with the_, &c.; 'Melliflui ... oris.' _cleer_, bright;
alluding to the common phrase in Homer: [Greek: lampron phaos êelioio]; Il.
i. 605, &c.

8. _strok_: 'Uno mentis cernit in ictu.'

PROSE 3. A large portion of this Prose, down to l. 71, is paraphrased in
Troilus, iv. 967-1078; q.v.

12. _libertee of arbitre_, freedom of will (arbitrii).

19. _proeve_, approve of: 'Neque ... illam probo rationem.'

30. _but ... ytravailed_: 'Quasi uero ... laboretur'; which means, rather,
'as if the question were.'

35. _But I ne_, &c. The translation is here quite wrong; and as in another
place, Chaucer seems to have read _nitamur_ as _uitamus_. The text has: 'At
nos illud demonstrare nitamur.' The general sense is: 'But let me endeavour
to shew, that, in whatever manner the order of causes be arranged, the
happening of things foreseen is necessary, although the foreknowledge does
not seem to impose on future things a necessity of their happening.'

53. _For althogh that_; cf. Troil. iv. 1051-7, which is clearer.

55. _therfore ne bityde they nat_, it is not on _that_ account that they
happen. Cf. 'Nat that it comth for it purveyed is'; Troil. iv. 1053.

71. _at the laste_, finally: 'Postremò.'

78. _that I ne wot it._ The _ne_ is superfluous, though in all the copies.
The sense is--'if I know a thing, it cannot be false (must be true) that I
know it.'

80. _wanteth lesing_, is free from falsehood: 'mendacio careat.'

90, 1. _egaly_, equally: 'aeque.' _indifferently_, impartially.

94. _Iape-worthy,_ ridiculous: 'ridiculo.' From Horace, Sat. ii. 5. 59--'O
Laërtiade, quicquid dicam, aut erit, aut non.'

116. _sent_, for _sendeth_, sends: 'mittit.'

117. _constreineth_: 'futuri cogit certa necessitas.'

121. _discrecioun_, discernment: 'indiscreta confusio.'

_And yit_, &c. To make sense, read _than whiche_ for _of the whiche_. The
whole clause, from _And yit_ down to _wikke_ is expanded from 'Quoque nihil
sceleratius excogitari potest.'

131. _sin that_: 'quando optanda omnia series indeflexa connectit?'

141. _that nis nat ... or that_, that cannot be approached before. The
Latin is: 'illique inaccessae luci, prius quoque quam impetrent, ipsa
supplicandi ratione coniungi.'

142. _impetren_, ask for it; such is the reading of MS. Ii. 1. 38. A coined
word, from the Lat. _impetrent_; see the last note.

146. _linage of mankind_, the human race; to which _his_ (its) twice refers
below.

147. _a litel her-biforn_; i.e. in Bk. iv. Met. 6. 34, where we find--'they
sholden departen from hir welle, that is to seyn, from hir biginninge, and
faylen.' See p. 122.

METRE 3. 1. _What_, &c.: 'Quaenam discors foedera rerum Caussa resoluit?'

2. _the coniunccioun_; but this gloss seems to be wrong, for the reference
is rather (as Chaucer, following a sidenote in MS. C., says in l. 5) to
foreknowledge and free will.

3. _Whiche god_, i.e. what divinity: 'Quis tanta deus Veris statuit bella
duobus?'

7. _But ther nis._ The Lat. text is put interrogatively: 'An nulla est
discordia ueris, Semperque sibi certa cohaerent?'

10. _by fyr_: 'oppressi luminis igne.'

12. _But wherefore_: 'Sed cur tanto flagrat amore Veri tectas reperire
notas?' It thus appears that _y-covered_, i.e. 'that are hidden,' refers to
_thilke notes_, not to _sooth_; cf. l. 15. But the translation is not at
all happy.

16. _Wot it_: 'Scitne, quod appetit anxia nosse?'

18. _seith thus_: 'Sed quis nota scire laborat? At si nescit, quid caeca
petit? Quis enim quidquam nescius optet?'

23. _or who_: 'Aut quis ualeat nescita sequi? Quoue inueniat, quisue
repertam Queat ignarus noscere formam?'

26. _But whan_: not a statement, as here taken, but a question. 'An cùm
mentem cerneret altam Pariter summam et singula norat?' The translation is
quite incorrect, and the passage is difficult. The reference seems to be to
the supposition that the soul, apart from the body, sees both universals
and particulars, but its power in the latter respect is impeded by the
body; ideas taken from Plato's Meno and Phædo.

32, 33. _withholdeth_, retains: 'tenet.' _singularitees_, particulars:
'singula.'

34. _in neither nother_, put for _in ne either ne other_, i.e. not in one
nor in the other; or, in modern English, 'he is neither in one position nor
the other': 'Neutro est habitu.' This curious phrase is made clearer by
comparing it with the commoner _either other_. Thus, in P. Plowman, B. v.
148: '_either_ despiseth _other_'; in the same, B. v. 164: '_eyther_ hitte
_other_'; and again, in B. xi. 173: 'that alle manere men .. Louen her
_eyther other_'; and, in B. vii. 138: 'apposeden _either other_'; and
lastly, in B. xvi. 207: '_either_ is _otheres_ Ioye.'

36. _retreteth_, reconsiders: 'altè uisa _retractans_.'

PROSE 4. 2. _Marcus Tullius_, i.e. Cicero; De Diuinatione, lib. ii. 60.

8. _moeven to_: 'ad diuinae praescientiae simplicitatem non potest
admoueri.'

15. _y-spended_, spent; but the right sense of the Latin is weighed or
considered: 'si prius ea quibus moueris, _expendero_.'

22. _from elles-where_: 'aliunde'; compare Chaucer's gloss.

24. _unbityde_, not happen: 'non euenire non possunt.'

27. _thou thyself._ The reference is to Bk. v. Pr. 3. l. 27, above--'ne it
ne bihoveth nat, nedes, that thinges bityden that ben purvyed.'

28, 9. _what cause_: 'quid est, quod uoluntarii exitus rerum ad certum
cogantur euentum?' _endes_, results: 'exitus;' and so again below.

30. _by grace of position_, for the sake of a supposition, by way of
supposition: 'positionis gratia.' Cf. Chaucer's use of _pose_ for 'suppose'
in the next line. The reading _possessioun_ (in both MSS.) is obviously
wrong; it sounds as if taken down from dictation.

31. _I pose_, I suppose, I put the case: 'statuamus nullam esse
praescientiam.' The words 'per impossibile' are inserted by Chaucer, and
mean, 'to take an impossible case.'

56. _But, certes, right_; only, indeed, just as, &c. It is difficult to
give the right force intended; and, probably, Chaucer quite mistook the
sense. 'Quasi uero nos ea, quae prouidentia futura esse praenoscit, non
esse euentura credamus.'

62. _in the torninge_: 'in quadrigis moderandis atque flectendis.'

63. _And by_: 'atque ad hunc modum caetera.'

100. _and for that this thing shal mowen shewen_, and in order that this
may appear (lit. may be able to appear). The whole clause merely
means--'And to make this clearer by an easy example.' Lat. 'Nam ut hoc
breui liqueat exemplo.'

101. _roundnesse_ is here in the objective case: 'eandem corporis
rotunditatem aliter uisus aliter tactus agnoscit.'

107. _And the man_: 'Ipsum quoque hominem.' _wit_, i.e. sense. The 'five
wits' were the five senses.

113. _spece_, species. _peces_, parts; _in the singuler peces_, i.e. in the
particular parts.

114. _intelligence_, understanding; 'intelligentiae.'

115. _universitee_, that which is universal: 'uniuersitatis ambitum.'

133. _by a strok_: 'illo uno ictu mentis formaliter.'

137. _diffinissheth_, defines the universality of her conception.

METRE 4. 1. _The Porche_; in Latin, _Porticus_; in Gk. [Greek: stoa], a
roofed colonnade or porch in Athens, frequented by Zeno and his followers,
who hence obtained the name of Stoics.

 'Quondam Porticus attulit Obscuros nimium senes,
  Qui sensus, et imagines E corporibus extimis
  Credant mentibus imprimi.'

10. TEXT. The Latin text continues thus:--

 'Vt quondam celeri stilo Mos est aequore paginae
  Quae nullas habeat notas, Pressas figere litteras.'

11. _pointel_; see note to Somn. Tale, D 1742. And cf. Troilus, i. 365;
Cant. Ta. E 1581, 2.

15. _But yif_:

 'Sed mens si propriis uigens Nihil motibus explicat
  Sed tantùm patiens iacet Notis subdita corporum,
  Cassasque in speculi uicem Rerum reddit imagines.
  Vnde haec sic animis uiget Cernens omnia notio?
  Quae uis singula prospicit, Aut quae cognita diuidit?
  Quae diuisa recolligit, Alternumque legens iter
  Nunc summis caput inserit, Nunc desidit in infima,
  Tum sese referens sibi, Veris falsa redarguit?'

32. _passioun_, passive feeling, impression: 'passio.'

PROSE 5. 1. _But what yif ... and al be it so_, Nevertheless, even if it be
so: 'Quod si ... quamuis.'

4. _entalenten_, affect, incline, stimulate: 'afficiant.'

18. _For the wit_, i.e. the sense, the external senses.

21. _as oystres ... see_: the Latin merely has: 'quales sunt conchae
maris.'

23. _remuable_, capable of motion from place to place: 'mobilibus belluis.'

_talent_, inclination, desire, wish: 'affectus.'

30. _But how ... yif that_, but how will it be if?

33. _that that that_, that _that_ thing which.

35. _ne that ther nis_, so that there is: 'nec quicquam esse sensibile.'

49. _maner stryvinge_, sort of strife: 'In huiusmodi igitur lite.'

62. _parsoneres_, partners of, endowed with. The modern _partner_
represents the M. E. _parcener_, variant of _parsoner_, from O. F.
_parsonier_, representing a Latin form _*partitionarius_. Lat.
'participes.'

66. _For which_: 'Quare in illius summae intelligentiae cacumen, si
possumus, erigamur.'

METRE 5. 1. _passen by_, move over: 'permeant.'

6. _by moist fleeinge_: 'liquido ... uolatu.' _gladen hemself_, delight:
'gaudent.'

7. _with hir goings ... feet_: 'gressibus.'

9. _to walken under_, to enter: 'subire.'

10. _enclined_, i.e. enclined earthwards: 'Prona.'

11. _hevieth_, oppresses: 'Prona tamen facies hebetes ualet ingrauare
sensus.' From Aristotle, On the Parts of Animals, Bk. iv. [Greek: Dio
pleionos genomenou tou barous kai tou sômatôdous, anankê rhepein ta sômata
pros tên gên] (chap. 10). As to the upright carriage of man, see the same
chapter. Cf. Ovid, Met. i. 84, and see note to Chaucer's 'Truth,' l. 19.

12. _light_, i.e. not bowed down: 'leuis recto stat corpore.'

14. _axest_, seemest to seek: 'caelum ... petis.'

PROSE 6. 21. _as Aristotle demed_; in De Caelo, lib. i.

33. _present_: 'et sui compos praesens sibi semper assistere.'

42. _Plato._ This notion is found in Proclus and Plotinus, and other
followers of Plato; but Plato himself really expressed a contrary opinion,
viz. that the world had a definite beginning. See his Timæus.

48. _For this ilke_: 'Hunc enim uitae immobilis praesentarium statum
infinitus ille temporalium rerum motus imitatur; cumque eum effingere atque
aequare non possit, ex immobilitate deficit in motum, et ex simplicitate
praesentiae decrescit in infinitam futuri ac praeteriti quantitatem;' &c.

53. _disencreseth_; a clumsy form for _decreseth_: 'decrescit.'

65. _therfor it_: 'infinitum temporis iter arripuit.'

81. _it is science_: 'sed scientiam nunquam deficientis instantiae rectius
aestimabis.'

82. _For which_: 'Unde non praeuidentia, sed prouidentia, potius dicitur.'
The footnote to l. 83 is wrong, as Dr. Furnivall's reprint of MS. C. is
here at fault. That MS. (like MS. Ii. 1. 38) has here the correct reading
'p_re_uydence,' without any gloss at all. The gloss 'p_ro_uidentia' belongs
to the word 'purviaunce.' Hence the reading 'previdence,' which I thought
to be unsupported, is really supported by two good MSS.

86. _Why axestow ... thanne_: 'Quid igitur postulas?'

112. _he ne unwot_: 'quod idem exsistendi necessitate carere non nesciat.'

116. _it ne may nat unbityde_: 'id non euenire non posse.'

119. _but unnethe_: 'sed cui uix aliquis nisi diuini speculator
accesserit.'

150, 1. _in beinge_, in coming to pass: 'exsistendo.'

_by the which_: 'qua prius quam fierent, etiam non euenire potuissent.' MS.
C. has the contraction for 'que,' i.e. 'quae'; but Chaucer clearly adopted
the reading 'qua.' The usual reading is 'quia' or 'quae.'

154. _so as they comen_, since they come: 'cum ... eueniant.'

159. _the sonne arysinge._ See above, p. 148, l. 102: 'Right so,' &c.

185. _And thilke_: 'illa quoque noscendi uices alternare uideatur?'

191. _For the devyne_: 'Omne namque futurum diuinus praecurrit intuitus, et
ad praesentiam propriae cognitionis retorquet ac reuocat.' Hence _retorneth
hem_ means 'makes them return.'

193. _ne he ne_: 'nec alternat, ut existimas, nunc hoc, nunc illud
praenoscendi uices; sed uno ictu mutationes tuas manens praeuenit atque
complectitur.'

199. _a litel her-biforn._ See above, Bk. v. Pr. 3, ll. 62-65; &c.

207. _purposen_, propose, assign: 'proponunt.'

208. _to the willinges_: 'solutis omni necessitate uoluntatibus.'

211. _renneth ... with_, concurs with: 'concurrit.'

214. _put_, set: 'positae.' _that ne mowen_: 'quae cum rectae sunt,
inefficaces esse non possunt.'

217. _areys thy corage_: 'animum subleuate.' _yilde_: 'humiles preces in
excelsa porrigite.'

220. _sin that ye_: 'cum ante oculos agitis iudicis cuncta cernentis.' With
the word 'cernentis' the Lat. treatise ends.

The words--'To whom ... Amen' occur in the Cambridge MS. only; and, in all
probability, were merely added by the scribe. However, the Latin copy in
that MS. adds, after 'cernentis,' the following: 'Qui est dominus noster
Iesus Christus, cui sit honor et gloria in secula seculorum. AMEN.'




NOTES TO TROILUS.


BOOK I.

I must refer the student to Mr. Rossetti's work (Chaucer Soc. 1875) for a
detailed comparison of Chaucer's poem with the _Filostrato_ of Boccaccio.
The following table roughly indicates the portions of these works which are
more or less similar, down to the end of Book I. Similar tables are
prefixed to the Notes on the other books. It often happens that a stanza in
Chaucer has a mere general resemblance to the corresponding one in
Boccaccio. The lines in Chaucer not mentioned below are, in the main,
original; e.g. 1-20, 31-56, &c.; and so are many others that cannot be here
more exactly specified.

  CHAUCER: BOOK I.          FILOSTRATO.

  ll. 21-30.                Bk. I. St. V, VI.
      57-213.               VII-XXV.
      267-329.              XXVI-XXXII. 6.

      897-900.              XXIII. 1-3.
      967-1060.             XXIV-XXXIV.

2. 'That was the son of King Priam of Troy.'

5. _fro ye_, from you; observe the rime. The form _ye_ is not here the nom.
case, but the _unemphatic form_ of the acc. _you_; pronounced (y[*e]),
where ([*e]) is the indefinite vowel, like the _a_ in _China_. So in Shak.
Two Gent. iv. 1. 3, 4, we have _about ye_ (unemphatic) in l. 3, and _you_
twice in l. 4.

6. _Thesiphone_, Tisiphone, one of the Furies, invoked as being a 'goddess
of torment.' Cf. '_furial_ pyne of helle,' Sq. Ta. F 448.

13. _fere_, companion; viz. Tisiphone.

16. 'Nor dare pray to Love,' &c.

21. Cf. Boccaccio: 'Tuo sia l'onore, e mio si sia l'affanno,' Fil. I. st.
5. And see ll. 1042, 3 below.

57. Here begins the story; cf. Fil. I. st. 7. Bell remarks that 'a thousand
shippes,' in l. 58, may have been suggested by 'mille carinae' in Verg. Æn.
ii. 198; cf. 'anni decem' in the same line, with l. 60.

67. Read _éxpert_. _Calkas_ is Homer's Calchas, Il. i. 69. He was a Greek,
but Guido makes him a Trojan, putting him in the place of Homer's Chryses.
See the allit. Troy-book, 7886.

70. _Delphicus_, of Delphi; cf. Ovid, Met. ii. 543.

77. _Ye_, yea. _wolde who-so nolde_, whoever wished it or did not wish it.
This idiomatic phrase is thus expressed in the MSS. Bell's edition has
_wold who so or nolde_, where the _e_ in _wolde_ is suppressed and the word
_or_ inserted without authority. I hesitate, as an editor, to alter an
idiomatic phrase. Cf. _will he, nill he_, in which there is no _or_.

91. 'Deserve to be burnt, both skin and bones.'

99. _Criseyde_; Boccaccio has _Griseida_, answering to Homer's [Greek:
Chrysêida], Il. i. 143. It was common, in the Middle Ages, to adopt the
accusative form as the standard one, especially in proper names. Her father
was Chryses; see note to l. 67. But Benoît de Sainte-Maure calls her
_Briseida_, and _Chryseis_ and _Briseis_ seem to have been confused. The
allit. Troy-book has _Bresaide_; l. 8029.

119. 'While it well pleases you'; _good_ is used adverbially. Ital. 'mentre
t' aggrada.'

125. 'And would have done so oftener, if,' &c.

126. _and hoom_, and (went) home.

132, 133. This is a curious statement, and Chaucer's object in making it is
not clear. Boccaccio says expressly that she had neither son nor daughter
(st. 15); and Benoît (l. 12977) calls her 'la pucele.'

136. _som day_, one day; used quite generally.

138. 'And thus Fortune wheeled both of them up and down again.' Alluding to
the wheel of Fortune; see the Ballade on Fortune, l. 46, and note.

145. _Troyane gestes_, Trojan history; cf. the title of Guido delle
Colonne's book, viz. 'Historia Troiana,' which Chaucer certainly consulted,
as shewn by several incidents in the poem.

146. _Omer_, Homer; whose account was considered untrustworthy by the
medieval writers; see Ho. Fame, 1477, and note. _Dares_, Dares Phrygius;
_Dyte_, Dictys Cretensis; see notes to Ho. Fame, 1467, 1468. These three
authors really mean Guido delle Colonne, who professed to follow them.

153. _Palladion_, the Palladium or sacred image of Pallas, on the keeping
of which the safety of Troy depended. It was stolen from Troy by Diomede
and Ulysses; see Æneid, ii. 166. But Chaucer doubtless read the long
account in Guido delle Colonne.

171. Hence Henrysoun, in his Testament of Criseyde, st. 12, calls her 'the
flower and A-per-se Of Troy and Greece.' Cf. 'She was a woman A-per-se,
alon'; Romance of Partenay, 1148. Boccaccio's image is much finer; he says
that she surpassed other women as the rose does the violet. On the other
hand, l. 175 is Chaucer's own.

172. _makelees_, matchless, peerless; cf. A.S. _gemaca_.

189. _lakken_, to blame; see P. Pl. B. v. 132.

192. _bayten_, feed, feast (metaphorically); E. _bait_.

205. _Ascaunces_, as if; in l. 292, the Ital. text has _Quasi dicesse_, as
if she said. See Cant. Ta. D 1745, G 838. It is tautological, being formed
from E. _as_ and the O.F. _quanses_, as if (Godefroy); so that the literal
force is 'as as if.'

210. 'And nevertheless [or, still] he (Cupid) can pluck as proud a peacock
(as was Troilus).' Cf. Prol. A 652.

214-266. These lines are Chaucer's own.

217. _falleth_, happens; _ne wenden_, would not expect. In Ray's Proverbs,
ed. 1737, p. 279, is a Scotch proverb--'All fails that fools thinks'
(_sic_); which favours the alternative reading given in the footnote.

218. _Bayard_, a name for a bay horse; see Can. Yem. Ta. G 1413.

229. _wex a-fere_, became on fire. _Fere_ is a common Southern form, as a
variant of _fyre_, though _a-fyre_ occurs in Ho. Fame, 1858. The A.S. vowel
is _[=y]_, the A.S. form being _f[=y]r_.

239. 'Has proved (to be true), and still does so.'

257. 'The stick that will bend and ply is better than one that breaks.'
Compare the fable of the Oak and the Reed; see bk. ii. 1387.

266. _ther-to refere_, revert thereto. Halliwell gives: '_Refeere_, to
revert; _Hoccleve_.' Chaucer here ends his own remarks, and goes back to
the _Filostrato_.

292. _Ascaunces_, as if (she said); see note to l. 205.

316. _awhaped_, amazed, stupefied; see Anelida, 215; Leg. of Good Women,
132, 814, 2321; he was 'not utterly confounded,' but only dazed; cf. l.
322.

327. _borneth_, burnishes, polishes up; i.e. makes bright and cheerful. The
rime shews that it is a variant spelling of _burneth_; cf. _burned_,
burnished, Ho. Fame, 1387; Kn. Ta. A 1983.

MS. Harl. 3943 has _vnournith_, an error for _anorneth_, adorns; with a
like sense.

333. _Him tit_, to him betideth; _tit_ is for _tydeth_.

336. _ordre_, sect, brotherhood; a jesting allusion to the religious
orders. So also _ruled_ = under a religious rule.

337. _noun-certeyn_, uncertainty; cf. O.F. _noncerteit_, uncertainty
(Godefroy); _nounpower_, want of power (P. Plowman); and F. _nonchalance_.
Again spelt _noun-certeyn_, Compl. Venus, 46.

340. _lay_, law, ordinance; see Sq. Ta. F 18.

344. 'But observe this--that which ye lovers often avoid, or else do with a
good intention, often will thy lady misconstrue it,' &c.

363. _a temple_, i.e. in the temple.

381. _First_ stands alone in the first foot. Cf. ll. 490, 603, 811.

385. _Yelt_, short for _yeldeth_, yields.

394. _writ_, writeth. _Lollius_; Chaucer's reason for the use of this name
is not known. Perhaps we may agree with Dr. Latham, who suggested (in a
letter to the _Athenæum_, Oct. 3, 1868, p. 433), that Chaucer misread this
line in Horace (_Epist._ i. 2. 1), viz. 'Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime
_Lolli_'; and thence derived the notion that Lollius wrote on the Trojan
war. This becomes the more likely if we suppose that he merely saw this
line quoted apart from the context. Chaucer does not seem to have read
Horace for himself. As a matter of fact, ll. 400-420 are translated from
the 88th sonnet of Petrarch. See note to Ho. of Fame, 1468. The following
is the text of Petrarch's sonnet:

 'S'amor non è, che dunque è quel ch' i'sento?
      Ma s'egli è amor, per Dio, che cosa e quale?
      Se buona, ond' è l'effetto aspro mortale?
      Se ria, ond' è si dolce ogni tormento?
  S'a mia voglia ardo, ond' è 'l pianto e'l lamento?
      S'a mal mia grado, il lamentar che vale?
      O viva morte, o dilettoso male,
      Come puoi tanto in me s'io nol consento?
  E s'io 'l consento, a gran torto mi doglio.
      Fra si contrari venti, in frale barca
      Mi trovo in alto mar, senza governo.
  Sì lieve di saver, d'error sì carca
      Ch' i' medesmo non so quel ch'io mi voglio,
      E tremo a mezza state, ardendo il verno.'

In l. 401, _whiche_ means 'of what kind.'

425. Ital. text--'Non so s'io dico a donna, ovvero a dea'; Fil. I. 38. Cf.
Æneid, i. 327. Hence the line in Kn. Ta. A 1101.

457. _That_; in modern E., we should use _But_, or else _said not_ for
_seyde_.

463. _Fled-de_ is here a plural form, the pp. being treated as an
adjective. Cf. _sprad-de_, iv. 1422; _whet-te_, v. 1760.

464. _savacioun_; Ital. 'salute.' Mr. Rossetti thinks that _salute_ here
means 'well-being' or 'health'; and perhaps _savacioun_ is intended to mean
the same, the literal sense being 'safety.'

465. _fownes_, fawns; see Book of the Duch. 429. It is here used,
metaphorically, to mean 'young desires' or 'fresh yearnings.' This image is
not in Boccaccio.

470. I take the right reading to be _felle_, as in Cm. Ed., with the sense
'destructive.' As it might also mean 'happened,' other MSS. turned it into
_fille_, which makes a most awkward construction. The sense is: 'The sharp
destructive assaults of the proof of arms [i.e. which afforded proof of
skill in fighting], which Hector and his other brothers performed, not once
made him move on _that_ account only'; i.e. when he exerted himself, it was
not for mere fighting's sake. Chaucer uses _fel_ elsewhere; the pl. _felle_
is in Troil. iv. 44; and see Cant. Ta. D 2002, B 2019. For _preve_, proof,
see l. 690.

473, 4. _riden_ and _abiden_ (with short _i_) rime with _diden_, and are
past tenses plural. l. 474 is elliptical: 'found (to be) one of the best,
and (one of those who) longest abode where peril was.'

483. _the deeth_, i.e. the pestilence, the plague.

488. _title_, a name; he said it was 'a fever.'

517. _daunce_, i.e. company of dancers. Cf. Ho. Fame, 639, 640.

530-2. 'For, by my hidden sorrow, (when it is) blased abroad, I shall be
befooled more, a thousand times, than the fool of whose folly men write
rimes.' No particular reference seems to be intended by l. 532; the Ital.
text merely has 'più ch' altro,' more than any one.

557. _attricioun_, attrition. 'An imperfect sorrow for sin, as if a
bruising which does not amount to utter crushing (_contrition_); horror of
sin through fear of punishment ... while _contrition_ has its motive in the
love of God;' New E. Dict.

559. _ley on presse_, compress, diminish; cf. Prol. A 81.

560. _holinesse_, the leanness befitting a holy state.

626. 'That one, whom excess causes to fare very badly.'

631-679. Largely original; but, for l. 635, see note to Bk. III. 329.

638-644. There is a like passage in P. Pl. C. xxi. 209-217. Chaucer,
however, here follows Le Roman de la Rose, 21819-40, q.v.

648. _amayed_, dismayed; O.F. _esmaier_. So in Bk. IV. l. 641.

654. _Oënone_ seems to have four syllables. MS. H. has _Oonone_; MS. Cm.
_senome_ (over an erasure); MS. Harl. 3943, _Tynome_. Alluding to the
letter of _Oenone_ to Paris in Ovid, Heroid. v.

659-665. Not at all a literal translation, but it gives the general sense
of Heroid. v. 149-152:

 'Me miseram, quod amor non est medicabilis herbis!
     Deficior prudens artis ab arte mea.
   Ipse repertor opis uaccas pauisse Pheraeas
     Fertur, et a nostro saucius igne fuit.'

_Ipse repertor opis_ means Phoebus, who 'first fond art of medicyne;'
_Pheraeas_, i.e. of Pherae, refers to Pherae in Thessaly, the residence of
king Admetus. Admetus gained Alcestis for his wife by the assistance of
Apollo, who, according to some accounts, served Admetus out of attachment
to him, or, according to other accounts, because he was condemned to serve
a mortal for a year. Chaucer seems to adopt a theory that Apollo loved
Admetus chiefly for his daughter's sake. The usual story about Apollo is
his love for Daphne.

674. 'Even though I had to die by torture;' cf. Kn. Ta. A 1133.

686. 'Until it pleases him to desist.'

688. 'To mistrust every one, or to believe every one.'

694. _The wyse_, Solomon; see Eccles. iv. 10.

699. _Niobe_; 'lacrimas etiamnum marmora manant;' Ovid, Met. vi. 311.

705. 'That eke out (increase) their sorrows,' &c.

707. 'And care not to seek for themselves another cure.'

708. A proverb; see note to Can. Yem. Ta. G 746.

713. _harde grace_, misfortune; cf. Cant. Ta. G 665, 1189. Tyrwhitt quotes
Euripides, Herc. Furens, 1250: [Greek: Gemô kakôn dê, kouket' esth' hopou
tethê].

730, 731. From Boethius, Bk. I. Pr. 2. l. 14, and Pr. 4. l. 2.

739. 'On whose account he fared so.'

740. Compare: 'He makes a rod for his own breech'; Hazlitt's Proverbs.

745. 'For it (love) would sufficiently spring to light of itself.'

747. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 7595-6.

763. 'But they do not care to seek a remedy.'

780. Pronounced _ben'cite_; see note to Cant. Ta. B 1170.

786. _Ticius_, Tityos. MS. H2. wrongly has _Siciphus_. 'The fowl that
highte _voltor_, that eteth the stomak or the giser of Tityus, is so
fulfild of his song that it nil eten ne tyren no more;' tr. of Boeth. Bk.
III. Met. 12. 28. The original has:

 'Vultur, dum satur est modis,
  Non traxit Tityi iecur.'

See also Verg. Æn. vi. 595; Ovid, Met. iv. 456.

811. First foot deficient, as in ll. 603, 1051, 1069, &c. _winter_, years.
Perhaps imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 21145-9.

846, 847. See Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 3. 52-54.

848. From Boethius, Lib. II. Pr. 1: 'si manere incipit, fors esse
desistit.' See p. 26 above, l. 83.

887. 'And, to augment all this the more.'

890-966. This is all Chaucer's own; so also 994-1008.

916. _a blaunche fevere_, a fever that turns men white; said jocosely.
Lovers were supposed to be pale; Ovid, Art. Am. i. 729. Cotgrave is
somewhat more precise. He gives: '_Fievres blanches_, the agues wherewith
maidens that have the green sickness are troubled; hence, _Il a les fievres
blanches_, either he is in love, or sick of wantonness.' In the Cuckoo and
the Nightingale, l. 41, we find: 'I am so shaken with _the feveres white_.'

932. _beet_; beat thy breast (to shew thy repentance). Cf. P. Plowm. B. v.
454.

956. A proverb. 'The more haste, the worse speed (success).' Cf. Bk. iii.
1567, and The Tale of Melibeus, B 2244.

964. Dr. Köppel says--cf. Albertano of Brescia, Liber de Amore Dei, 45b:
'Iam et Seneca dixit, Non conualescit planta, quae saepe transfertur.'

969. 'A bon port estes arrivés'; Rom. de la Rose, 12964.

977. Fil. ii. st. 27: 'Io credo certo, ch' ogni donna in voglia Viva
amorosa.'

1000. _post_, pillar, support; as in Prol. A 214.

1002. Cf. 'The greater the sinner, the greater the saint.'

1011. Understand _he_. 'He became, as one may say, untormented of his wo.'

1024. _cherl_, man. 'You are afraid the man will fall out of the moon!'
Alluding to the old notion that the spots on the moon's surface represent a
man with a bundle of sticks. See the curious poem on this subject in
Wright's Specimens of Lyric Poetry, p. 110; also printed in Ritson's
Ancient Songs, i. 68, and in Böddeker's Altenglische Dichtungen, p. 176,
where a fear is expressed that the man may fall out of the moon. Cf. Temp.
ii. 2. 141; Mids. Nt. Dr. v. 1. 249; and see Alex. Neckam, ed. Wright, pp.
xviii, 54.

1026. 'Why, meddle with that which really concerns you,' i.e. mind your own
business. Some copies needlessly turn this into a question and insert _ne_
before _hast_.

1038. 'And am I to be thy surety?'

1050. _Scan_: 'And yet m' athink'th ... m'asterte.' The sense is: 'And yet
it repents me that this boast should escape me.'

1051. Deficient in the first foot: 'Now | Pandáre.' So in l. 1069.

1052. 'But thou, being wise, thou knowest,' &c. In this line, _thou_ seems
to be emphatic throughout.

1058. Read _désiróus_; as in Book ii. 1101, and Sq. Ta. F 23.

1070. _Pandare_ is here trisyllabic; with unelided _-e_.

1078. The same line occurs in the Clerk. Ta. E 413.

1088. 'And is partly well eased of the aching of his wound, yet is none the
more healed; and, like an easy patient (i.e. a patient not in pain), awaits
(lit. abides) the prescription of him that tries to cure him; and thus he
perseveres in his destiny.' _Dryveth forth_ means 'goes on with,' or 'goes
through with.' The reading _dryeth_, i.e. endures, is out of place here, as
it implies suffering; whereas, at the present stage, Troilus is extremely
hopeful.

  1305-1351.                128-131.

Other passages are mainly original; as, e.g. ll. 1352-1757 at the end, and
1-264 at the beginning.

1-3. These lines somewhat resemble Dante, Purgat. i. 1-3.

 'Per correr miglior acqua alza le vele
  Omai la navicella del mio ingegno,
  Che lascia dietro a sè mar sì crudele;' &c.

7. _calendes_, the introduction to the beginning; see bk. v. l. 1634. Thus
the 'kalends of January' precede that month, being the period from Dec. 14
to Dec. 31.

8. _Cleo_; so in most copies; H2. has _Clyo_; Clio, the muse of history.

14. _Latin_ seems, in this case, to mean Italian, which was called _Latino
volgare_.

21. 'A blind man cannot judge well of colours;' a proverb.

22. Doubtless from Horace's Ars Poetica, 71-3; probably borrowed at
second-hand.

28. A proverb. In the Proverbs of Hendyng, l. 29, we have: 'Ase fele thede,
ase fele thewes,' i.e. so many peoples, so many customs. See l. 42 below.
Cf. Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 7. 49 (p. 47).

36. _went_, for _wendeth_; i.e. goes; pres. tense.

46. 'Yet all is told, or must be told.'

48. _bitit_, for _bitydeth_; i.e. betides, happens.

55. _Bole_, Bull, the sign Taurus. On the third of May, in Chaucer's time,
the sun would be in about the 20th degree of Taurus. The epithet _white_ is
from Ovid, Met. ii. 852.

63. _wente_, sb., a turn; i.e. he tossed about.

64-68. _forshapen_, metamorphosed. Progne was changed into a swallow; Ovid,
Met. vi. 668. Tereus carried off Progne's sister Philomela; see Leg. of
Good Women (Philomela).

74. 'And knew that the moon was in a good plight (position) for him to take
his journey.' That is, the moon's position was propitious; see note to Man
of Lawes Tale, B 312.

77. '_Janus_, god of (the) entry;' see Ovid, Fasti, i. 125.

81. 'And found (that) she and two other ladies were sitting.' _Sete_ (A. S.
_s[=æ]ton_) is the pt. t. pl., not the pp.

84. The celebrated story of the Siege of Thebes, known to Chaucer through
the Thebais of Statius; see bk. v. 1484. And see l. 100.

poem.

103. _lettres rede_, i.e. the rubric describing the contents of the next

Oedipus contended for Thebes. For _Amphiorax_, see note to bk. v. 1500, and
to Anelida, 57.

108. _bokes twelve_; the 12 Books of the Thebais. The death of Amphioraus
is related at the end of Book vii.

110. _barbe_, 'part of a woman's dress, still sometimes worn by nuns,
consisting of a piece of white plaited linen, passed over or under the
chin, and reaching midway to the waist;' New E. Dict. She wore it because
she was a widow; see the quotations in the New E. Dict., esp. 'wearing of
_barbes_ at funerals.' And see _Barbuta_ in Ducange.

112. 'Let us perform some rite in honour of May;' see note to Kn. Ta. A
1500.

117. The right reading is necessarily _sete_, for A. S. _s[=æ]te_, 3 p. s.
pt. t. subj. of _sitten_; 'it would befit.' Cf. _seten_, they sat, 81,
1192.

134. 'And I am your surety,' i.e. you may depend upon me; see bk. i. 1038.

151. _unkouth_, unknown, strange; hence, very; Sc. _unco'_.

154. _wal_, wall, defence; _yerde_, rod, scourge, as in bk. i. 740.

167. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 5684-6:--

 'Lucan redit, qui moult fu sages,
  C'onques _vertu et grant pooir_
  Ne pot nus _ensemble veoir_.'

Cf. Lucan, Phar. i. 92.

171.

318. _Which ... his_, whose; cf. _that ... his_, Kn. Ta. A 2710.

344. Gems were supposed to have hidden virtues.

387. _fele_, find out, investigate.

391, 2. Cf. Ovid, Art. Amat. ii. 107: 'Ut ameris, amabilis esto.'

396. 'Go and love; for, when old, no one will have you.'

398. 'I am warned too late, when it has past away, quoth Beauty.'

arbitrary form appears in Parl. Foules, 348.

539. 'Because men cover them up,' &c.

586. _were never_, never would be; _were_ is in the subjunctive mood.

611. _Thascry_, for _The ascry_, the alarm. _Ascry_ occurs in Wyclif, Prov.
vii. 6.

615. _latis_, lattice. The reading _yates_, gates, is wrong, as shewn by l.
617.

618. Dardanus, ancestor of Priam. Cf. _Dardanidae_, i. e. Trojans, Verg.
Aen. i. 560, ii. 72, &c. Troy had six gates, according to Guido; the
strongest of these was _Dardanus_; see the allit. Destruction of Troy, ed.
Panton and Donaldson, l. 1557, Lydgate, Siege of Troy, b. ii. c. 11, and
Shakespeare's Prologue to his Troilus.

_ther open is the cheyne_, where the chain is open, or unfastened. Alluding
to the chains sometimes drawn across a street, to block it against
horsemen. The sense is, 'he will come down _this_ street, because the
others are blocked.'

621. _happy_, fortunate. It was a lucky day for him.

627. _a pas_, at a foot-pace; see Prol. A 825, and l. 620 above.

A curious idiom.

666. _envýous_, envious person; accented on _y_, as in l. 857.

677. _Ma | de_; two syllables. The first foot is imperfect.

681. The astrological term 'house' has two senses; it sometimes means a
zodiacal sign, as when, e.g. Taurus is called the 'house' or mansion of
Venus; and sometimes it has another sense, as, probably, in the present
passage. See Chaucer's treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 37, on 'the
equations of houses.' In the latter case, the whole celestial sphere was
divided into twelve equal parts, called 'houses,' by great circles passing
through the north and south points of the horizon. The first of these,
reckoning upwards from the eastern horizon, was called the _first_ house,
and the _seventh_ house, being opposite to it, was reckoned downwards from
the western horizon. The _first_ and _seventh_ houses were both considered
very fortunate; and it is here said that Venus was in her seventh house,
i.e. was just below the western horizon at the moment when Criseyde first
saw him. The same planet was also 'well disposed,' i.e. in a favourable
sign of the zodiac; and at the same time was 'pleased (or made propitious)
by favourable aspects' of other planets, i.e. other planets were favourably
situated as regards their angular distances from Venus. Moreover, Venus was
no foe to Troilus in his nativity, i.e. she was also favourably situated at
the moment of his birth.

716. Imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 5765-9, q.v.

746. 'I am one (who is) the fairest.' The _-e_ in _fairest-e_ is not
elided; neither is the _-e_ in _wist-e_ in l. 745.

750. I.e. 'I am my own mistress.'

752. _lese_, pasture; 'I stand, unfastened, in a pleasant pasture.' From A.
S. _l[=æ]su_. Cf. Ho. Fame, 1768. It does not mean 'leash,' as usually
said; Chaucer's form of 'leash' is _lees_, as in Cant. Ta. G 19.

754. _chekmat_, check-mate, as in chess; see Book Duch. 659. Bell sees a
pun in it; '_check_ to my _mate_,' i.e. wife; but it remains to be shewn
that the form _mate_ (wife) was known to Chaucer, who spells it _make_
(Cant. Ta. E 2080).

759. I.e. 'I am not a nun,' nor vowed to chastity.

767, 769. _sprat_, for _spredeth_, spreads, pres. t.; _spradde_, pt. t. Cf.
Boethius, Bk. i. Met. 3. 9-12.

777. According to Bell, MS. Harl. 1239 also has _why_, i.e. wherefore, a
reason why, cause.

784. Cf. 'S'il fait folie, si la boive;' Rom. Rose, 12844.

797. 'No one stumbles over it;' for it is too unsubstantial.

802. 'Yet all things seem to them to be harmful, wherein folks please their
friends.'

807. 'Nothing venture, nothing have.'

830. _hertes lust_, heart's pleasure; _to rente_, by way of rent.

831. _no wight_, to no one; dat. case.

861. See Hazlitt's notes on the proverb--'Many talk of Robin Hood, that
never shot in his bow,' &c.

866. 'Who cannot endure sorrow deserves no joy.'

867. 'And therefore let him, who has a glass head, beware of stones cast in
battle.'

882. _let_, short for _ledeth_, leads (Stratmann).

884. The MSS. end the line with _syke_. It has been pointed out that _syke_
is not a perfect rime to _endyte_, _whyte_, but only an assonance. It is
difficult to believe Chaucer guilty of this oversight; and hence I would
suggest, with all submission to the critics, that possibly Chaucer wrote
_syte_. The M. E. _syte_ means to be anxious, and occurs in the Cursor
Mundi, 11675; where Joseph says to Mary:--'Bot I _site_ for an other thing
That we o water has nu wanting,' i.e. but I am anxious about another thing,
that we lack water. The sb. _site_, grief, occurs in the Midland dialect as
well as in Northumbrian; see _site_ in Stratmann. As the word is unusual,
it would naturally be altered by the scribes to the familiar _syke_, to
sigh, with a cognate meaning.

920. 'And loude he song ageyn the sonne shene;' Kn. Ta. A 1509.

959. 'Unless lack of pursuit is the cause (of failure),' &c.; cf. 1075.

964. _hameled_, cut off, docked; cf. P. Pl. Crede, 300.

1001. 'Your ill hap is not owing to me.'

1017. Read _And úpon mé_, where _me_ is emphatic.

1022. When people's ears glow, it is because they are being talked of;
according to folk-lore. See Brand's Popular Antiquities, ed. Ellis, iii.
171.

1026. 'Sed lateant uires, nec sis in fronte disertus;' Ovid, Art. Am. i.
463.

1027. 'Quascunque adspicies, lacrimae fecere lituras;' Ovid, Heroid. iii.
3.

1033. 'Or always harp one tune.'

1041. 'Humano capiti,' &c.; Horace, Ars Poet. 1-5. _pyk_, a pike (fish), as
in the Balade to Rosemounde, 17.

1062. Accent _Mínervá_ on the first and third syllables.

1075-7. _it made_, was the cause of it. _ley_, lied.

1107. _hoppe_, dance. 'I always dance in the rear.'

1108. _to-laugh_ (H2, _to lagh_, Cm. _to law_), laughed exceedingly. I know
of no other example. A better form is _to-lough_; see l. 1163, and Pard.
Ta. C 476.

1119. _spek-e_, might speak, should say; pt. t. subjunctive.

1123. _sent_, i. e. _sendeth_, sends; the pt. t. is _sent-e_ or _send-e_.

1177-8. _Avysed_, she took notice; pt. tense. So also _fond_, found, which
Bell takes to be a pp.; but the pp. is _founden_. _Coude good_, knew what
was becoming. So, in l. 1197, _Can he_ means 'has he skill.'

1201, 1204. _sowe_, to sew the pieces of parchment together. Tyrwhitt
remarks, s. v. _sowe_; 'It was usual, and indeed necessary, formerly to
_sew_ letters, when they were written upon parchment; but the practice
continued long after the invention of paper.' _plyte_, to fold it up.

1229. 'A cushion, beaten with gold;' cf. Kn. Ta. A 979.

1238. A proverb: 'slight impressions soon fade.'

1249. Tyrwhitt, s. v. _somme_, boggles over this line, but it is quite
right. Bell takes occasion to speak of the 'rugged lines' to be found in
this poem; which is true enough of his own peculiar text. In Beowulf, l.
207, we have _fift[=e]na sum_, one of fifteen, where the cardinal number is
used; and this is the usual idiom. But the ordinal number is used also. In
St. Juliana, p. 79, we read that 'te sea sencte him on his _thrituthe
sum_,' the sea drowned him and 'thirtieth some' of his men, which I
understand to mean 'and twenty-nine of his men,' the master being the
thirtieth; but Mr. Cockayne and Mr. Bradley make it mean 'him and thirty
others.' So again, in Sir Tristrem, 817, we have: 'He busked and made him
yare hi[s] _fiftend som_ of knight,' he made ready for himself his
'fifteenth some' of knights, which I should explain to mean a band of
fifteen knights, _himself included_, or, himself being the fifteenth.
_Some_ in such phrases has a collective force. However, the examples in
Bosworth and Toller's A. S. Dict., s. v. _sum_, shew that this mode of
expression is also sometimes used _exclusively_ of the leader.

1274. _on to pyke_, for her to pick upon, or pick at; i. e. for her to pull
out; see l. 1273. See examples in Halliwell, s. v. _pike_, of 'to _pyke
out_ thornes,' to pick out thorns.

1276. Cf. 'to strike while the iron is hot;' see Melibeus, B 2226.

1289. 'But therein he had much to heave at and to do.'

1291. 'And why? for fear of shame.' Cm. has _for speche_, i. e. for fear of
talk or scandal.

1315. _accesse_, attack, as of fever. See New E. Dict.

1343. _refreyde_, grow cool; cf. Balade to Rosemounde, l. 21.

1349. _after his gestes_, according to his deeds, or adventures.

1390. _forbyse_, to give (thee) instances. Hardly a correct form; it should
rather be _forbysne_, short for _forbysnen_, as the verb is formed from the
sb. _forbysne_, A. S. _foreb[=y]sen_, an example, instance. The word was
obsolescent.

1398. _Deiphebus_ (= _Dé'ph[)e]bús)_ is always trisyllabic.

1410. He means that he would do more for him than for any one, 'except for
him whom he loves most,' i. e. Troilus.

1427. 'With spur and whip,' i. e. with all expedition.

1495. _word and ende_, beginning and end; cf. iii. 702, v. 1669. The right
phrase is _ord and ende_, where _ord_ is 'beginning;' but it would seem
that, by Chaucer's time, _word_ had been corruptly substituted for the
obsolescent _ord_. See Monk. Ta. B 3911, and the note.

1534. _triste_, station for a huntsman to shoot from. See _Tristre_ in
Stratmann.

1554. _renne_, to run, like an excited madman.

1564. 'Bon fait prolixite foïr;' Rom. de la Rose, 18498.

1581. 'Although it does not please her to recommend (a remedy).'

1594. _To mowen_, to have it in her power; A. S. _mugan_.

1650. _for my bettre arm_, not even to save my right arm.

1661. _him thar nought_, 'him needeth not,' he need not do.

1735. An obscure allusion. 'Perhaps it means, in regard for the king and
queen, his parents;' Bell. My own guess is different. I think it quite
possible that Chaucer is referring to the two 'crowns' or garlands, one of
roses and one of lilies, about which so much is said in his early work
entitled the _Lyf of Seint Cecile_, afterwards called the Second Nonnes
Tale (see G 270). Thus Pandarus, with his usual impudence, conjures
Criseyde to pity Troilus by two solemn adjurations, viz. for the sake of
Him who gave us all our souls, and by the virtue of the two heavenly crowns
which an angel once brought _to a chaste couple_. He thus boldly insinuates
that the proposed meeting is of the most innocent character. This I take to
be the whole point of the allusion.

1737. 'Fie on the devil!' I. e. despise detraction.

1738. _com of_, come off; we _now_ say 'come on!' See ll. 1742, 1750.

1751. 'But now (I appeal) to you.'

1752. _cankedort_, a state of suspense, uncertainty, or anxiety; as appears
from the context. The word occurs nowhere else. Only one MS. (H2) has the
spelling _kankerdort_, usually adopted in modern editions; Thynne has
_cankedorte_, but it needs no final _e_. The etymology is unknown nor do we
even know how to divide it. There is a verb _kanka_, to shake, be unsteady,
&c., in Swedish dialects (Rietz), and the Swed. _ort_ is a place, quarter;
if there is any relationship, _kanked-ort_ might mean 'shaky place,' or
ticklish position. Another theory is that _canker_ relates to _canker_, a
cancer, disease, and that _dort_ is related to Lowl. Sc. _dort_, sulkiness.
But this is assuming that the right spelling is _canker-dort_, a theory
which the MSS. do not favour. Neither does the sense of 'ill-humour' seem
very suitable. As I am bound, in this difficult case, to suggest what I
can, I must add that it is also possible to suppose that _cankedort_ is of
French origin, answering to an O. F. _quant que dort_, lit. 'whenever he is
asleep (?),' or 'although he is asleep(?);' and hence (conceivably) meaning
'in a sleepy state.' The phrase _quant que_, also spelt _kan ke_ (and in
many other ways) is illustrated by a column of examples in Godefroy's
Dictionary; but its usual sense is 'as well as,' or 'whatever'; thus _kan
ke poet_ = as well as he can. Or can we make it = _com ki dort_, like one
who sleeps?


BOOK III.

The following scheme gives a general idea of the relationship of this Book
to the original.

  CHAUCER: BOOK III.      FILOSTRATO: BOOK III.
  ll. 1-38.               st. 74-79.
  239-287.                5-10.
  344-441.                11-20.
  813-833.                [Boethius, II. Pr. 4. 86-120.]
  1310-1426.              31-43.
  1443-1451.              44.
  1471-1492.              44-48.
  1513-1555.              50-56.
  1588-1624.              56-60.

  1695-1743.              70-73.
  1744-1768.              [Boethius, II. Met. 8.]
  1772-1806.              90-93.
  1807-1813.              Bk. I, st. 3. 1.

1-38. This is an exceptionally difficult passage, and some of the editions
make great nonsense of it, especially of ll. 15-21. It is, however,
imitated from stanzas 74-79 of the Filostrato, Book III; where the
invocation is put into the mouth of Troilus.

The key to it is that it is an address to _Venus_, both the planet and the
goddess.

2. The planet Venus was considered to be in 'the _third_ heaven.' The
'heavens' or spheres were named, respectively, after the Moon, Mercury,
Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the 'fixed stars;' beyond which was
the Primum Mobile, the earth being in the centre of all, and immoveable.
Sometimes the spheres of the seven planets were reckoned backwards from
Saturn, Venus being then in the _fifth_ heaven; see Lenvoy a Scogan, 9, and
the note.

3. 'O favourite of the Sun, O dear daughter of Jove!' Venus was considered
a fortunate planet. Perhaps it is best to quote the Italian text here:--

 'O luce eterna, il cui lieto splendore                                 585
  Fa bello il terzo ciel, dal qual ne piove
  Piacer, vaghezza, pietade ed amore;
  Del sole amica, e figliuola di Giove,
  Benigna donna d'ogni gentil core,
  Certa cagion del valor che mi muove                                   590
  A' sospir dolci della mia salute,
  Sempre lodata sia la tua virtute.

  Il ciel, la terra, lo mare e l'inferno
  Ciascuno in sè la tua potenzia sente,
  O chiara luce; e s'io il ver discerno,                                595
  Le piante, i semi, e l'erbe puramente,
  Gli uccei, le fiere, i pesci con eterno
  Vapor ti senton nel tempo piacente,
  E gli uomini e gli dei, nè creatura
  Senza di te nel mondo vale o dura.                                    600

  Tu Giove prima agli alti affetti lieto,
  Pe' qua' vivono e son tutte le cose,
  Movesti, o bella dea; e mansueto
  Sovente il rendi all' opere noiose
  Di noi mortali; e il meritato fleto                                   605
  In liete feste volgi e dilettose;
  E in mille forme già quaggiù il mandasti,
  Quand' ora d'una ed or d'altra il pregasti.

11. _vapour_, influence; Ital. _Vapor_ (l. 598).

15. The readings in this stanza are settled by the Ital. text. Thus, in ll.
17, 19, 20, read _him_, not _hem_. _Comeveden_, didst move or instigate;
agreeing with _ye_, for which Mod. E. uses _thou_. 'Thou didst first
instigate Jove to those glad effects (influences), through which all things
live and exist; and didst make him amorous of mortal things; and, at thy
pleasure, didst ever give him, in love, success or trouble; and, in a
thousand forms, didst send him down to (gain) love on earth; and he caught
those whom it pleased you (he should catch).'

In l. 17 we find _Comeveden_ sometimes turned into _Comenden_, or even
_Commodious_! The Italian text has _Movesti_ (l. 603).

22. Venus was supposed to appease the angry planet Mars; see Compl. of
Mars, 36-42.

27. 'According as a man wishes.'

29. 'Tu in unità le case e li cittadi, Li regni, ... Tien.'

31-34.

 'Tu sola le nascosi qualitadi
  Delle cose conosci, onde 'l costrutto
  Vi metti tal, che fai maravigliare
  Chi tua potenza non sa riguardare.'

I. e. 'Thou only knowest the hidden qualities of things, whence thou
formest such a construction, that thou makest to marvel any one who knows
not how to estimate thy power.' Chaucer seems to have used _construe_
because suggested by _costrutto_, but he really uses it as answering to
_sa_ (in the fourth line), and omits the words _'l costrutto vi metti tal_
altogether. Hence ll. 33-35 mean: 'when they cannot explain how it may come
to pass that _she_ loves _him_, or why _he_ loves _her_; (so as to shew)
why _this_ fish, and not _that_ one, comes to the weir.'

_Io_ (= _jo_), come to pass. This word is not in the dictionaries, and has
been coolly altered into _go_ (!) in various editions. But it answers to O.
F. _joer_ (F. _jouer_), to play, hence, to play a game, to make a move (as
in a game); here, to come about, come to pass.

35. _were_, weir, pool where fish are caught; see Parl. Foules, 138, and
note.

36. 'You have imposed a law on folks in this universe;' Ital. 'Tu legge, o
dea, poni all' universo.'

44, 45. _Inhelde_, pour in. _Caliope_, Calliope, muse of epic poetry;
similarly invoked by Dante, Purg. i. 9.

87. 'Though he was not pert, nor made difficulties; nor was he too bold,
(as if about) to sing a mass for a fool.' The last expression was probably
proverbial; it seems to mean to speak without hesitation or a feeling of
respect.

115. _to watre wolde_, would turn to water; cf. Squi. Ta. F 496.

120. '_I? what?_' i. e. 'I? what (am I to do)?' In l. 122, Pandarus repeats
her words, mockingly: 'You say I? what? why, of course you should pity
him.'

136-138. 'And I (am) to have comfort, as it pleases you, (being at the same
time) under your correction, (so as to have what is) equal to my offence,
as (for instance) death.' See Cant. Ta. B 1287.

150. 'By the feast of Jupiter, who presides over nativities.' The reason
for the use of _natal_ is not obvious. Cf. 'Scit Genius, natale comes qui
temperat astrum;' Horat. Ep. ii. 2. 187.

188. 'I seem to hear the town-bells ringing for this miracle, though no
hand pulls the ropes.'

193, 194. _and oon, And two_, 'both the one of you and the other.'

198. _bere the belle_, take the former place, take precedence; like the
bell-wether that heads the flock. See the New E. Dict.

228. 'Straight as a line,' i. e. directly, at once.

294. See Manc. Ta. H 333, and note.

299. 'Thou understandest and knowest enough proverbs against the vice of
gossiping, even if men spoke truth as often as they lie.'

308. 'No boaster is to be believed, in the natural course of things.'

328, 329. _drat_, dreadeth. Cf. 'Felix, quem faciunt aliena pericula
cautum.' But Chaucer took it from Le Rom. de la Rose, 8041-2: 'Moult a
benéurée vie Cil qui par autrui se chastie.'

340. 'And a day is appointed for making up the charters' (which will
particularise what she has granted you); metaphorical.

349. _richesse_, abundance; not a happy word, but suggested by the Ital.
text: 'I sospir ch'egli aveva a gran dovizia;' Fil. iii. 11. _Dovizia_
(Lat. _diuitiae_) is precisely 'richesse.' Bell has _rehetyng_, i. e.
comforting (from O. F. _rehaiter_, _reheiter_), which gives no sense; and
explains it by '_reheating_!'

354. _lusty_, lusty person; cf. Cant. Ta. A 165, 208.

377. 'Or durst (do so), or should know (how).'

380. _stokked_, fastened in the stocks; cf. Acts xvi. 24.

404. _Departe it so_, make this distinction.

410. _frape_, company, troop. Marked by Tyrwhitt as not understood. Other
examples occur. 'With hem a god gret _frape_;' Adam Davy, &c., ed.
Furnivall, p. 60, col. 1, text 3, l. 390; and see Allit. Morte Arthure, ed.
Brock, 2163, 2804, 3548. Godefroy gives O. F. _frap_, a multitude, and
_frapaille_, rabble.

445. 'And wished to be seised of that which he lacked.'

497. 'Or to enumerate all the looks and words of one that is in such
uncertainty.'

502. _as seith_; but it does not appear that Boccaccio says anything of the
kind. The same remark applies to l. 575.

510. _Fulfelle_ is a Kentish form, the _e_ answering to A. S. _y_. Similar
forms occur in Gower. See note to Book Duch. 438.

526. Scan: Dréd | elées | it cleer,' &c. The sense is: 'it was clear, in
the direction of the wind, from every magpie and every spoil-sport.' I. e.
no one could detect them; they kept (like hunters) well to leeward, and
there were no magpies or telltale birds to windward, to give an alarm.

529. Scan: In this matér-e, both-e frem'd. _fremed_, strange, wild.

542. _holy_, i. e. sacred to Apollo. From Ovid, Met. i. 566: 'laurea ..
uisa est agitasse cacumen.'

545. 'And therefore let no one hinder him.'

572. The readings all shew various corruptions of _thurfte_, which none of
the scribes understood; see _thurfen_, _tharf_, in Stratmann. This is not
the only place where _thurfte_ has been ousted from the text. Cf. _thar_
(for _tharf_) in the Reves Ta. A 4320, &c. _Yow thurfte have_, you would
need (to) have. _Yow_ is the dat. case, governed by the impers. verb. The
reading _yow durste_ turns _yow_ (an accusative) into an imaginary
nominative; but the nom. form is _ye_, which the scribes did not venture to
substitute.

584. _goosish_, goose-like, silly. This delicious epithet was turned into
_gofysshe_ by Thynne, and modern editions perpetuate the blunder. Tyrwhitt
derived _gofish_ from F. _goffe_, a word which is much later than Chaucer,
and was probably merely adapted from Ital. _goffo_, stupid. The Century
Dict. goes a step further, inserting a second _f_, and producing a form
_goffish_, against all authority. Cf. Parl. Foules, 568, 586.

601. _stewe_, small chamber, closet; cf. G. _Stube_.

602. 'Where he was shut in, as in a coop.'

609. 'There was no dainty to be fetched'; they were all there.

614. _Wade_; this is the hero mentioned in the Merch. Tale, E 1424; see
note.

617-620. Cf. Boethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 60-68.

622. 'Without her leave, at the will of the gods.'

624. _bente_, i. e. curved, crescent; see l. 549. Cf. Boeth. Bk. I. Met. 5.
6, 7.

625. The Moon, Saturn, and Jupiter were all in conjunction in Cancer, which
was the mansion of the moon. We are to understand that this caused the
great rain.

640. _ron_, rained; so also in l. 677. The usual pt. t. is _reinede_, but
we also find _roon_, _ron_, as in P. Plowm. B. xiv. 66 (C. xvi. 270), and
in Trevisa, tr. of Higden, ii. 239. The pt. t. of A. S. _rignan_,
_r[=i]nan_, is usually _r[=i]nde_; but the strong pt. _r[=a]n_ occurs in
the Blickling Glosses.

648. _a game_, in game; _a_ = _an_, _on_; Cm. has _on_.

671. _The wyn anon_, the wine (shall come) at once; alluding to the wine
drunk just before going to bed. See Prol. A 819, 820.

674. 'The _voidè_ being drunk, and the cross-curtain drawn immediately
afterwards.' The best reading is _voyde_ or _voydee_. This seems to be here
used as a name for the 'loving-cup' or 'grace-cup,' which was drunk after
the table had been cleared or _voided_. Properly, it was a slight dessert
of 'spices' and wine; where _spices_ meant sweetmeats, dried fruits, &c.
See Notes and Queries, 2 S. xi. 508. The _traverse_ was a screen or curtain
drawn across the room; cf. Cant. Ta. E 1817; King's Quair, st. 90. See
Additional Note, p. 506.

690. This refers to the attendants. They were no longer allowed to skip
about (run on errands) or to tramp about noisily, but were packed off to
bed, with a malediction on those who stirred about. _Traunceth_, tramps
about, is used of a bull by Gower, C. A. ii. 72. In Beaumont and Fletcher,
Fair Maid of the Inn, v. 2, we find--'but, _traunce_ the world over, you
shall never,' &c. For _traunce_, Thynne reads _praunce_, which has a
similar sense. Morris explains _traunce_ here as a sb., which seems
impossible.

695. _The olde daunce_, the old game; see Prol. A 476.

696. _sey_, saw; perhaps read _seye_, subj., might perceive. If so, read
_al_, i. e. every.

702. 'Beginning and end;' see note to bk. II. 1495.

711. I. e. or else upset everything; cf. the phrase, 'all the fat is in the
fire.'

716. Mars and Saturn both had an evil influence.

717. _combust_, quenched, viz. by being too near the sun; see Astrolabe,
pt. ii. § 4. Venus and Mercury, when thus 'combust,' lost their influence.
_let_, hindered.

721. _Adoon_, Adonis; see Ovid, Met. x. 715.

722. _Europe_, Europa; see Leg. of Good Women, 113, and note.

725. _Cipris_, Venus; see Ho. Fame, 518.

726. _Dane_, Daphne; see Kn. Ta. A 2062.

729. _Mercúrie_, Mercury; _Herse_, daughter of Cecrops, beloved by Mercury.
Her sister, Aglauros, had displeased Minerva (_Pallas_); whereupon Minerva
made Aglauros envious of Herse. Mercury turned Aglauros into stone because
she hindered his suit. See Ovid, Met. ii. 708-832.

733. 'Fatal sisters;' i.e. the Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. 'Which
spun my destiny, before any cloth (infant's covering) was made for me.' See
Kn. Ta. A 1566; Leg. G. Wom. 2629.

764. Let sleeping dogs lie; a proverb.

773. 'To hold in hand' is to feed with false hopes, to delude by pretended
love.

775. Lit. 'and make him a hood above a cap.' A _calle_ (caul) was a
close-fitting cap, a skull-cap. To put on a hood over this evidently means
to cover up the eyes, to cajole, to hoodwink.

791, 797. _shal_, owe to. _sholde love_, i.e. are reported to love.

813-836. Founded on Boethius, lib. II. Pr. 4. 'Quàm multis amaritudinibus
humanae felicitatis dulcedo respersa est!... Anxia enim res est humanorum
conditio bonorum, et quae uel numquam tota proueniat, uel numquam perpetua
subsistat.... Ad haec, quem caduca ista felicitas uehit, uel scit eam, uel
nescit esse mutabilem. Si nescit, quaenam beata sors esse potest
ignorantiae caecitate? Si scit, metuat necesse est, ne amittat, quod amitti
potest non dubitat; quare continuus timor non sinit esse felicem.... quonam
modo praesens uita facere beatos potest?' See the E. version, ll. 86, 56,
109.

839. 'Why hast thou made Troilus distrust me?'

853, 854. 'Danger is drawn nearer by delay.' We say, 'Delays are
dangerous.' Cf. Havelok, l. 1352. _abodes_, abidings, tarryings.

855. _Néc'_, with elided _e_, forms the first foot. 'Every thing has its
time;' cf. Eccl. iii. 1.

861. _farewel feldefare_, (and people will say) farewell, fieldfare! Cf.
Rom. Rose, 5510. In the Rom. Rose, it refers to false friends, who, when
fortune frowns, say 'Go! farewell fieldfare,' i.e. Begone, we have done
with you. As fieldfares come here in the winter months, people are glad to
see them go, as a sign of approaching summer. In the present case, the
sense appears to be that, when an opportunity is missed, the harm is done;
and people will cry, 'farewell, fieldfare!' by way of derision. We might
paraphrase the line by saying: 'the harm is done, and nobody cares.'

885. _blewe_, blue; the colour of _constancy_.

890. 'Hazle-bushes shake.' This is a truism known to every one, and no news
at all; in like manner, your ring will tell him nothing, and is useless.

901. _feffe him_, enfeoff him, bestow on him. _whyte_, fair.

919. _at pryme face_, at the first glance; _primâ facie_.

931. _At dulcarnon_, at a non-plus, in extreme perplexity. _Dulcarnon_, as
pointed out by Selden, in his Pref. to Drayton's Polyolbion, represents the
Pers. and Arab. _d[=u]'lkarnayn_, lit. two-horned; from Pers. _d[=u]_, two,
and _karn_, horn. It was a common medieval epithet of Alexander the Great,
who was so called because he claimed descent from Jupiter Ammon, whose
image was provided with horns like a ram. Speght rightly says that
_Dulcarnon_ was also a name for the 47th prop. of Euclid, Book I, but gives
a false reason and etymology. The real reason is plain enough, viz. that
the two smaller squares in the diagram stick up like two horns. And, as
this proposition is somewhat difficult for beginners, it here takes the
sense of 'puzzle;' hence Criseyde was _at Dulcarnon_, because she was in
perplexity. Speght refers to Alex. Neckam, De Naturis Rerum; see Wright's
edition, p. 295.

But this is not all. In l. 933, Pandarus explains that Dulcarnon is called
'fleming of wrecches.' There is a slight error here: 'fleming of wrecches,'
i.e. banishment of the miserable, is a translation of _Fuga miserorum_,
which is written opposite this line in MS. Harl. 1239; and further, _Fuga
miserorum_ is a sort of Latin translation of _Eleëfuga_ or _Eleufuga_, from
[Greek: eleos] pity, and [Greek: phygê], flight. The error lies in
confusing _Dulcarnon_, the 47th proposition, with _Eleufuga_, a name for
the 5th proposition; a confusion due to the fact that both propositions
were considered difficult. Roger Bacon, Opus Tertium, cap. 6, says: 'Quinta
propositio geometricae Euclidis dicitur _Elefuga_, id est, _fuga
miserorum_.' Ducange, s. v. _Eleufuga_, quotes from Alanus, Anticlaudiani
lib. iii. cap. 6--'Huius tirones curantis [_read_ cur artis] _Eleufuga_
terret,' &c. The word also occurs in Richard of Bury's Philobiblon, cap.
xiii, somewhat oddly translated by J.B. Inglis in 1832. 'How many scholars
has the Helleflight of Euclid repelled!'

This explanation, partly due to the Rev. W.G. Clark (joint-editor of the
Globe Shakespeare), was first given in the _Athenæum_, Sept. 23, 1871, p.
393, in an article written by myself.

934. _It_, i.e. _Dulcarnon_, or Euclid's proposition. 'It seems hard,
because the wretched pupils will not learn it, owing to their very sloth or
other wilful defects.'

936. _This_ = _this is_; as elsewhere. _fecches_, vetches.

947. Understand _be_; 'where (I hope) good thrift may be.' Cf. 966.

978. _fere_, fire; as in Bk. i. 229. Usually _fyre_.

979. _fond his contenaunce_, lit. found his demeanour, i.e. composed
himself as if to read.

1010. _wivere_, viper; O. F. _wivre_ (F. _givre_), from Lat. _uipera_. The
heraldic _wiver_ or _wyvern_ became a wondrous winged dragon, with two
legs; wholly unlike the original viper. See Thynne's Animadversions, &c.,
ed. Furnivall, p. 41.

1013. 'Alas! that he, either entirely, or a slice of him.'

1021. 'That sufferest undeserved jealousy (to exist).'

1029. _after that_, accordingly; _his_, its.

1035. See note to Bk. ii. 784.

1046. _ordal_, ordeal, trial by ordeal, i.e. by fire or water. See Thynne's
Animadversions, ed. Furnivall, p. 66.

1056. _wreigh_, covered; A. S. _wr[=a]h_; see _wr[=i]hen_ in Stratmann.

1064. _shoures_, assaults. Bell actually substitutes _stouris_, as being
'clearly the true reading.' But editors have no right to reject real words
which they fail to understand. _Shour_ sometimes means a shower of arrows
or darts, an assault, &c.; cf. A.S. _hildesc[=u]r_, a flight of missiles.
In fact, it recurs in this sense in Bk. iv. 47, where Bell again turns it
into _stoure_, against authority.

1067. 'For it seemed to him not like (mere) strokes with a rod ... but he
felt the very cramp of death.'

1106. _al forgeve_, all is forgiven. _stint_, stopped.

1154. _bar him on honde_, assured him.

1177. 'For a crime, there is mercy (to be had).'

1194. _sucre be or soot_, may be like sugar or like soot, i.e. pleasant or
the reverse. We must read _soot_ (not _sote_, sweet, as in Bell) because it
rimes with _moot_. Moreover, soot was once proverbially bitter. 'Bittrore
then the sote' occurs in Altenglische Dichtungen, ed. Boddeker, p. 121; and
in Rutebuef's Vie Sainte Marie l'Egiptianne, ed. Jubinal, 280, we find
'plus amer que suie;' cf. Rom. Rose, 10670: 'amer Plus que n'est suie.'

1215. Cf. 'Bitter pills may have sweet effects;' Hazlitt's Proverbs.

1231. _Bitrent_, for _bitrendeth_, winds round; cf. iv. 870. _wryth_, for
_wrytheth_, writhes.

1235. 'When she hears any shepherd speak.'

1249. 'And often invoked good luck upon her snowy throat.'

1257. _welwilly_, full of good will, propitious.

1258. _Imeneus_, Hymenæus, Hymen; cf. Ovid, Her. xiv. 27.

1261-4. Imitated from Dante, Parad. xxxiii. 14:--

 'Che qual vuol grazie, e a te non ricorre,
  Sua disianza vuol volar senz' ali.
  La tua benignità non pur soccorre,' &c.

1282. 'Mercy prevails over (lit. surpasses) justice.'

1344. 'Or else do I dream it?'

1357. _sooth_, for _sooth is_, i.e. it is true.

1369. Bell takes _scripture_ to mean the mottos or posies on the rings.
Perhaps this is right.

1374. _holt_, holds; 'that holds it in despite.'

1375. 'Of the money, that he can heap up and lay hold of.' For _mokren_,
cf. Chaucer's Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 5. 11. _Pens_, pence, is a translation
of Ital. _denari_, money, in the Filostrato, Book iii. st. 38.

1384. _the whyte_, silver coins; _the rede_, gold coins.

1389. _Myda_, Midas; see Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 951.

1391. _Crassus_; wantonly altered to _Cresus_ in Bell's edition, on the
ground that the story is told of Croesus. But Chaucer knew better. M.
Crassus, surnamed Dives (the Rich), was slain in battle against the
Parthians, B. C. 53. Orodes, king of Parthia, caused molten gold to be
poured into the mouth of his dead enemy, saying, 'Sate thyself now with
that metal of which, in life, thou wast so greedy;' Cicero, Att. vi. 1. 14;
Florus, iii. 11. 4.

1407. 'And to counterbalance with joy their former woe'.

1415. The cock is called a common astrologer (i. e. astronomer), because he
announces to all the time of day; cf. Non. Pr. Ta. B 4043; Parl. Foules,
350. Translated from 'vulgaris astrologus;' Alanus.

1417, 9. _Lucifer_, the morning-star, the planet Venus. _Fortuna maior_,
the planet Jupiter. Mars and Saturn were supposed to have an _evil_
influence; the Sun, Mercury, and Moon, had no great influence either way;
whilst Jupiter and Venus had a _good_ influence, and were therefore called,
respectively, _Fortuna maior_ and _Fortuna minor_. See G. Douglas, ed.
Small, ii. 288. The MSS. have _that anoon_, (it happened) that anon; but
this requires us to suppose so awkward an ellipsis that it is better to
read _than_, answering to _whan_.

1428. _Almena_, Alcmena; a note in MS. H. has: 'Almena mater Herculis.'
Alcmena was the mother of Hercules by Jupiter. Jupiter lengthened the night
beyond its usual limit. Plautus has a play on the subject, called
_Amphitruo_, as Jupiter personated Amphitryon.

1437-9. _ther_, wherefore; 'wherefore (I pray that) God, creator of nature,
may bind thee so fast to our hemisphere,' &c. A similar construction occurs
in l. 1456.

1453. _bore_, aperture, chink; 'for every chink lets in one of thy bright
rays.' See New E. Dict.

1462. Engravers of small seals require a good light.

1464. _Tytan_, Titan, frequently used as synonymous with the sun; as in
Ovid, Met. i. 10. Chaucer has confused him with _Tithonus_, the husband of
Aurora, whom he denotes by _dawing_ in l. 1466, and by _morwe_ in l. 1469.

 'Iamque, fugatura Tithoni coniuge noctem,
    Praeuius Aurorae Lucifer ortus erat.'
                             Ovid, Heroid. xviii. 111.

1490. Read _wer-e_, in two syllables. _these worldes tweyne_ seems to mean
'two worlds such as this.'

1495. This somewhat resembles Verg. Ecl. i. 60-4.

1502. 'Even if I had to die by torture;' as in Bk. i. 674.

1514. _mo_, others; see note to Cler. Ta. E 1039.

1546. 'Desire burnt him afresh, and pleasure began to arise more than at
first.' Cf. the parallel line in Leg. Good Wom. 1156: 'Of which ther gan to
breden swich a fyr.' Yet Bell rejects this reading as being 'not at all in
Chaucer's manner,' and prefers nonsense.

1577. 'Christ forgave those who crucified him.'

1600. Cf. Æneid. vi. 550:--

 'Quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis
  Tartareus Phlegethon.'

1625. From Boethius, lib. ii. Pr. 4: 'Sed hoc est, quod recolentem
uehementius coquit. Nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus
est infortunii, fuisse felicem.' Cf. Dante, Inf. v. 121; Tennyson, Locksley
Hall--'That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.'

1634. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 8301-4; from Ovid, Art. Amat. ii. 13.

1642. _Ne I_, read _N'I_. _rakle_, behave rashly; it is plainly a _verb_,
formed from the adj. _rakel_. Morris inserts _ben_ after _rakel_, to the
ruin of the scansion. Cf. Norweg. _rakla_, to ramble, totter, be unsteady
(Aasen); Swed. dial. _rakkla_, to rove (Rietz); Icel. _reka_, to drive.

1649. _I shal_, I owe; A. S. _ic sceal_.

1687. _comprende_, comprehend; F. _comprendre_. This is clearly the right
form. In the Sq. Ta. F 223, though the MSS. have _comprehende_, it is
obvious that _comprende_ is the real reading.

1703. _Pirous_, i. e. Pyroeis, one of the four horses that drew the chariot
of the sun. The other three were Eöus, Æthon, and Phlegon; see Ovid, Met.
ii. 153.

1705. 'Have taken some short cut, to spite me.'

1732. 'To the extent of a single knot.' It would not be necessary to
explain this, if it were not for Bell's explanation of _knot_ as 'gnat.'

1734. _y-masked_, enmeshed; cf. A. S. _masc_, a mesh.

1744-68. Paraphrased from Boethius, lib. ii. Met. 8; but note that the
lines italicised are transposed, and represent ll. 1744-1750:

 'Quòd mundus stabili fide Concordes uariat uices,
  Quòd pugnantia semina Foedus perpetuum tenent,
  Quòd Phoebus roseum diem Curru prouehit aureo,
  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus Phoebe noctibus imperet,
  Ut fluctus auidum mare Certo fine coërceat,
  Ne terris liceat uagis Latos tendere terminos.
  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat, Terras ac pelagus regens,
  Et caelo imperitans Amor._ Hic si fraena remiserit,
  Quidquid nunc amat inuicem, Bellum continuò geret:
  Et quam nunc socia fide Pulcris motibus incitant,
  Certent soluere machinam. Hic sancto populos quoque
  Iunctos foedere continet: Hic et coniugii sacrum
  Castis nectit amoribus: Hic fidis etiam sua
  Dictat iura sodalibus. O felix hominum genus,
  Si uestros animos Amor Quo caelum regitur, regat!'

1764. _halt to-hepe_, holds together, preserves in concord. Bell and Morris
have the corrupt reading _to kepe_. _To hepe_, to a heap, became the adv.
_to-hepe_, together. It occurs again in Ch. Astrolabe, Part I. § 14, and in
Boethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 182. Cf. 'gaderen tresor _to-hepe_,' Polit. Songs,
ed. Wright, p. 325; 'han brought it _to-hepe_,' P. Ploughman's Crede, l.
727.

1766. 'That Love, by means of his power, would be pleased,' &c.

1779. _In tyme of trewe_, in time of truce; as in Boccaccio, Fil. iii. st.
91. Bell wrongly has _Out of Troy_. Morris alters _trewe_ to _trewes_; but
see Bk. iv. l. 1312.

1805. These are four of the seven deadly sins; see Pers. Tale.

1807. _lady_, i. e. Venus, called _Dionaea_ as being daughter of Dione;
Æneid. iii. 19. Cf. Homer, Il. v. 370.

1809. The nine Muses. Helicon was a long way from Mount Parnassus; but see
notes to Anelida, 15, and Ho. Fame, 521.

1817. 'As it pleases my author to relate.'


BOOK IV.

The following scheme gives some notion of the relationship of the contents
of this book to the Filostrato, but Chaucer constantly expands and adds to
the original, and not unfrequently transposes the order of the text.

1. In the Proem, ll. 1-3 correspond to Fil. iii. st. 94, ll. 1-3; and ll. 8
and 10 to the same stanza, ll. 4 and 7. The rest is original.

3. Cf. Boethius, lib. ii. Pr. 1: 'Intelligo ... illius [Fortunae] ... cum
his, quos eludere nititur, blandissimam familiaritatem.'

5. _hent and blent_, for _hendeth and blendeth_, catches and blinds.

6, 7. Cf. Boethius, lib. ii. Met. 2: 'Ultroque gemitus, dura quos fecit
[Fortuna], ridet.' Whence, in Le Roman de la Rose, 8076-9, the passage
which Chaucer here imitates; _the mowe_ = F. _la moe_.

22. _Herines_ i. e. Furies; used as the pl. of _Erynis_ or _Erinnys_; see
note to Compl. to Pite, 92. Their names (see l. 24) were Megaera, Alecto,
and Tisiphone. Bell's remark, that Chaucer found these names in Boccaccio,
does not seem to be founded on fact. He more likely found them in Vergil,
who has _Erinnys_, Æn. ii. 336, 573; vii. 447, 570; _Alecto_, id. vii. 324,
341, 405, 415, 445, 476; _Megæra_, id. xii. 846; _Tisiphone_, vi. 571, x.
761. But I suppose that, even in Chaucer's time, MS. note-books existed,
containing such information as the names of the Furies. Chaucer even knew
that some (as Æschylus) considered them to be the daughters of Night.

25. _Quiryne_, Quirinus. Ovid, Fasti, ii. 476, tells us that Quirinus was
Romulus; and just above, ii. 419, that Romulus and Remus were sons of Mars.

29. _Ligginge ... The Grekes_, while the Greeks lay.

32. _Hercules Lyoun_, Hercules' lion, the lion of Hercules; alluding to the
lion's skin which Hercules wore. Valerius Flaccus, Argonauticon, lib. i.
263, has 'Herculeo ... leoni;' and Chaucer seems to have read this author,
or at any rate his first book; see Leg. of Good Women, l. 1457, and the
note. However, Chaucer shews his knowledge of the story clearly enough in
his tr. of Boethius, Bk. iv. Met. 7. The reference is, simply, to the sign
Leo. The sun was in this sign during the latter part of July and the former
part of August; but we are further told that he was in the 'breast' of Leo,
and therefore near the very bright star Regulus, called in Arabic
_Kalbalased_, or the Lion's Heart, which was situated almost on the zodiac,
and (at that time) near the 20th degree of the sign. This gives the date as
being the first week in August.

41. _in the berd_, in the beard, i. e. face to face.

47. _shour_, assault, attack; see note to Bk. iii. 1064.

50-4. From Boccaccio. The right names are Antenor, Polydamas, Menestheus or
Mnestheus, Xanthippus, Sarpedon, Polymnestor, Polites, Riphaeus, all
mentioned by Boccaccio, who probably took them from Guido delle Colonne.
But Boccaccio omits 'Phebuseo,' and I do not know who is meant. Several of
these names may be found in the allit. Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and
Donaldson; as Antenor and his son Polydamas, at ll. 3947, 3954; Xanthippus,
king of Phrygia, l. 6107; Sarpedon, prince of Lycia, l. 5448; and in
Lydgate's Siege of Troy, Bk. ii. capp. 16, 20. Polymestor, or Polymnestor,
was king of the Thracian Chersonese, and an ally of the Trojans. Polites
was a son of Priam (Æneid. ii. 526). Mnestheus is repeatedly mentioned in
Vergil (Æn. v. 116, &c.), and is also called Menestheus (id. x. 129); he is
a different person from Menestheus, king of Athens, who fought on the other
side. For Riphaeus, see Verg. Aen. ii. 339. The Ital. forms are Antenorre,
Polidamas, Monesteo, Santippo, Serpedon, Polinestorre, Polite, Rifeo.
Observe that Monostéo, Riphéo, Phebuséo rime together, with an accent on
the penultimate.

62. _thassege_, for _the assege_, the siege; Barbour has _assege_, siege,
in his Bruce, xvii. 270, xx. 8; pl. _assegis_, xx. 12. MS. H. wrongly has
_thessage_. See l. 1480 below.

64. _Calkas_, Calchas; see Bk. i. 66, 71.

79. _This town to shende_, i. e. (it will be best for you) to despoil this
town.

86. _resport_, regard. This strange word is certified by its reappearance
in l. 850, where it rimes to _discomfórt_. It is given in Roquefort, but
only in a technical sense. It was, doubtless, formed from O. F. _esport_,
deportment, demeanour, regard (Godefroy), by prefixing _re-_; and means
'demeanour towards,' or (here) simply 'regard,' as also in l. 850. The
etymology is from Lat. _re-_, _ex_, and _portare_. Cf. F. _rapport_, from
_re-_, _ad_, and _portare_.

96. _in hir sherte_, in her smock only; i.e. without much rich clothing;
'as she was.'

99. 'For because I saw no opportunity.'

112. _as yerne_, as briskly as possible, very soon; so in l. 201.

120-4. Laomedon, father of Priam, founded Troy. Apollo and Poseidon
(Neptune) had been condemned for a while to serve him for wages. But
Laomedon refused them payment, and incurred their displeasure.

133. Antenor had been taken prisoner by the Greeks; see Lydgate, Siege of
Troye, Bk. iii. ch. 24. Lydgate's version is that Antenor was to be
exchanged for Thoas, king of Calydon; and, at the request of Chalcas, it
was arranged that Antenor should be exchanged for both Thoas and Criseyde
(see l. 138); to which Priam consented.

_withoute more_, without further ado; cf. l. 376.

143. _parlement_; here Boccaccio has _parlamento_, i.e. a parley. Chaucer
gives it the English sense.

168. 'The love of you both, where it was before unknown.'

197. From Juvenal, Sat. x. ll. 2-4:--

               'pauci dignoscere possunt
  Vera bona atque illis multum diuersa, remota
  Erroris nebula.'

Cf. Dryden's translation and Dr. Johnson's poem on the Vanity of Human
Wishes.

198, 9. _what is to yerne_, what is desirable. _offence_, disappointment.

203. _mischaunce_; because Antenor contrived the removal from Troy of the
Palladium, on which the safety of the city depended. Cf. Lydgate, Siege of
Troye, Bk. iv. ch. 34; or the account by Caxton, quoted in Specimens of
English from 1394-1579, ed. Skeat, p. 89.

210. _here and howne._ The sense of this phrase is not known; but, judging
by the context, it seems to mean--'thus said every one, such was the common
rumour.' It has been explained as 'thus said _hare_ and _hound_,' i.e.
people of all sorts; but the M. E. form of _hare_ is _hare_ (A. S. _hara_),
and the M. E. form of 'hound' never appears as _howne_, which, by the way,
is evidently dissyllabic. In the absence of further evidence, guesswork is
hardly profitable; but I should like to suggest that the phrase may mean
'gentle and savage.' The M. E. _here_, gentle, occurs in Layamon, 25867;
and in Amis and Amiloun, 16 (Stratmann); from A. S. _h[=e]ore_. _Houne_
answers, phonetically, to an A. S. _H[=u]na_, which may mean a Hun, a
savage; cf. Ger. _Hüne_.

225. From Dante, Inf. iii. 112:--

 'Come d'autunno si levan le foglie
  L'una appresso dell' altra infin che 'l ramo
  Rende alla terra tutte le sue spoglie.'

239. This stanza follows Boccaccio closely; but Boccaccio, in his turn,
here imitates a passage in Dante, Inf. xii. 22:--

 'Qual è quel toro che si slaccia in quella
  C'ha ricevuto già 'l colpo mortale,
  Che gir non sa, ma qua e là saltella.'

251, 2. Almost repeated in the Clerk Ta. E 902, 3; see note to the latter
line, and cf. Gower, Conf. Amant. ii. 14--'Right as a lives creature She
semeth,' &c.

263. In MS. H., _thus_ is glossed by 'sine causa.'

272. Accent _misérie_ on _e_; 'Nella miseria;' Inf. v. 123.

279. _combre-world_, encumbrance of the world, a compound epithet. It is
used by Hoccleve, in his lament for Chaucer, De Regim. Principum, st. 299.
'A _cumber-world_, yet in the world am left;' Drayton, Pastorals, Ecl. ii.
25.

286. _gerful_, changeable; see note to Kn. Ta. A 1536.

300. _Edippe_, Oedipus, king of Thebes, who put out his own eyes on finding
that he had slain his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta; Statius,
Theb. i. 46.

302. Rossetti thus translates Fil. iv. st. 34: 'O soul, wretched and
astray, Why fliest thou not out of the most ill-fortuned body that lives? O
soul brought low, part from the body, and follow Chryseis.'

305. _unneste_, glossed in H. by 'go out of thi nest;' correctly.

318. Read _my_, not _the_ or _thy_; Rossetti thus translates Fil. iv. st.
36: 'O my Chryseis, O sweet bliss of the sorrowing soul which calls on
thee! Who will any more give comfort to _my_ pains?'

330. _unholsom_; Boccaccio has _insano_, Fil. iv. st. 38. 'I think it
pretty clear that B. means _insane_ in our ordinary sense for that word;
but Chaucer's _unholsom_ is no doubt founded on B.'s epithet, and is highly
picturesque.'--Rossetti.

356, 7. Nearly repeated in Man of Lawes Ta. B 608, 9. See l. 882.

381. 'As certainly do I wish it were false, as I know it is true.'

392. _propretee_, his own indefeasible possession; see Boethius, Bk. ii.
Pr. 2. 9 (p. 27), 61 (p. 28).

407. Pandarus took his morality from Ovid; cf. Amorum lib. ii. 4. 10-44:
'Centum sunt causae, cur ego semper amem;' &c.

413. _heroner_, a large falcon for herons; _faucon for rivere_, a goshawk
for waterfowl. See note to Sir Thopas, B 1927.

414, 5. From Boccaccio, who does not, however, give the name of the author
of the saying. The remark 'as Zanzis writeth' is Chaucer's own. It is quite
clear that _Zanzis_ in this passage is the same as the _Zanzis_ in the
Physiciens Tale, C 16; and he is no other than Zeuxis the painter. I do not
suppose that Chaucer had any special reason for assigning to him the
saying, but his name was as useful as that of any one else, and the
medieval method of reference is frequently so casual and light-hearted that
there is nothing to wonder at. Besides, we are distinctly told (l. 428)
that Pandarus was speaking _for the nonce_, i.e. quite at random. The real
author is Ovid: 'Successore nouo uincitur omnis amor;' Remed. Amor. 462.

460. _pleyen raket_, play at rackets, knocking the ball forwards and
backwards; alluding to the rebound of the ball after striking the wall.

461. _Netle in, dokke out_ means, as Chaucer says, first one thing and then
another. The words are taken from a charm for curing the sting of a nettle,
repeated whilst the patient rubs in the juice from a dock-leaf. The usual
formula is simply, 'in dock, out nettle,' for which see Brockett's Glossary
of North-Country Words, s. v. _dockon_ (dock); but Chaucer is doubtless
correct. He refers to a fuller form of words, given in Notes and Queries,
1st Ser. iii. 368:--

 'Nettle in, dock out--Dock in, nettle out;
  Nettle in, dock out--Dock rub nettle out.'

Akermann's Glossary of Wiltshire Words gives a third formula, as follows:--

 'Out 'ettle, in dock--Dock shall ha' a new smock;
         'Ettle zhan't ha' narrun.'

i.e. nettle shan't have ne'er one. See also N. and Q. 1st Ser. iii. 205,
368; xi. 92; Athenæum, Sept. 12, 1846; Brand, Pop. Antiq. iii. 315.

In the Testament of Love, Bk. i., the present passage is quoted in the
following form: 'Ye wete wel, lady, eke (quod I) that _I haue not playde
racket, nettyl in, docke out_, and with the wethercocke waued;' ed. 1550,
fol. cccv. col. 2. This shews that the text is correct.

462. 'Now ill luck befall her, that may care for thy wo.'

481-3. _gabbestow_, liest thou. Ll. 482, 3 are a reproduction of Pandarus'
own saying, in Bk. iii. 1625-8.

493. Deficient in the first foot; read--'I | that liv'd' | &c.

497. _formely_; Cm. _formaly_; for _formelly_, i.e. formally.

503. From Boethius, Bk. i. Met. 1. 13, 14 (p. 1).

506. Troilus speaks as if dead already. 'Well wot I, whilst I lived in
peace, before thou (death) didst slay me, I would have given (thee) hire;'
i.e. a bribe, not to attack me.

520. _alambyk_, alembic; i.e. a retort, or vessel used in distilling; in
Cant. Ta. G 794, MS. E. has the pl. _alambikes_, and most other MSS. have
_alembikes_. The word was afterwards split up into _a lembick_ or _a
limbeck_; see Macb. i. 7. 67. Chaucer took this from Le Rom. de la Rose,
6406-7:--

 'Je vois maintes fois que tu plores
  Cum alambic sus alutel.'

556. 'Then think I, this would injure her reputation.'

583. 'But if I had so ardent a love, and had thy rank.'

588. Cf. the phrase 'a nine days' wonder.' Lat. _nouendiale sacrum_; Livy,
i. 31.

600. 'Audentes Fortuna iuuat;' Æneid. x. 284; 'Fortes Fortuna adiuuat';
Terence, Phormio, i. 4. 26.

602. 'Unhardy is unsely;' Reves Ta. A 4210.

603. For _litel_, MS. H. and Thynne have _lite_. It makes no difference,
either to the sense or the scansion.

607. _for ferd_, for fear (H2. _for drede_; Thynne, _for feare_). Properly
_for ferde_, as in Ho. Fame, 950; but often shortened to _for ferd_.
_Ferde_ or _ferd_ is tolerably common as a sb., but some scribes hardly
understood it. Hence MSS. Cl. and H. have _of-fered_, i.e. greatly
frightened.

618. Cf. Kn. Ta. A 1163-8; and the notes.

622. 'Boldly stake the world on casts of the dice.' Cf. Cant. Tales, B 125,
C 653, and the notes.

627. Nearly repeated in Kn. Tale, A 1010.

630. 'The devil help him that cares about it.'

659-61. From Boccaccio, Fil. iv. st. 78; cf. Æneid. iv. 188.

683. 'And expected to please her.' _For pitous Ioye_ represents 'pietosa
allegrezza,' Fil. iv. st. 80.

684. 'Dear enough at a mite;' cf. note to L. G. Wom. 741.

692. _on every syde_; 'd'ogni partito;' Fil. iv. 81. I suppose it means,
literally, 'on every side;' Troy being subject to attacks at various
points.

708-14. Certainly genuine; found also in Fil. iv. 84.

716. Deficient in the first foot.

735. Dr. Furnivall says that MSS. Cl., H., and others have here misplaced a
stanza, meaning that ll. 750-6 should have come next, as shewn by
Boccaccio's text. But only MS. Cm. has such an order, and it is quite
certain that the other MSS. are right. The order in Boccaccio's text
furnishes no real guide, as Chaucer often transposes such order; and it is
odd that only this _one_ instance should have been noted. It is better to
consider the order in MS. Cm. as wrong, and to say that it transposes the
text by placing ll. 750-6 after l. 735, and gives a somewhat different
version of ll. 750-2.

736. _ounded_, waved, wavy; see Ho. Fame, 1386, and note. Cf. 'Tear my
bright hair,' &c.; Shak. Troilus, iv. 2. 112.

750. Cf. note to l. 735. MS. Cm., which inserts this stanza after l. 735,
begins thus:--

 'The salte teris from hyre ey[gh]yn tweyn
  Out ran, as schour of Aprille ful swythe;
  Hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne,' &c.

762. This line, giving the name of Criseyde's mother, is not in Boccaccio
(Fil. iv. stt. 89-93). I do not know where Chaucer found the form _Argyve_;
in Statius, Theb. ii. 297, _Argia_ is the name of the wife of Polynices,
and Ch. calls her _Argyve_; see Bk. v. l. 1509 below.

769, 70. _by-word_, proverb: 'plants without a root soon die.'

782. _ordre_, order. She will pass her life in mourning and abstinence, as
if she had entered a religious order.

790. _Elysos_, Elysium. It looks as if Chaucer was thinking of Vergil's
'Elysios ... campos;' Georg. i. 38; for the story of Orpheus and Eurydice
occurs in Georg. iv. 453-527. Cf. Ovid, Met. x. 1-85.

829. _cause causinge_, the primary cause. '_Causa causans_, a primary or
original cause; _causa causata_, a secondary or intermediate cause;' New E.
Dict., s. v. _Causa_.

831. _Wher_, short for _whether_; as in Cant. Ta. B 3119, &c.

836. 'Extrema gaudii luctus occupat;' Prov. xiv. 13. See note to Man of
Lawes Ta. B 421.

842. The first foot is deficient: 'Peyn | e tor | ment,' &c.

843. 'There is no misery that is not within my body.'

850. _resport_, regard; see note to l. 86 above.

865. Compare the similar lines in Kn. Ta. A 1400, 1.

866. _men_, weakened form of _man_, takes a sing. verb.

870. _Bi-trent_, winds round; see note to iii. 1231.

884. _into litel_, within a little, very nearly.

887. _fawe_, gladly; cf. Cant. Ta. D 220.

907. _bane_, destruction; see Kn. Ta. A 1097, 1681.

927. 'Be to him rather a cause of the _flat_ than of the _edge_,' i.e. of
healing rather than of harming. A curious allusion which is fully explained
by reference to the Squieres Tale, F 156-165. See also note to the same, F
238.

947-1085. This passage is not in Boccaccio, but some of it is in Boethius;
see below.

963-1078. A considerable portion of this passage is copied, more or less
closely, from Boethius, lib. v. Pr. 2 and Pr. 3. The correspondences are
all pointed out below. Chaucer's own prose translation should be compared.
For example, the word _wrythen_ (l. 986) appears in that also (Bk. v. Pr.
3. 15).

963-6. 'Quae tamen ille, ab aeterno cuncta prospiciens, prouidentiae cernit
intuitus, et suis quaeque meritis praedestinata disponit;' Boeth. v. Pr. 2
(end).

968. _grete clerkes_; such as Boethius, Saint Augustine, and bishop
Bradwardine; see Non. Pr. Ta. B 4431, 2.

974-80. 'Nam si cuncta prospicit Deus, neque falli ullo modo potest,
euenire necesse est, quod prouidentia futurum esse praeuiderit. Quare si ab
aeterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia uoluntatesque
praenoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;' Boeth. v. Pr. 3. 981-7
(_continued_): 'neque enim uel factum aliud ullum, uel quaelibet existere
poterit uoluntas, nisi quam nescia falli prouidentia diuina praesenserit.
Nam si res aliorsum, quam prouisae sunt, detorqueri ualent, non iam erit
futuri firma praescientia.' 988-994 (_continued_): 'sed opinio potius
incerta: quod de Deo credere nefas iudico.'

996. I.e. who have received the tonsure.

997-1001. 'Aiunt enim, non ideo quid esse euenturum, quoniam id prouidentia
futurum esse prospexerit: sed è contrario potius, quoniam quid futurum est,
id diuinam prouidentiam latere non posse;' Boeth. v. Pr. 3. 1002-1008
(_continued_): 'eoque modo necessarium hoc in contrariam relabi partem.
Neque enim necesse est contingere, quae prouidentur; sed necesse esse, quae
futura sunt, prouideri.' 1009-1015 (_continued_): 'Quasi uero, quae
cuiusque rei caussa sit, praescientiane futurorum necessitatis, an
futurorum necessitas prouidentiae, laboretur.' 1016-1022 (_continued_): 'At
nos illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo modo sese habeat ordo caussarum,
necessarium esse euentum praescitarum rerum, etiam si praescientia futuris
rebus eueniendi necessitatem non uideatur inferre.'

(The negative in l. 1016 is remarkable, but Chaucer's prose rendering
presents the same form. Surely he has taken _nitamur_ as if it were
_uitamus_.)

1023-9. (_continued_): 'Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quae eum
sedere coniectat ueram esse necesse est: atque è conuerso rursus, (1030-6)
si de quopiam uera sit opinio, quoniam sedet, eum sedere necesse est. In
utroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem sedendi, at uerò in altero
ueritatis.' 1037-1047 (_continued_): 'Sed non idcirco quisque sedet,
quoniam uera est opinio; sed haec potius uera est, quoniam quempiam sedere
praecessit. Ita cùm caussa ueritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen
communis in utraque necessitas. Similia de prouidentia futurisque rebus
ratiocinari patet.' 1051-78 (_continued_): 'Nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam
futura sunt, prouidentur; non uero ideo, quoniam prouidentur eueniunt:
nihilo minus tamen à Deo uel uentura prouideri, uel prouisa euenire necesse
est: quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solùm satis est. Iam uero quam
praeposterum est, ut aeternae praescientiae temporalium rerum euentus
caussa esse dicatur? Quid est autem aliud arbitrari, ideo Deum futura,
quoniam sunt euentura, prouidere, quam putare quae olim acciderunt, caussam
summae illius esse prouidentiae? Ad haec, sicuti cum quid esse scio, id
ipsum esse necesse est: ita cum quid futurum noui, id ipsum futurum necesse
est. Sic fit igitur, ut euentus praescitae rei nequeat euitari.'

1094. _ferd_, fared; not the pp. of _faren_ (l. 1087), but of the weak verb
_feren_ (A. S. _f[=e]ran_). The correct pp. of _faren_ is _faren_. See
Stratmann.

1105. 'A man may offer his neck soon enough when it (i. e. his head) must
come off.'

1136. 'Beyond the nature of tears.'

1139. Myrrha, daughter of Cinyras, king of Cyprus, who was changed into a
myrrh-tree; Ovid, Met. x. 298. The tree wept tears of myrrh; id. x. 500.

1146. _hir-e_ (MS. Cl. _here_), their, is here dissyllabic. _unswelle_,
cease to swell, as in Bk. v. 214.

1147. 'All hoarse, and exhausted with shrieking.' _forshright_ is the pp.
of _forshriken_, to shriek excessively. Bell wrongly has _for shright_; but
_shright_ is not a noun. The Ital. has 'con _rotta_ voce,' with broken
voice; Fil. iv. st. 116.

1153. 'Being always on the point of departing.'

1162. 'Whether it was sad for him.'

1174. Cf. 'And _bisily_ gan,' &c.; Prol. A 301.

1179. _preignant_ (F. _preignant_, _pregnant_, Cotgrave), catching hold of
tightly, hence, forcible; pres. part. of _prendre_, to seize. Quite
distinct from _pregnant_ when representing Lat. _praegnans_.

1181. _woon_, hope, resource. This answers to Early E. _w[=a]n_ (see
Stratmann), and is allied to Icel. _ván_, hope, expectation; cf. Icel.
_væna_, to hope for, to ween. The word is monosyllabic, and the long _o_ is
'open,' as shewn by its riming with _noon_, _goon_, from A. S. _n[=a]n_,
_g[=a]n_. Bell quite fails to explain it, and Morris suggests 'remedy,'
without assigning any reason. It is common in Rob. of Gloucester, with
similar rimes, and does not mean 'custom' or 'habit' or 'manner,' as
suggested in Mr. Wright's Glossary, nor has it any connection with M. E.
_wone_, custom, which was dissyllabic, and had a short vowel in the former
syllable; but it means, as here, 'hope' or 'resource.' For example: 'tho he
ne sey other _won_' = when he saw nothing else to be done; Rob. Glouc. ed.
Hearne, p. 12; ed. Wright, l. 275. 'And flowe in-to hor castles, vor hii
nadde other _won_,' i. e. no other resource; id. p. 19, ed. Hearne, l. 442.
This is one of the rather numerous words in Chaucer that have not been
rightly understood.

1185. _twighte_, plucked; pt. t. of _twicchen_.

1188. 'Where the doom of Minos would assign it a place.' Boccaccio here
uses the word _inferno_ (Fil. iv. 120) to denote the place where Troilus'
soul would dwell; which Rossetti explains to mean simply Hades. Chaucer's
meaning is the same; he is referring to Æneid. vi. 431-3.

1208. Atropos is the Fate who cuts the thread of life; see note to v. 7.

1237. _a forlong wey_, two minutes and a half, to speak exactly; see note
to C. T., A 3637.

1241. Either _slayn_ is here expanded into _slayen_, or the pause after
this word does duty for a syllable, in the scansion.

1242. _ho_, stop, cease; see Kn. Ta. A 1706.

1244. _ther-e_ is here made into a dissyllable.

1245. _morter_, mortar. The Century Dict. quotes from Dugdale's Hist. of
St. Paul's (ed. Ellis), p. 27: 'A _mortar_ was a wide bowl of iron or
metal; it rested upon a stand or branch, and was filled either with fine
oil or wax, which was kept burning by means of a broad wick [at funerals or
on tombs].' It was named from its similarity in shape to the _mortar_ in
which things were pounded. I remember the word in common use; it came to
denote what is now called a _night-light_, and the word _night-light_ seems
to have nearly displaced it. In this modern contrivance, the old 'mortar'
is sometimes represented by a paper casing. The term was frequently
applied, not merely to the saucer which held the grease, but to the light
itself, which sometimes took the shape of a short candle. Cotgrave explains
F. _mortier_ as 'a kind of small chamber-lamp.' Instead of _morter_, MS.
Cm. has _percher_, which meant a kind of wax candle placed upon a branch or
bar called a _perche_ (perch).

1295. 'About that (there) is no question.' Cf. l. 1694.

1374. _wether_, sheep. I. e. it is advisable to give the wolf a limb of a
sheep, in order to save the rest.

1377. _grave_, incise, make an impression upon.

1380. _moble_ (H., H2. _moeble_), movable property; cf. F. _meubles_.

1404. 'Whilst he is making his divination; and I will make him believe.'
Ll. 1401-14 are due to a passage in Guido; see allit. Destruction of Troy,
8101-40.

1406. _amphibologyes_, ambiguities. A more correct form is _amphiboly_,
from Gk. [Greek: amphibolia]; see New E. Dict. The ambiguous character of
the old oracular responses is well known.

1411. 'When he started away from Delphi for fear.' Cf. l. 607.

1422. See note to Book i. 463.

1425. _the selve wit_, the same opinion.

1435. _clere_, clear of woe, free, light. MS. H. has _chere_.

1453. 'The bear has one opinion, and his leader another.'

1456. Repeated in Kn. Ta. A 2449; see note.

1459. 'With eyes like Argus;' i. e. seeing everywhere. Argus had a hundred
eyes; Ovid, Met. i. 625.

1483. _fere_, frighten, terrify; as in Bk. ii. 124.

1505. 'To lose the substance, for the sake of something accidentally
representing it;' as when the dog dropped the piece of meat, in his anxiety
to get the shadow (or reflected image) of it. As to the famous words
_substance_ and _accident_, see note to Pard. Ta. C 539.

1525. _go we_, let us go; also written _gowe_, P. Plowm. B. Pr. 226.

1538-40. Juno caused Athamas, the husband of Ino, to run mad. As Ovid tells
the story, Juno descended into hell, and crossed the Styx, in order to
persuade the fury Tisiphone to haunt Athamas. Hence the mention of the Styx
was readily suggested. See Ovid, Met. iv. 416-561, esp. l. 434. Styx was
not, as Chaucer says, 'the pit of hell,' but a river that flowed through
it.

1544. _Satiry and Fauny_, Satyri and Fauni, Satyrs and Fauns. Chaucer was
probably thinking of Ovid, Met. vi. 392-4, where the _Fauni_, _Satyri_, and
_Nymphae_ are described as 'ruricolae, siluarum numina.' For _halve
goddes_, we now say _demigods_.

1548. _Simois_, a river of Troas; Æneid. i. 100.

1560. _laye_, would lie; subj. The _e_ is elided.

1562. _take_, take place, be made. Thynne has _be take_, but _be_ clogs the
line, and is not in the MSS.

1584. 'Vincit qui patitur;' see Frank. Ta. F 773.

1585. 'He who will have what he wants must give up what he likes.' Such
seems to be the sense intended. _Leef_ means 'dear.' One of Heywood's
proverbs is--'Nought lay down, nought take up;' and very similar to this
is--'Nothing venture, nothing have.' For the second _leef_, MS. H. has
_lyfe_, a reading adopted by Bell and Morris. This takes all point out of
the saying, and does not seem applicable to the case. Ll. 1587 and 1588
repeat the saying in another form, and confirm the reading in the text. Cf.
Boeth. Bk. ii. Pr. 4. 98.

1591, 2. _Lucina_, i. e. Diana, or the moon; cf. Kn. Ta. A 2085. 'Before
the moon pass out of the sign of Aries beyond that of Leo.' In order to
this, the moon would have to pass wholly through Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
and Leo, thus traversing a distance represented by about 4 signs, or a
third part of the whole zodiac: this would take up about the third part of
28 days, or more than 9 days. This brings us, as Criseyde says, to the 10th
day (l. 1595). Such a method of counting is natural enough to those that
watch the moon's course; and lovers are generally credited with taking a
special interest in that luminary; cf. l. 1608. In the sequel, a good deal
turns upon this 'tenth day.' Cf. ll. 1320, 1328, 1685; V. 239, 642, 681,
1103, 1206.

1608. _Cynthia_, i. e. Diana, the moon; Ovid, Met. ii. 465.

1612. 'To lose one opportunity, in order to gain another.'

1620. _pure_, very; as in Kn. Ta. A 1279.

1628. 'Who can hold a thing that tries to get away?'

             'An eel and woman,
  A learned poet says, unless by th' tail
  And with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail.'
               The Two Noble Kinsmen, A. iii. sc. 5. l. 49.

1645. 'Res est solliciti plena timoris amor;' Ovid, Her. i. 12.

1667-73. In Boccaccio, a stanza of a similar character is assigned to
Troilus, not to Criseyde.

1677. _poeplish_; Boccaccio (Fil. iv. st. 165) has _popolesco_, which
Rossetti translates by 'low-bred.' Florio's Ital. Dict. has: '_popolesco_,
popular, of the common people.'

1682. _fórtun-è_ is trisyllabic.


BOOK V.

The following sketch gives a general notion of the relation of this Book to
the Filostrato, though Chaucer often amplifies and transposes the material
in a way that it would be tedious to particularise more minutely.

  TROILUS: BOOK V.     FILOSTRATO.

  ll. 1-7.                  [_Teseide_, Bk. ix. st. 1.]

      841-1001.                "    9, 11-31.
      1100-1274.            Bk. vii. 1-33.

      1523-1554.               "    100-102, 104, 106.
      1555-1589.            Bk. viii. 1-5.
      1632-1701.               "    6-15.
      1702-1768.               "    21, 17, 19-26.
      1800-1806.               "    27.
      1807-1827.            [_Teseide_, Bk. xi. 1-3.]
      1828-1841.               "    28, 29.
      1863-1865.            [Dante, _Par._ xiv. 28-30.]

3. _Parcas_, Fates; the accusative case, as usual.

7. _Lachesis_, the Fate that apportions the thread of life; often
represented with the spindle, though this is properly the attribute of
Clotho alone. Clotho spins, Lachesis apportions, and Atropos cuts, the
thread of life. Atropos has been mentioned above; Bk. iv. 1208, 1546.
Statius mentions all three in lib. iii. of his Thebaid; Clotho at l. 556,
Lachesis (Lachesim putri uacuantem saecula penso) at l. 642, and Atropos at
l. 68.

8. For _golden tressed_, MS. Harl. 3943 has _Auricomus tressed_ (!). Cf.
'Sol auricomus, cingentibus Horis;' Valerius Flaccus, Argonaut. iv. 92.

12, 13. _sone of Hecuba_, Troilus; _hir_, Criseyde.

15-9. Note that ll. 15, 17 rime on _-éde_, with close _e_, but ll. 16, 18,
19 rime on _-ède_, with open _e_. Cf. Anelida, 299-307.

22-6. Lines 22, 24 rime on _-[=o]re_, with long close _o_; ll. 23, 25, 26
on _-[)o]re_, with (original) short open _o_.

25. _crop_, shoot, upper part of a tree. _more_, root, still in use in
Hants; A. S. _more_, _moru_; see P. Plowman, B. xvi. 5, C. xviii. 21.

53. 'Upon the report of such behaviour of his.'

65. So in Boccaccio: 'Con un falcone in pugno;' Fil. v. st. 10.

67. A mistranslation. Boccaccio's word is not _valle_, a valley, but
_vallo_, a rampart. The first foot lacks a syllable.

71. Antenor was the Trojan, captured by the Greeks, who was restored to
Troy in exchange for Thoas and Criseyde.

88. _sone of Tydeus_, i. e. Diomede, often called _Tydides_; as in Æneid.
i. 97, 471, &c.

89. To know one's creed is very elementary knowledge.

90. _by the reyne hir hente_; Rossetti thinks Chaucer misunderstood _di
colei si piglia_ (Fil. v. 13), which might mean 'takes hold of her,' but
really means 'takes a fancy to her.'

98. This resembles 'to take care of No. 1.'

101. _make it tough_, raise a difficulty, viz. by disparaging Troilus.

106. _coude his good_, knew what was good for him, knew what he was about.
Bell says--'understood good manners.'

128. _helply_; we now say 'helpful,' i.e. serviceable. _to my might_, to
the best of my power.

143. _O god of love_, one and the same god of love.

151. _this_, contracted form of _this is_. _enseled_, sealed up.

158. _As paramours_, as by way of love. Cf. l. 332.

180. See below (l. 530), and Man of Lawes Ta. B 697. We can read either
_brast_ (burst), or _braste_ (would burst).

182. _sye_, to sink down; A. S. _s[=i]gan_; see _si[gh]en_ in Stratmann.

194. _mewet_, mute; as in the Court of Love, 148. _Mewet_, _muwet_, or
_muet_ is from the O. F. _muët_, orig. dissyllabic, and answering to a Low
Lat. diminutive type _*mutettum_. The E. word is now obsolete, being
displaced by the simple form _mute_, borrowed directly from Lat. _mutus_,
which in O. F. became _mu_. _Mute_ is common in Shakespeare. Lydgate has:
'And also clos and _muët_ as a stone;' Siege of Thebes, pt. iii. § 8. In
Merlin, ed. Wheatley, p. 172, we find 'stille and _mewet_ as though thei
hadde be dombe.'

The _-e_ in _mild-e_ is not elided; the A. S. _milde_ is dissyllabic.

208. _Cipryde_, i.e. Cypris, or Venus; see note to Parl. Foules, 277.

212. The _-ie_ in _furie_ is rapidly slurred over. _Ixion_ is accented on
the _first_ syllable. Ixion was bound, in hell, to an ever-revolving wheel;
Georg. iii. 38; Æn. vi. 601.

249. _as mete_, as (for instance) dream; see l. 251.

283. 'Although he had sworn (to do so) on forfeit of his head.'

304. _pálestrál_, i.e. games consisting of wrestling-matches and similar
contests; from Lat. _palaestra_; see Verg. Æn. iii. 280, 281; and G.
Douglas, ed. Small, vol. iii. p. 52, l. 24. There is a description of such
games, held at a funeral, in Statius, Theb. vi., which is imitated by
Chaucer in the Knightes Tale; see note to A 2863. _Vigile_ (l. 305) is the
same as Chaucer's _liche-wake_; see note to A 2958.

306. He means that his steed, sword, and helm are to be offered up to Mars,
and his shield to Pallas, at his funeral; cf. Kn. Ta. A 2889-2894.

319. _Ascaphilo_, a transposed form of Ascalaphus, whom Proserpine changed
into an owl; Ovid, Met. v. 539. So also _Adriane_ for Ariadne. Bell's note,
that the form of _Ascaphilo_ is Italian, and helps to prove that Chaucer
here follows Boccaccio is misleading; for Boccaccio does not mention
Ascalaphus.

321. Mercury was supposed to convey men's souls to Hades. See l. 1827
below, and note.

332. _paramours_, passionately; an adverb, as usual; cf. l. 158.

345. _By freendes might_, by constraint of their relatives.

350. _hurt_, for _hurteth_, hurts; present tense.

360. On dreams, cf. Non. Pr. Ta. B 4113-4129, 4280-4.

365-8. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 18709-12, q. v.

379. Lit. 'Well is it, concerning dreams, to these old wives;' i.e. these
old women set a value on dreams.

387. Boccaccio has: 'a te stesso perdona,' i.e. spare thyself; Chaucer
takes it literally--'forgive thyself.'

403. Sarpedon had been taken prisoner by the Greeks (iv. 52). Neither
Boccaccio nor Chaucer explains how he had got back to Troy. See l. 431.

409. _iouken_, slumber; cf. P. Plowman, C. xix. 126. It was chiefly used as
a term in falconry, and applied to hawks. In the Boke of St. Albans, fol. a
6, we are told that it is proper to say that 'your hauke _Ioukith_, and not
slepith.' From O. F. _joquier_, _jouquier_; see Godefroy.

421. _of fyne force_, by very necessity.

451. I read 'piëtous,' as in MS. H., not 'pitous,' for the sake of the
metre, as in Bk. iii. 1444; cf. _pietee_, id. 1033. Perhaps Chaucer was
thinking of the Ital. _pietoso_. We also find the spelling _pitevous_, for
which form there is sufficient authority; see Wyclif, 2 Tim. iii. 12, Titus
ii. 12; Rob. of Glouc. ed. Wright, 5884 (footnote); cf. Mod. E. _piteous_.
Chaucer's usual word is _pitous_, as in Cant. Ta. B 449, 1059, C 298, &c.

460. _For_, because; as frequently.

469. 'Fortune intended to glaze his hood still better.' To 'glaze one's
hood' was to furnish a man with a glass hood, a jocular phrase for to mock
or expose to attack; because a glass hood would be no defence at all.
Chaucer himself admirably illustrates this saying in a passage which has
already occurred above; see Bk. ii. 867.

478. _her-e_ is dissyllabic; as in Ho. Fame, 980, 1014, 1885, 1912, &c.

479. _congeyen us_, bid us take leave, dismiss us.

484. 'Did we come here to fetch light for a fire, and run home again?' A
man who borrows a light must hurry back before it goes out.

505. _Hasel-wode_, hazel-wood; an allusion to a popular saying, expressive
of incredulity. See note to l. 1174 below. Not the same proverb as that in
Bk. iii. 890.

541. 'O house, formerly called the best of houses.' Bell and Morris place
the comma after _houses_.

552. As to kissing the door, see note to Rom. Rose, 2676.

601. Referring, probably, to Statius, Theb. i. 12--'Quod saeuae Iunonis
opus.' But this refers to the wrath of Juno against Athamas rather than
against Thebes.

642. 'Wherefore, if, on the tenth night, I fail (to have) the guiding of
thy bright beams for a single hour,' &c.

655. Here Thynne's reading, _Lucina_, is obviously correct; see Bk. iv.
1591. By the common mistake of writing _t_ for _c_, it became Lutina, and
was then changed into _Latona_. But Latona was Lucina's _mother_.

664. _Pheton_, Phaethon; alluding to Ovid, Met. ii. 34, 47, &c.

744. Prudence is here represented with _three_ eyes, to behold present,
past, and future; but Creseyde had but _two_ eyes, and failed to see what
was to come. Cf. 'rerum fato Prudentia maior;' Georg. i. 416.

763. 'I call it felicity when I have what satisfies me;' cf. the parallel
passage in Prol. A 338; and Boeth. Bk. iii. Pr. 2. 6-8.

769. _knotteles_; 'like a thread in which there is no knot.'

784. 'Nothing venture, nothing have.'

805. In Lydgate's Siege of Troye, we are told that Diomede brought 80 ships
with him 'fro Calidonye and Arge;' Bk. ii. ch. 16, in the catalogue of the
ships. The English alliterative Romance omits this passage. _Arge_ is the
town of Argos, ruled over by Diomede; Homer, Il. ii. 559. _Calidoine_ is
Calydon, in Ætolia, of which city Tydeus, father of Diomede, was king; see
l. 934, and ll. 1513-5 below.

806. This description seems to be mainly Chaucer's own. It occurs again,
much amplified, in Lydgate's Siege of Troy, Bk. ii. ch. 15, where it
precedes the description of Priam. Boccaccio says that she had 'lucent eyes
and an angelic face' (Fil. i. st. 28), with which cf. l. 816. He also
describes her as 'Accorta, savia, onesta, e costumata,' which Rossetti
translates by 'Discerning, wise, honourable, and high-bred' (Fil. i. 11);
cf. ll. 820, 821.

827. Troilus is described by Guido delle Colonne; see the translations, in
the alliterative Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson, l. 3922,
and in Lydgate's Siege of Troye, Bk. ii. ch. 16.

836. Troilus was second to Hector in prowess (Bk. ii. 158, 644), but not in
courage (Bk. i. 474).

837. _durring don_, daring to do, courage; where _durring_ is a sb. formed
from _durren_, to dare. So in l. 840, _to durre don_ is 'to dare to do.' It
is quite a mistake to regard _durring don_ as a compound word, as is
usually done by such as are ignorant of Middle English grammar. Spenser
borrowed the phrase, but may have misunderstood it. In the Globe edition of
Spenser, _derring-doe_ occurs _with a hyphen_, in Shep. Kal. _Oct._ l. 65,
but _as two words_, in F. Q. ii. 4. 42, vi. 5. 37. In F. Q. ii. 7. 10, we
find 'in _der-doing_ armes,' which I leave to be explained by the
omniscient critic.

852. See the parallel line, Squi. Ta. F 294; cf. Bk. iii. 674.

883. _as who seyth_, so to speak.

892. _Manes_, the departed spirits or shades of the dead. He means that
even these will dread the Greeks. The idea that they are the 'gods of pain'
is taken from Vergil, Æn. vi. 743; cf. Statius, Theb. viii. 84. Boccaccio
merely has 'tra' morti in inferno'; Fil. vi. st. 16.

897. _ambages_, ambiguities; adapted from Boccaccio's 'ambage' (Fil. vi.
st. 17), which Ch. has to explain.

911-938. These lines are fairly close to the original.

934. See note above, to l. 805. B. has: 'Di Calidonia e d' Argo;' Fil. vi.
st. 24.

937. Tydeus, father of Diomede, is one of the chief heroes in the Thebaid
of Statius, which describes the struggle between Eteocles and Polynices
(called _Polymites_ in l. 938) for the possession of Thebes. Tydeus and
Polynices married sisters, the daughters of Adrastus, king of Argos; hence
their alliance. For the death of Tydeus in battle, see the conclusion of
Book viii of the Thebaid. See ll. 1480-1501 below.

971. _Orcades_, the Orkney islands, very remote from Rome; Juvenal, Sat.
ii. 161. _Inde_, India, remote from Rome in the other direction; Vergil,
Æn. vi. 794. Here the point of view is transferred from Rome to Troy.

975. She was a widow; Bk. i. 97. In l. 977, she lies boldly.

992. 'When I see what I have never seen yet (viz. Troy taken), perhaps I
will do what I have never yet done (i. e. think of a second husband).'

1013. This incident is not in Boccaccio; but it occurs in Guido delle
Colonne, which Chaucer must therefore have consulted. The alliterative
Destruction of Troy duly records the circumstance, ll. 8092-4:--

 'A gloue of that gay gate he belyue,
  Drogh hit full dernly the damsell fro;
  None seond but hir-selfe, that suffert full well.'

1016. I. e. Venus was seen as 'the evening-star.'

1018, 9. _Cynthea_, i. e. the moon; Bk. iv. 1608. In Bk. iv. l. 1591,
Criseyde had promised to return before the moon passed out of the sign Leo.
This was now on the point of happening; the moon was leaving Leo, to pass
into Virgo.

1020. _Signifer_, the 'sign-bearer,' the zodiac. 'This forseide hevenish
zodiak is cleped the cercle of the signes;' Astrolabe, pt. i. § 21. The
zodiac extended, north and south, to the breadth of 6 degrees on both sides
of the ecliptic line, thus forming a belt 12 degrees wide. This included
numerous bright stars, such as Regulus ([alpha] Leonis) and Spica Virginis
([alpha] Virginis), here called 'candles.' Chaucer may have found the word
_Signifer_ in Claudian, In Rufinum, i. 365.

1039. _he wan_, he took in battle. Thynne reads _she_; but _he_ is right.
Diomede got possession of Troilus' horse, and sent it to Criseyde;
whereupon she said that Diomede might keep it for himself. Note that
Chaucer refers us to 'the story' for this incident; by which he means the
_Historia Troiana_ of Guido. But Guido only goes as far as to say that
Diomed sent Troilus' horse to Criseyde; the rest is Chaucer's addition. See
the allit. Destruction of Troy, ll. 8296-8317; and Lydgate's Siege of
Troye, Bk. iii. ch. 26, ed. 1557, fol. R 4, back. Cf. Shak. Troilus, v. 5.
1: '_Dio._ Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse, Present the fair
steed to my lady Cressid.' The incidents of the 'broche' and 'pensel' are
Chaucer's own; see Bk. iii. 1370-2.

1043. _pencel_, short for _penoncel_, a little pennon or banner; here it
means that Diomede wore a sleeve of hers as a streamer on his helmet or
arm. This was a common custom; cf. Shak. Troil. v. 2. 69, 169. '_Pensell_,
a lytel baner;' Palsgrave; and see P. Plowm. C. xix. 189.

1044. _the stories elles-wher_, i.e. in another part of Guido's _Historia_,
viz. in Book xxv; see the allit. Destruct. of Troy, ll. 9942-9959, and
Lydgate's Siege of Troye, Bk. iv. ch. 30, ed. 1557, fol. U 4.

1051. I cannot find this in Guido.

1062. 'My bell shall be rung;' my story shall be told.

1104. I.e. 'on the morrow of which.'

1107. Cf. 'laurigero ... Phoebo'; Ovid, Art. Am. iii. 389.

1110. 'Nisus' daughter,' i.e. Scylla, changed into the bird _ciris_, which
some explain as a lark; see Leg. Good Wom. 1908, and note; Ovid, Met. viii.
9-151; Vergil, Georg. i. 404-9.

1114. _noon_, noon, mid-day; the time for dinner (see l. 1129, and Cant.
Ta. E 1893). See my note to Piers Plowm. C. ix. 146.

1133. _cape_, gape; see Miller's Tale, A 3444, 3841 (footnotes).

1140, 1. _yate_, i.e. port-cullis. _As nought ne were_, as if there were no
special reason for it. I.e. I will make them do it, without telling them
why.

1151. Deficient in the first foot; hardly a good line.

1155. 'Think it not tedious to (have to) wait.'

1162. _fare-cart_, cart for provisions; cf. our phrase 'to enjoy good
_fare_.' It might mean 'travelling-car,' but that is inapplicable. B. has
simply 'carro;' Fil. vii. 8.

1163-9. Cf. Romeo's speech in Rom. v. 1. 1-11.

1174. 'The happiness which you expect will come out of the wood,' i.e. if
it comes at all. A jocular form of expressing unlikelihood. There is
evidently a reference to some popular song or saying; compare the Jeu de
Robin in Toynbee's Specimens of Old French, p. 224. In the Rom. of the
Rose, 7455, we have an allusion to a 'ioly Robin,' who was a gay dancer and
a minstrel, and the exact opposite of a Jacobin friar. Shakespeare's clown
in Twelfth Night (iv. 2. 78) sings of a 'jolly Robin' whose lady 'loves
another.' And Ophelia sang 'bonny sweet Robin is all my joy;' Haml. iv. 5.
187.

1176. Another proverbial saying, _ferne yere_, last year; see _fern, fürn_,
in Stratmann, and cf. A. S. _fyrng[=e]arum fr[=o]d_, wise with the
experience of past years, Phoenix, 219. Last year's snow will not be seen
again.

1190. He persuades himself that the moon is to pass well beyond the end of
the sign Leo; thus allowing another day.

1222. _by potente_, with a stick, or staff with a spiked end and
crutch-like top; cf. Somp. Ta. D 1776. A _potent_, in heraldry, is a figure
resembling the top of a crutch, consisting of a rectangle laid horizontally
above a small square. See Rom. of the Rose, 368.

1274. 'Whereas I daily destroy myself by living.'

1313. _rolleth_, revolves; see Pard. Ta. C 838; Somn. Ta. D 2217.

1335. 'And for that which is defaced, ye may blame the tears.'

1354. 'I sigh with sorrowful sighs.' MS. Cm. has _sikis I sike_.

1368. 'I can only say that, being a receptacle for every sorrow, I was
still alive.' _cheste_, box; like that of Pandora.

1372. 'Until I see the contents of your reply.'

1431. 'Bottomless promises;' i. e. that held nothing.

1433. See the parallel line, Kn. Ta. A 1838, and note.

1450. _Sibille_, the Sibyl, the prophetess; not here a proper name, but an
epithet of Cassandra. Cf. Æneid. vi. 98.

1464. (Ll. 1457-1512 are not in Boccaccio.) The story of Meleager and the
Calydonian boar-hunt is told at length in Ovid, Met. viii. 271, &c.; whence
Chaucer doubtless took it; cf. l. 1469 with Met. viii. 282. The 'mayde,' in
l. 1473, was Atalanta.

1480. Chaucer seems to be mistaken here. Tydeus, according to one account,
was Meleager's brother; and, according to another, his half-brother. He
does not tell us to what 'olde bokes' he refers.

1483. _moder_; his mother Althaea; see Ovid, Met. viii. 445.

LATIN LINES: Argument of the 12 books of the Thebaid of Statius. These
lines are placed, in the MSS., after l. 1498, interrupting the connection.
I therefore insert them after l. 1484, which is certainly their proper
place. Ll. 1485-1510 give a loose rendering of them. I subjoin an epitome,
in a more intelligible form; but suppress many details not mentioned in
Chaucer.

BOOK I. Polynices and Tydeus meet, and become allies.

II. Tydeus sets out on an embassy to Eteocles at Thebes, and escapes an
ambush by the way (ll. 1485-1491). He spares Mæon, one of his 50
assailants, and sends him to Thebes with the news, whilst he himself
returns to Argos instead of proceeding to Thebes (1492-3).

III. Maeon (also called Haemonides, as being the son of Haemon, Bk. iii. l.
42) returns to Thebes, and relates how Tydeus had slain 49 men out of 50.
At Argos, Amphiaraus, the augur, had concealed himself, hoping to delay the
war against Thebes, which he prophesied would be disastrous; but Capaneus
forces him from his retirement, and war is resolved upon (1494).

IV. The seven chiefs set out against Thebes. The army suffers from thirst,
but Hypsipyle, a Lemnian princess, appears, and shews them a river (1495).

V. Hypsipyle relates the story of 'the furies of Lemnos,' i. e. of the
Lemnian women who killed all the men in the island except Thoas, her
father, whom she saved. (See Leg. of Good Women, 1467, and note.) While she
is speaking, a snake, sent by Jupiter, kills her infant, named Archemorus.
The snake is killed by Capaneus (1497, 8).

VI. Description of the obsequies of Archemorus, and of the funeral games
(1499).

VII. Description of the temple of Mars (see Knightes Tale). The allies
arrive before Thebes, and the city is attacked. Amphiaraus is swallowed up
by an earthquake (1500).

VIII. Tydeus is slain, after a great slaughter of his enemies (1501).

IX. Hippomedon, after great deeds of valour, is drowned in the river. Death
of Parthenopaeus (1502, 3).

X. Capaneus is killed by lightning whilst scaling the walls of Thebes
(1504, 5).

XI. Single combat between Eteocles and Polynices; both are slain (1506-8).

XII. Creon forbids the burial of the slain invaders. The wives of the six
chieftains seek assistance from Theseus, king of Athens (see Knightes
Tale). Argia, wife of Polynices, finds and burns her husband's body.
Theseus slays Creon, and the Thebans open their gates to him (1509-10).

1485-1491. From the Thebaid, Bk. i (see above). _felawe_, comrade,
brother-in-law. _Polymites_, Polynices. _Ethyocles_, Eteocles.

1492-8. From the same, Books ii-v. _Hemonides_, Haemonides, i. e. Maeon,
son of Haemon. _asterte_, escaped. _fifty_; but he only slew 49, though
attacked by 50. _sevene_; the seven chieftains, who went to besiege Thebes.
_holy serpent_, the snake sent by Jupiter. _welle_, (apparently) the stream
Langia, which refreshed the army (end of Bk. iv). _The furies_, the furious
women of Lemnos, who killed all the males (but one) in the island.

1499-1505. From the same, Bks. vi-x. _Archimoris_, Archemorus, infant son
of Hypsipyle; honoured by funeral games. _Amphiorax_, Amphiaraus; see Bk.
ii. 105, and note to Anelida, 57. _Argeyes_, Argives, people of Argos.
_Ypomedon_, Hippomedon; _Parthonope_, Parthenopaeus; see note to Anelida,
58. _Cappaneus_, Capaneus; see note to Anelida, 59.

1506-1512. From the same, Bks. xi, xii. _Argyve_, Argia, wife of Polynices;
cf. Bk. iv. l. 762, above. _brent_, burnt; see Kn. Ta. A 990; but Statius
says that the Thebans opened their gates to Theseus, who entered in
triumph. I find nothing about any harm done to the city on this occasion.

1514. But Tydeus was Meleager's brother; see note to l. 1480.

1518. _leef_, leave it alone. Usually _leve_.

1523. _seestow_, seest thou; a general observation, _not_ addressed to
Cassandra in particular, but to every one at large.

1527. _Alceste_, Alcestis; see Leg. of Good Women, 432.

1528. _but_, except, unless. Yet Bell misunderstands it.

1530. _housbonde_; Admetus, king of Pherae, in Thessaly.

1545. _smitted_, smutted, disgraced; cf. l. 1546.

1548. _fyn of the paródie_, end of the period. Chaucer, not being a Greek
scholar, has somewhat mistaken the form of the word; but, in MS. H.,
_parodie_ is duly glossed by 'duracion,' shewing the sense intended. It is
from the O. F. fem. sb. _perióde_, or _peryóde_, of which Littré gives an
example in the 14th century: '_Peryode_ est le temps et la mesure de la
_duracion_ d'une chose;' Oresme, Thèse de Meunier. Chaucer, being more
familiar with the prefix _per-_ than with the Greek [Greek: peri-], has
dropped the _i_; and the confusion between _per-_ and _par-_ is extremely
common, because both prefixes were denoted, in contracted writing, by the
same symbol. We may give up the old attempts at explaining the word
otherwise, as we know that the glosses are usually due to the author. 'The
end of the period of Hector's life was nigh at hand.'

Lydgate uses the word in the same sense, having caught it up from the
present passage:--

 'When the _paródye_ of this worthy knyght [Hector]
  Aproche shall, without[e] wordes mo,
  Into the fyelde playnly if he go.'
           Siege of Troye, Bk. iii. ch. 27; ed. 1557, fol. R 6.

 'And how that he [Ulysses] might[e] not escape
  The _párodye_ that was for hym shape;
  For Parchas haue his last[e] _terme_ set,' &c.
                               Id., Bk. v. ch. 38; fol. Dd 3.

Observe that _parodye_ is here equated to _terme_.

1558. From Guido; according to whose account Hector, having taken a
prisoner, was conveying him through the throng, when Achilles thrust him
through with a spear in a cowardly manner, stealing up to him unperceived.
See allit. Dest. of Troy, ll. 8649-8660; Lydgate, Siege of Troy, Bk. iii.
ch. 27, fol. S 2, back; Shak. Troil. v. 6. 27, 8. 1.

1634. _kalendes_, an introduction to the beginning; see note to Bk. ii. 7.

1653. _Lollius_; this incident is in the Filostrato, viii. st. 8; I do not
find it in Guido.

1669. _word and ende_, beginning and end; see note to Monk. Ta. B 3911; and
note to Bk. ii. 1495.

1689. 'To present your new love with.'

1760. See note to Book i. 463.

1764. Here the story practically ends. Beyond this point, the lines taken
from Boccaccio are less than twenty.

1771. _Dares_, i. e. Guido, who professes to follow Dares; see note to Book
Duch. 1070.

1778. I. e. Chaucer was beginning to think of his Legend of Good Women.

1786. Here begins the Envoy (interrupted by ll. 1800-1827). Compare the
last three lines of the Filostrato (ix. 8):--

 'Or va'; ch' io prego Apollo che ti presti
  Tanto di grazia ch' ascoltata sii,
  E con lieta risposa a me t'invii.'

1787. 'Whereas may God send power to him that wrote thee to take part in
composing some "comedy," before he die.'

1789. 'Do not envy any (other) poetry, but be humble.'

1791. Imitated from the concluding lines of the Thebaid, xii. 816:--

           'nec tu diuinam Æneida tenta,
  Sed longe sequere, et _uestigia semper adora_.'

The sense is--'And kiss their footsteps, wherever you see Vergil, &c. pass
along.' The reading _space_ is ridiculous; and, in l. 1792, the names
_Virgíle_, &c., are accented on the second syllable. _Steppes_ means
'foot-prints,' Lat. _uestigia_; see Leg. Good Women, 2209.

1792. An important line. Chaucer, in this poem, has made use of Statius
(see l. 1485), Ovid (in many places), Vergil (occasionally), and Homer (not
at first hand). Lucan seems to be mentioned only out of respect; but see
note to Bk. ii. 167. He is mentioned again in Boethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 159.

1796. _mismetre_, scan wrongly. This shews that Chaucer was conscious of
his somewhat archaic style, and that there was a danger that some of the
syllables might be dropped.

1797. _red_, read (by a single person), _songe_, read aloud, recited in an
intoned voice.

1802. _thousandes_ is to be taken in the literal sense. On one occasion,
according to Guido, Troilus slew a thousand men at once. See the allit.
Destruction of Troy, 9878; Lydgate, Siege of Troy, fol. U 3, back, l. 7.

1806. So in Guido; see allit. Destr. of Troy, 10302-11; Lydgate, Siege of
Troye, Bk. iv. ch. 31. Cf. l. 1558, and the note.

1807-1827. These three stanzas are from Boccaccio's _Teseide_, xi. 1-3,
where, however, they refer to Arcita:--

 'Finito Arcita colei nominando
  La qual nel mondo più che altro amava,
  L'anima lieve se ne gì volando
  Vêr la concavità del cielo ottava:
  Degli elementi i conuessi lasciando,
  Quivi le stelle erratiche ammirava ...
  Suoni ascoltando pieni di dolcezza.

  Quindi si volse in giù a rimirare
  Le cose abbandonate, e vide il poco
  Globo terreno, a cui d'intorno il mare
  Girava ...
  Ed ogni cosa da nulla stimare
  A respetto del ciel; e in fine al loco
  Là dove aveva il corpo suo lasciato
  Gli occhi fermò alquanto rivoltato.

  E fece risa de' pianti dolenti
  Della turba lernea; la vanitate
  Forte dannando delle umane genti,
  Le qua' da tenebrosa cechitate
  Mattamente oscurate nelle menti
  Seguon del Mondo la falsa beltate:
  Lasciando il cielo, quindi se ne gio
  Nel loco a cui Mercurio la sortio.'

_holownesse_ translates 'concavità.' For _seventh_, B. has 'ottava,'
eighth. The seventh sphere is that of Saturn, from which he might be
supposed to observe the motion of Saturn and of all the inferior planets.
But surely _eighth_ is more correct; else there is no special sense in
'holownesse.' The eighth sphere is that of the fixed stars; and by taking
up a position on the _inner_ or _concave_ surface of this sphere, he would
see all the planetary spheres revolving within it. (The 'spheres' were
supposed to be concentric shells, like the coats of an onion.) The 'erratic
stars,' or wandering stars, are the seven planets. As to the music of their
spheres, see notes to Parl. Foules, ll. 59 and 61.

1810. _in convers leting_, leaving behind, on the other side. When, for
example, he approached the sphere of Mars, it was _concave_ to him; after
passing beyond it, it appeared _convex_. Some modern editions of the
Teseide read _connessi_ (connected parts), but the right reading is
_conuessi_ (convex surfaces), for which Chaucer substitutes _convers_. See
_converse_ in the New E. Dictionary.

1815. Cf. Parl. Foules, 57. Boccaccio had in mind Cicero's _Somnium
Scipionis_.

1825. _sholden_, and we ought; _we_ is understood.

1827. _sorted_, allotted; Ital. 'sortio.'

1828-1837. Chiefly from Il Filostrato, viii. 28, 29.

1838-1862. These lines are Chaucer's own, and assume a higher strain.

1840. 'This lyf, my sone, is but a chery-feyre.'
           Hoccleve, De Regim. Princ. ed. Wright, p. 47.

See four more similar comparisons in Halliwell's Dict., s. v.
_Cherry-fair_.

1856. _moral Gower._ This epithet of Gower has stuck to him ever since; he
moralises somewhat too much.

1857. _Strode._ Concerning this personage, Leland discovered the following
note in an old catalogue of the worthies of Merton College, Oxford:
'Radulphus Strode, nobilis poeta fuit et versificavit librum elegiacum
vocatum Phantasma Radulphi.' In the introduction to his edition of 'Pearl,'
p. l., Mr. Gollancz says: 'This Ralph Strode is identical with the famous
philosopher of that name whose philosophical works hold an important place
in the history of medieval logic. He was also famous in his time as a
controversialist with Wiclif, and from Wiclif MSS., still unprinted, it is
possible to gain some insight into Strode's religious views.' He was,
perhaps, related to the philosopher N. Strode, who is mentioned at the end
of pt. ii. § 40 of the Treatise on the Astrolabe as being the tutor, at
Oxford, of Chaucer's son Lewis.

1863-5. From Dante, Paradiso, xiv. 28-30:--

 'Quell' uno e due e tre che sempre vive,
  E regna sempre in tre e due e uno,
  Non circonscritto, e tutto circonscrive.'


ADDITIONAL NOTE TO BOOK III. 674.

As the curious word _voidee_ has been suppressed in all previous editions,
I add some more examples of it, for some of which I am indebted to Dr.
Murray. It occurs, e.g., in the extremely interesting account of the death
of James I of Scotland.

'Within an owre the Kyng askid the _voidee_, and drank, the travers yn the
chambure edraw [= _y-drawe_, drawn], and every man depairtid and went to
rist': (1400) JN. SHIRLEY, Dethe of James Stewarde, Kyng of Scotys, p. 13,
ed. 1818.

Hence, no doubt, Mr. Rossetti, in his poem of The King's Tragedy, drew the
line:--'Then he called for the _voidee_-cup.'

'A _voidy_ of spices': (1548) Hall's Chron. 14 Hen. VIII.

'A _voidee_ of spices': (1577-87) Holinshed's Chron. vol. iii. p. 849.

In A Collection of Ordinances and Regulations for the Royal Household,
London, 1790, there are several examples of it.

'The Archbishoppe to stand on the Kinges right hand, and the King to make
him a becke when hee shall take _spice and wine_. And when the _voide_ is
donne, then the King to goe into his chamber; and all other estates to goe
into their chambers, or where it shall please them,' &c.: p. 111; in
Articles ordained by King Henry VII.

At p. 113, there are minute directions as to the _voidè_. The chamberlain
and others fetch a towel, the cups, and the spice-plates; the king and the
bishop take 'spice and wine,' and afterwards the lords and people are
served 'largely' with spice and wine also; after which the cups are
removed. At p. 36, we read: 'the bourde _avoyded_ [cleared] when wafyrs
come with ypocras, or with other swete wynes. The King never taketh a
_voyd_ [read _voydè_] of comfites and other spices, but standing.' At p.
121: 'as for the voide on twelfth day at night, the King and Queene ought
to take it in the halle.' At the Coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn, there was
a voidè 'of spice-plates and wine'; English Garner, ed. Arber, ii. 50.

The _voidee_ was, in fact, a sort of dessert. The word _spices_ included
many things besides what it now implies. In the Ordinances above-mentioned,
there is a list of spices, at p. 103. It includes pepper, saffron, ginger,
cloves, maces, cinnamon, nutmegs, dates, prunes, quinces, comfits, raisins,
currants, figs, and even rice. In the North of England, even at the present
day, it includes sweetmeats, gingerbread, cakes, and dried fruits.

     because Jean de Meun had selected for similar treatment the very same
     passage; see Rom. de la Rose, ll. 8395-8406.

[10] There is a copy of this in the British Museum, MS. Addit. 10341.

[11] MS. Harl. 44 (Wülker); _not_ MS. Harl. 43, as in Warton, who has
     confused this MS. with that next mentioned.

[12] MS. Harl. 43 (Wülker); _not_ MS. Harl. 44, as in Warton.

[13] There is a better copy than either of the above in MS. Royal 18 A.
     xiii. The B. M. Catalogue of the Royal MSS., by Casley, erroneously
     attributes this translation to Lydgate. And there is yet a fourth
     copy, in MS. Sloane 554. The Royal MS. begins, more correctly:--'In
     suffisaunce of cunnyng and of wyt.'

[14] MS. i. 53.

[15] MS. B. 5. There is yet another MS. in the library of Trinity College,
     Oxford, no. 75; and others in the Bodleian Library (MS. Rawlinson
     151), in the Cambridge University Library (Gg. iv. 18), and in the
     Phillipps collection (as in note 5 below).

[16] 'The Boke of Comfort, translated into Englesse tonge. Enprented in the
     exempt Monastery of Tavestok in Denshyre, by me, Dan Thomas Rychard,
     Monke; 1525. 4to.'--Lowndes.

[17] The MS. is now in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps; no. 1099.

[18] He here implies that Chaucer's translation was by no means the only
     one then in existence; a remarkable statement.

[19] MS. inserts _full_, needlessly.

[20] _Perhaps read_ In.

[21] MS. neye.

[22] MS. hy_m_self.

[23] MS. theym self.

[24] _Printed_ feldes _by_ Mr. Stewart.

[25] Observe that this line is due to Chaucer's _gloss_, not to his text.

[26] MS. Thisee (!).

[27] MS. hem self.

[28] _Printed_ thise _by_ Mr. Stewart.

[29] MS. This (giving no sense).

[30] Mr. Stewart _omits_ thus.

[31] MS. parelous (!). This shews that Walton's text can be corrected by
     Chaucer's.

[32] Yet we must remember that 'The Former Age' only reproduces a _part_ of
     this Metre; and that it also introduces a passage from Jerome, besides
     reminiscences of Ovid and of Le Roman de la Rose; as shewn in the
     notes.

[33] Mr. Stewart adds another instance, from Bk. iii. met. 5. 5:--

       And that the last ile in the see
       That hight Tyle, be thral to thee.

     I hope this was unintentional, for they are poor verses. It is higher
     praise to say that, especially in the Metres, Chaucer's prose often
     flows well, with a certain melody of its own. Mr. Stewart also gives
     some instances in which he supposes that Chaucer 'actually reproduces
     the original Latin metre;' but they are imperfect and unintended.

[34] Mr. Stewart quotes this as: 'a long unagreable dwellynges;' but
     'draweth a-long' is a fair translation of 'protrahit.'

[35] 365 is the number of the line; see p. 164 below. I refer to Boethius
     by the letter 'B.', meaning the text as printed in the present volume,
     giving the _line_ of the text as well as the number of the Prose or
     Metre, so that every passage can easily be found.

[36] The prefixed asterisk marks a _doubtful_ or _wrong_ instance.

[37] I omit the comparison of Bk. iii. ll. 8-14 with Boethius; for the
     whole stanza is copied from the _Filostrato_, Bk. iii. st. 75. Also,
     that of l. 373 with B. iii. met. 9. 1; for l. 373 is copied from the
     _Filostrato_, Bk. iii. st. 15.

[38] I omit mention of l. 2839 (compared with B. ii. met. 3. 14); for it is
     taken from the _Teseide_, Bk. ix, 10, 11.

[39] The three points are: (1) Avarice is insatiable, l. 2321, which
     answers to 'finem quaerendi non inuenit,' quoted as from Seneca, but
     really from Palladius; see Albertani Brixiensis Liber Consolationis,
     ed. T. Sundby, p. 37: (2) Good and evil are two contraries, l. 2479;
     compare the same, p. 96: (3) Fortune the nurse, l. 2635, translated
     from 'fortuna usque nunc me fouit'; see the same, p. 89.

[40] I have noted a few inaccuracies, chiefly due to confusion of _c_ and
     _t_ (which are written alike), and to abbreviations. At p. 2, l. 13,
     for 'p_ro_cede' read 'p_er_cede.' At p. 9, l. 28, for 'basilicis' read
     'basilius.' At p. 11, l. 32, read 'auauntede.' At p. 12, l. 10, read
     'c_on_uict'; &c. Cf. note to Bk. v. pr. 6. 82.

[41] Here _recte_ is miswritten for _recta_, clearly because the scribe was
     still thinking of the latter syllable of the preceding _sponte_. But
     observe that Ch. has 'the rightes,' a translation of _recta_. This
     proves at once that Chaucer did not use _this particular copy_ as his
     original; and of course the peculiar mode in which it is written
     precludes such a supposition. But I believe it to be copied from
     Chaucer's copy, all the same.

[42] This shews how entirely wrong an editor would be who should change the
     forms into _Atrides_ and _Agamemnon_; unless, indeed, he were to give
     due notice. For it destroys the evidence. Note also, that _Agamenon_
     is the usual M. E. form. It appears as _Agamenoun_ in Troil. iii. 382.

[43] Hence it is easy to see that when Chaucer's glosses agree, as they
     sometimes do, with those in Notker's Old High German version or in any
     other version, the agreement is due to the fact that both translators
     had similar _Latin_ glosses before them.

[44] My text has _thonder-light_, as in the MSS.; but _leyte_ or _leyt_ is
     better; see note to the line (p. 422), and see above, p. xlii, l. 8.

[45] There is a later edition by Peiper, said to be the best; but it is out
     of print, and I failed to obtain a copy. But I have also collated the
     Latin text in the Delphin edition, ed. Valpy, 1823, and the edition by
     Renatus Vallinus, 1656; both of these contain useful notes.

[46] Mr. Rossetti has a note, shewing that Prof. Morley's figures are
     incorrect. He himself reckons _Troilus_ as containing 8246 lines,
     because the number of stanzas in Book V. of Dr. Furnivall's print of
     MS. Harl. 3943 is wrongly given as 268 instead of 267.

[47] For a fuller comparison with this poem, see § 21 below; p. lxv.

[48] Lydgate accepts Chaucer's view without question. He says--'And of this
     syege wrote eke Lollius'; Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. B 2, back.

[49] Usually called Guido de Colonna, probably because he was supposed to
     belong to a famous family named Colonna; but his name seems to have
     been taken from the name of a place (see note 1 on p. lvi). My
     quotations from Guido are from MS. Mm. 5. 14, in the Cambridge
     University Library.

[50] He refers to the story of Troy as existing 'in the Latyn and the
     Frenshe'; Siege of Troye, fol. B 1, back; and explains 'the Latyn' as
     'Guido.'

[51] In an Italian work entitled 'Testi Inediti di Storia Trojana,' by E.
     Gorra, Turin, 1887, a passage is quoted at p. 137, from Book XIII of
     Guido, which says that Terranova, on the S. coast of Sicily, was also
     called 'columpne Herculis,' and Gorra suggests that this was the place
     whence Guido derived his name 'delle Colonne.' At any rate, Guido was
     much interested in these 'columns'; see Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol.
     M 4. I think _Tropæus_, from Gk. [Greek: tropaia], may refer to these
     _columnæ_; or Guido may have been connected with _Tropea_, on the W.
     coast of Calabria, less than fifty miles from Messina, where he was a
     judge.

[52] 'Homerus ... fingens multa que non fuerunt, et que fuerunt aliter
     transformando'; Prologus. See the E. translation in the Gest
     Hystoriale, or alliterative Troy-book, ll. 38-47; Lydgate, Siege of
     Troye, fol. B 2.

[53] See allit. Troy-book, ll. 60-79.

[54] See allit. Troy-book, ll. 3922-34; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. F 3,
     back.

[55] MS. penatos.

[56] The mention of Escaphilo, i.e. Ascalaphus, in Book V. 319, was perhaps
     suggested by the mention of Ascalaphus by Guido (after Dictys, i. 13,
     Homer, Il. ii. 512) as being one of the Grecian leaders; see allit.
     Troy-book, l. 4067.

[57] I. e. glove; from Gk. [Greek: cheir], hand, and [Greek: thêkê], case.

[58] Put for xenium ([Greek: xenion]), a gift, present.

[59] Cf. 'And save hir browes ioyneden y-fere'; Troil. v. 813.

[60] _Talke_ is not in the Glossary. As _lk_ is a common way of writing
     _kk_ (as shewn in my paper on 'Ghost-words' for the Phil. Soc.), the
     word is really _takke_, a variant of _take_; and the sense is 'let him
     take.'

[61] Lydgate began his Troy-book on Oct. 31, 1412, and finished it in 1420;
     see this shewn in my letter to the _Academy_, May 7, 1892.

[62] Hence it was not written by Sir Hugh Eglintoun, if he died either in
     1376 or 1381; see Pref. to allit. Troy-book, pp. xvii, xxv.

[63] MS. to disport; _but_ to _is needless_.

[64] MS. I for; I _is needless_.

[65] Two false rimes; _ye_ and _aweye_; _dispyt_ and _bright_ (correctly,
     _bright e_).

[66] Not _clene_, as in the St. John's MS. and in the Phillipps MS.; for
     Chaucer never rimes _clene_ (with open _e_) with such words as
     _grene_, _quene_ (with close _e_); see, on this point, the remarks on
     my Rime-Index to Troilus, published for the Chaucer Society. MS. Harl.
     2392 likewise has _sheene_, a word in which the long _e_ is of
     'variable' quality.

[67] Some guess that it means 'Tres gentil Chaucer.' But this seems to me
     very improbable, if not stupid.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
